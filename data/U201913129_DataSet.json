Overall, therefore, 26 deaths due to infections with the Coronavirus have been identified, as reported by authorities in China.\nCompared to the previous day, the number of known infections of 644 has increased to 830 cases. On Thursday, on the eve of the Chinese New Year's Eve, China had placed nearly twenty million people under quarantine in the fight against the disease. Authorities are calling off the 11-million-city of Wuhan, where most cases have occurred. The total number of cities affected by severe restrictions, including Wuhan, rose to at least eight by Friday. For example, Lichuan, Xianning and Huangshi also announced to stop bus lines and other local traffic. All the cities concerned are located in the province of Hubei.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) saw no reason on Thursday evening to call for an international emergency. \"This is not the right time,\" said the chairman of the emergency committee, Didier Houssin. He pointed out that there have so far been few cases abroad and that China has already taken far-reaching measures of its own.\nWHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said China had taken the measures it considered appropriate. \"We hope they are effective and short-lived,\" he said. The WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions. The Foreign Office in Berlin, however, advised to postpone unnecessary travel to the affected areas. The risk to German travellers in Wuhan is considered to be \"moderate\".\nThe WHO takes the outbreak extremely seriously, said WHO chief Tedros. \"It is not yet an international emergency, but it can still be,\" he said.\nYeah.\nFederal Health Minister Jens Spahn called for a prudent approach to the new lung disease that has broken out in China. \"We take this very seriously, we are vigilant, but also with a cool head at the same time,\" said the CDU politician on Thursday evening in the ARD \"Daily Topics\". You have a daily exchange with experts. \"I also think it is important that we sort this out in such a way that we can then also take the necessary rest.\"\nSpain praised the information policy of the Chinese government. Unlike the major Sars epidemic, which killed hundreds of people in China seventeen years ago, the international community's exchange works and China is also more transparent than it was a few years ago. It is therefore better to prepare for this. Spahn said it was important to classify the disease and pointed out the flu that killed around 20000 people every year in Germany. \"This is also a risk that we have every day.\" In the new lung disease, the incidence of infection is milder compared to this.\nAccording to Chinese authorities on Friday, another patient died outside the particularly affected province of Hubei, including the city of Wuhan, and the death was reported in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. The day before yesterday, a death had already become known in the northern province of Hebei.\nMost of the victims were elderly people with pre-existing illnesses. Infections are now known in most Chinese provinces. In some cases the virus has also been detected in patients in other countries such as Thailand and the USA.\nHealth authorities in South Korea reported for the second time on Friday an infection with the new lung disease that broke out in neighbouring China. Concerned with a 55-year-old South Korean, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Friday\nYeah.\nThe man then returned on Wednesday from a work stay in Wuhan, where the origin of the outbreak is suspected. On Thursday the first proven case was announced in Singapore. Japan reported a second case six months before the Olympic Games began in Tokyo. The man in his 40s is from Wuhan, the Ministry of Health reported on Friday. The man was visiting Japan. He's being treated at a hospital in Tokyo, they said.\nSo far, no case is known in Europe. According to German infectious specialists, isolated cases of the new lung disease are \"probable\" here as well. However, there was no cause for concern, the German Society for Infectiology reported. Clinics are currently preparing to respond quickly to these cases. (dpa)\n",

In any case, after delay, hesitation and even being suspected of concealing, the authorities wanted to show their determination to stop the massive spread of pneumonia in Wuhan. This is the most important news in China, but the front page headline of the people's daily newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is \"the central leading comrades visit the old comrades\". The Central Committee of the Party headed by Xi Jinping visited the former general secretary Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, and so on, especially by Xi Jinping. Then Xi Jinping was invited to speak with Germany and the French president, and then Xi Jinping visited Yunnan and went to Yunnan Wa village to hear the new song of the Wa people. There was no headline on the Internet that sealed the city in Wuhan.\nSome people question, \"is there anything more important than the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan? Please see people's daily. The common people are regarded as ants; the noble temperament changes the people into kneeling people \". There is an allusion behind this couplet. Not long ago, the party media had an article which touted Xi Jinping's common feelings and aristocratic temperament.\nAnother netizen wrote: \"the mainstream media all over the world are very concerned about the new coronavirus epidemic in China, and have done a lot of reports. Only the Chinese Communist Party media deliberately desalinated the world class epidemic. This is the mode of \"governing the country\" by Xi Jinping and the Communist Party of China. P's life and death is not a big deal. Tens of millions of people are blocked in the epidemic area without affecting the overall situation.\nIn the morning saw people's daily arranged in this way, people saw the Beijing people's great hall singing and dancing in the afternoon. Xi Jinping led a group of people to worship in the Spring Festival. Xi Jinping delivered a speech in which he said that the well-off society that the Chinese nation had been longing for for thousands of years was about to become a reality, but did not send a condolence to the suffering Han people. \"At the ceremony, the party and leaders of the near Equality Party shook hands with each other, greeted each other, congratulations on the new spring festival, and the writers and artists performed wonderful programs.\" some people asked, \"the whole country is howling, is it good to hear the singing and dancing?\"\nDeng Yuwen, a researcher at the China strategic analysis think tank, commented: \"the central and local governments are rising and dancing.\". Everyone seems to be OK. If it is a custom to hold Spring Festival Group worship in Zhongnanhai, adding a few words about Wuhan in Xi's speech will not damage the festival atmosphere, and also highlight the concern for people's livelihood, but not. Of course, they will argue that there should be a festive atmosphere. This is a typical feature of totalitarian regime. As long as the above does not speak, the following will do it even though they know it is absurd\n\"\nThe place mentioned here in the \"central local singing and dancing promotion\" refers to what happened in the \"base camp\" of Wuhan pneumonia. Just on the 21st, when the situation of Wuhan pneumonia can no longer be covered, the Secretary of the provincial Party committee and the governor attended the group visit with singing and dancing. A city suffering from the new pneumonia, the citizens were frightened all day long, causing the world uneasiness, senior officials, Still in accordance with the inertia, they attended the Spring Festival Group worship party in three cheers and five cheers. They were entertained by wine and banquets, singing and dancing were pleasing to the eyes. What's more, some actors of Hubei National Song and dance troupe who performed the group worship performed \"perfect performance\" for leaders with illness and injury. The report said, \"we all took layers of masks to overcome the panic of pneumonia. The actor Yi Hanzhang ran for a long time and caught a cold. When waiting for the stage, he was cold all over, and after the stage, the fire was fully open. The actresses overcame many difficulties, such as cold and stuffy nose, physical discomfort, and performed perfectly with illness and injury.\" Social networks in China are full of reviled comments. Wuhan was hit by a major disaster. The leaders of Wuhan delayed to release the disaster situation. Now the whole world is in a hurry. The leaders there still have fun singing and dancing. It's amazing to watch the program. Since Thursday, when tens of millions of people have been blocked from entering and leaving, the behavior of senior officials in Wuhan is even more eye-catching.\nIt is true that if Xi Jinping has Xi Jinping's delegation, then why can't the Hubei provincial Party Secretary Jiang Chaoliang and governor Wang Xiaodong of Hubei have their own group meeting?\n",

But it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one,\" said Tedros.\nDeclaring the disease a global health emergency would have required countries to step up the international response.\nScrambling to contain the outbreak, the local government in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people at the center of the outbreak, suspended most transport on Thursday and people were told not to leave. Hours later, neighboring Huanggang, a city of about 7 million people, announced similar measures.\n\"The lockdown of 11 million people is unprecedented in public health history,\" said Gauden Galea, the WHO's representative in Beijing.\nThe organisation said, however, that it was not yet recommending any broader restrictions on travel or trade.\n\"China has taken measures it believes is appropriate to contain the spread of coronavirus in Wuhan and other cities. We hope they will be both effective and short in their duration,\" said Tedros\n.\nPeter Piot, a professor of global health and director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the outbreak was at a critical phase.\n\"Regardless of the decision not to declare this a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, intensified international collaboration and more resources will be crucial to stopping this outbreak in its tracks,\" he said, adding, \"There cannot be any complacency as to the need for global action.\"\nThe previously unknown virus strain is believed to have emerged late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China.\nChinese state television said 634 cases had been confirmed. By the end of Wednesday, China's National Health Commission confirmed 17 dead in Hubei. The first confirmed death outside Hubei - an 80-year-old man in Hebei, just south of Beijing - was also announced by health authorities.\nNon-fatal cases have also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States.\nFive people were being tested in Scotland for coronavirus as a precaution, the BBC reported on Thursday. All had respiratory symptoms and had recently been in Wuhan, it said.\nThe newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are a number of unknowns surrounding it. It is too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people.\nThere is no vaccine for the virus, which can spread through the respiratory transmission. Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing, similar to many other respiratory illnesses.\nMichael Ryan, head of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, said data from China suggested almost three-quarters of the cases were in people aged over 40, with some 40 per cent having underlying health conditions.\nThree research teams are to start work on developing a vaccine, a global coalition set up to fight diseases said\n.\nPreliminary research suggested the virus was passed on to humans from snakes, but Chinese government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan has also identified badgers and rats as possible sources.\nThe biggest tumble in Chinese stocks in more than eight months led global equity markets lower on Thursday as concern mounted about the outbreak.\nTRAVEL WARNINGS\nIn Wuhan, the Hankou railway station was nearly deserted on Thursday, state broadcasts showed. State media reported highway toll booths around Wuhan were closing, effectively cutting off road exits, and all ride-hailing services would be canceled from Friday. Guards were patrolling highways, one resident said.\nAs the city slipped into isolation, residents thronged hospitals for medical checks and rushed to buy supplies, clearing out supermarket shelves and queuing for petrol.\nOther cities were also taking steps to contain the virus.\nNearby Ezhou shut train stations. Beijing canceled large gatherings, including two Lunar New Year temple fairs, and closed the Forbidden City, the capital's most famous tourist attraction, to visitors until further notice.\nThe US State Department warned travelers to exercise increased caution in China as airports worldwide were screening passengers arriving from the country.\nChinese-ruled Hong Kong, which has two confirmed cases, is turning two holiday camps into quarantine stations as a precaution.\nTaiwan has banned anyone from Wuhan from going to the island.\nChinese people had their own ways of protecting themselves.\n\"I go straight to where I need to go, and then I go home,\" said 79-year-old Li Meihua, from behind a mask, on the streets of Shanghai. \"I'm also maintaining a cleaner diet.

Such a designation would have required countries to step up the international response.\n\"Make no mistake, though, this is an emergency in China,\" said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\"It has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one,\" he said.\nScrambling to contain the outbreak, the local government in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in Hubei province, suspended most transport on Thursday, including outgoing flights, and people were told not to leave.\nHours later, neighbouring Huanggang, a city of about 7 million people, announced similar measures.\n\"The lockdown of 11 million people is unprecedented in public health history,\" said Gauden Galea, the WHO's representative in Beijing.\nThe organisation said, however, that it was not yet recommending any broader restrictions on travel or trade\n.\nThe previously unknown virus strain is believed to have emerged late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan.\nIt has created alarm because there are a number of unknowns surrounding it. It is too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people.\nThere is no vaccine for the virus, which can spread through respiratory transmission. Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing.\nMichael Ryan, head of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said data from China suggested almost three-quarters of the cases were in people aged over 40, with some 40 per cent having underlying health conditions.\n\"At the moment, we haven't seen many mild cases,\" he said, cautioning that it was difficult at the start of an epidemic to estimate the severity or true fatality rate.\nThere had been human-to-human transmission of the virus in China, limited to family groups and health workers, said Tedros.\nThree research teams working on a vaccine, a global coalition set up to fight diseases said. It is aiming to have a shot developed and approved within a year.\nThe committee of 16 independent experts had been divided in its conclusion not to declare a global emergency, said Tedros, adding that the decision \"should not be taken as a sign that the WHO does not think the situation is serious.\"\nPeter Piot, a professor of global health and director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the outbreak was at a critical phase.\n\"Regardless of the decision not to declare this a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, intensified international collaboration and more resources will be crucial to stopping this outbreak in its tracks,\" he said. \"There cannot be any complacency as to the need for global action.\"\nThe biggest tumble in Chinese stocks in more than eight months led global equity markets lower on Thursday as concern mounted about the outbreak\n.\nTRAVEL WARNINGS\nIn Wuhan, the Hankou railway station was nearly deserted on Thursday, state broadcasts showed. State media reported highway toll booths around Wuhan were closing, effectively cutting off road exits, and all ride-hailing services would be cancelled from Friday. Guards were patrolling highways, one resident said.\nAs the city slipped into isolation, residents thronged hospitals for medical checks and rushed to buy supplies, clearing out supermarket shelves and queuing for petrol.\nOther cities were also taking steps to contain the virus.\nNearby Ezhou shut train stations. Beijing cancelled large gatherings, including two Lunar New Year temple fairs, and closed the Forbidden City, the capital's most famous tourist attraction, to visitors until further notice.\nThe US State Department warned travellers to exercise increased caution in China as airports worldwide stepped up the screening of passengers arriving from the country.\nCases have already been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States.\nFive people were being tested in Scotland for the virus as a precaution, the BBC reported on Thursday. All had respiratory symptoms and had recently been in Wuhan, it said.\nChinese-ruled Hong Kong, which has two confirmed cases, is turning two holiday camps into quarantine stations as a precaution.\nTaiwan has banned anyone from Wuhan from going to the island.\nChinese people had their own ways of protecting themselves.\n\"I go straight to where I need to go, and then I go home,\" said 79-year-old Li Meihua, from behind a mask, on the streets of Shanghai.'\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "In China, the number of deaths caused by the new Coronavirus has risen again. The\nThe Health Committee of the GOC announced that 26 people had died of diseases caused by the agent. Other 1.072 disease cases suspected to have been caused by the virus, but these cases were still being investigated. Overall, as reported by the GOC in its new balance sheet, the number of registered diseases from 644 to 830 increased. The previous report\nThe authorities had reported 18-deaths and about 570 cases of disease.\nDespite the rapid spread of the virus in China, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has not yet declared a \"health emergency of international importance\". A council of experts, which advises the WHO, saw no reason for this on Thursday.\" It is not the right time,\"said the chairman of the emergency committee, Didier Houssin. There are so far few cases abroad and China has already taken far-reaching measures of its own.\nThe health organisation hopes that China's actions are \"effective and short-term,\" said WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The WHO takes the outbreak extremely seriously. There is no emergency yet, but that could change, said Ghebreyesus. The WHO does not currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. The Foreign Office in Berlin advised to postpone unnecessary travel to the affected areas. The risk to German travellers in Wuhan is assessed as \"moderate\".\nOther patients infected with the Coronavirus have also been reported from other countries. A new suspicion of infection has been reported in the USA\nYeah. A patient in Texan Brazos County, who had left the Chinese city of Wuhan, was possibly infected with the virus, the authorities reported. The diagnosis has not yet been confirmed. The man was temporarily isolated in his home until a blood test could clarify.\nOn Tuesday, a first case of the Coronavirus was confirmed in the United States. A patient who had also travelled from Wuhan contacted the authorities near the capital Seattle itself. The man's better now. He's about to be released from the hospital.\nA second case of lung disease has also been reported in Japan. The man in his 40s comes from the Chinese capital Wuhan, the Ministry of Health reported. He was visiting Japan and is being treated in a hospital in Tokyo, it was said. A few days earlier, another Chinese agent had already been tested positive for the pathogen. The man living in Tokyo's neighbouring province of Kanagawa had returned to Japan after a visit to Wuhan. He's been released from the clinic.\nSix months before the Olympic Games began in Tokyo, Japan stepped up its precautions against the new virus.\" We will do our utmost to prevent the spread of infections,\"said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Companies operating in Wuhan urged their employees to stay at home.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV\nYeah. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transfers after about a dozen medical personnel cases have been reported.\nYeah. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nThe Chinese capital Beijing knitted all major events and temple festivals on the occasion of the Chinese New Year's Eve on Saturday. The tourism authority announced that \"the accumulation of people should be reduced\".\nPrior to that, China had quarantined virtually millions of people in the fight against the disease just before the New Year's feast. The authorities are recalling the eleven million-capital city of Wuhan, where most cases have occurred. The total number of cities affected by severe restrictions, including Wuhans, rose from five to at least eight\nYeah. For example, Lichuan, Xianning and Huangshi also announced to stop bus lines and other local traffic. All the cities concerned are located in the province of Hubei.\nOutside China, apart from the USA and Japan, individual cases from Thailand, South Korea and Taiwan have so far been reported.\n",

He said that with the arrival of China's Spring Festival, it is imperative that relevant agencies at this stage improve the effectiveness of monitoring and take the right strategy to curb the spread of the virus.\nStandford said that Wuhan pneumonia and (2019-ncov) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers COV) belong to the same family, which has increased people's concern about the possibility of large-scale transmission of the new virus; in addition, similar to SARS CoV and mers CoV, the existing evidence shows that medical staff care for patients with infection There is also a risk of infection.\nHe said that at present, there are confirmed cases in Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai and other cities. On the other hand, there are also cases in Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and the United States. These patients outside China are all tourists from China. Based on the rapid spread of the epidemic, coupled with the analysis of disease models, he agrees with the British researchers' statement that the actual number of infections may be greatly underestimated. He said it is estimated that at least 1700 people around the world have been infected with the virus.\nThe emergence of this new virus has attracted public attention because there are still several key questions about the characteristics of Wuhan coronavirus that have not been answered, including how to spread the virus, the efficiency of human to human transmission, and the source of human and animal diseases of Wuhan coronavirus.\nAs with any virus that can be replicated in the human body, the mutation of the virus will change the infectivity, resulting in a great risk of epidemic transmission, said standyford. Especially during the coming Chinese new year price, it is expected that a large number of people will take a ride and travel by air. How to improve effective monitoring and put forward a correct strategy against the spread of the virus will become particularly important.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "China moved to lock down at least three cities with a combined population of more than 18 million in an unprecedented effort to contain the deadly new virus that has sickened hundreds of people and spread to other parts of the world during the busy Lunar New Year holiday.\nThe open-ended lockdowns are unmatched in size, embracing more people than New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago put together.\nThe train station and airport in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, were shut down, and ferry, subway and bus service was halted. Normally bustling streets, shopping malls, restaurants and other public spaces in the city of 11 million were eerily quiet. Police checked all incoming vehicles but did not close off the roads.\nSimilar measures were being imposed on Friday in the nearby cities of Huanggang and Ezhou. In Huanggang, theaters, internet cafes and other entertainment centers were also ordered closed.\nIn the capital, Beijing, major events were canceled indefinitely, including traditional temple fairs that are a staple of holiday celebrations, to stop the spread of the virus.\nThe Forbidden City, the palace complex in Beijing that is now a museum, announced it will close indefinitely on Saturday.\nChina's National Health Commission said on Friday morning the confirmed cases of the new coronavirus had risen to 830 with 25 deaths.\nThe first death was also confirmed outside the central province of Hubei, where the capital, Wuhan, has been the epicenter of the outbreak.\nThe health commission in Hebei, a northern province bordering Beijing, said an 80-year-old man died after returning from a two-month stay in Wuhan to see relatives.\nThe vast majority of cases have been in and around Wuhan or people with connections the city. Other cases have been confirmed in the United States, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Thailand\n. Singapore and Vietnam reported their first cases Thursday, and cases have also been confirmed in the Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macao.\nMany countries are screening travelers from China for symptoms of the virus, which can cause fever, coughing, breathing difficulties and pneumonia.\nThe World Health Organization has decided against declaring the outbreak a global emergency, a step that can bring more money and resources to fight a threat but that can also cause trade and travel restrictions and other economic damage, making the decision a politically fraught one.\nThe decision \"should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious or that we're not taking it seriously. Nothing could be further from the truth,\" WHO Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said. \"WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day.\"\nChinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns of the cities will last. While sweeping measures are typical of China's Communist Party-led government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world, even in deadly epidemics, because of concerns about infringing on people's liberties. And the effectiveness of such measures is unclear.\n\"To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science,\" said Gauden Galea, the WHO?s representative in China. \"It has not been tried before as a public health measure. We cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.\"\nJonathan Ball, a professor of virology at molecular virology at the University of Nottingham in Britain, said the lockdowns appear to be justified scientifically.\n\"Until there's a better understanding of what the situation is, I think it's not an unreasonable thing to do,\" he said. \"Anything that limits people's travels during an outbreak would obviously work.\"\nBut Ball cautioned that any such quarantine should be strictly time-limited\n. He added: \"You have to make sure you communicate effectively about why this is being done. Otherwise you will lose the goodwill of the people.\"\nDuring the devastating West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014, Sierra Leone imposed a national three-day quarantine as health workers went door to door, searching for hidden cases. Burial teams collecting corpses and people taking the sick to Ebola centers were the only ones allowed to move freely. Frustrated residents complained of food shortages.\nIn China, the illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus first appeared last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub. Local authorities demanded all residents wear masks in public places and urged civil servants wear them at work.\nAfter the city was closed off Thursday, images showed long lines and empty shelves at supermarkets, as people stocked up. Trucks carrying supplies into the city are not being restricted, although many Chinese recall shortages in the years before the country's recent economic boom.\nAnalysts predicted cases will continue to multiply, although the jump in numbers is also attributable in part to increased monitoring.\n\"Even if (cases) are in the thousands, this would not surprise us,\" the WHO's Galea said, adding, however, that the number of infected is not an indicator of the outbreak's severity so long as the death rate remains low.\nThe coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which is thought to have originated from camels.\nChina is keen to avoid repeating mistakes with its handling of SARS. For months, even after the illness had spread around the world, China parked patients in hotels and drove them around in ambulances to conceal the true number of cases and avoid WHO experts\n. This time, China has been credited with sharing information rapidly, and President Xi Jinping has emphasized that as a priority.\nHealth authorities are taking extraordinary measures to prevent the spread of the virus, placing those believed infected in plastic tubes and wheeled boxes, with air passed through filters.\nThe first cases in the Wuhan outbreak were connected to people who worked at or visited a seafood market, now closed for an investigation. Experts suspect that the virus was first transmitted from wild animals but that it may also be mutating. Mutations can make it deadlier or more contagious.\n",

After the abrupt quarantine imposed from Thursday to Wuhan, the city of 11 million inhabitants focus of infection, the authorities have ordered the isolation of four others nearby. Huanggang, 7.5 million, will close its railway station from this midnight. Do the same the smallest relatively Ezhou, of a population of one million residents. Two other smaller towns, Chibi and Zhijiang, have also restricted the movements of their neighbors.\nThe World Health Organization has ruled this afternoon to declare the international alert, but also said it could meet again for this reason in the coming days. WHO has warned: \"The global community must be prepared\".\nIn Huanggang, located about 70 kilometers from Wuhan, public transport and trains will stop leaving their station it will stop until further notice. They also remain closed public meeting places such as cafes or cinemas, according to a local government. Residents have been ordered not to leave the town unless special circumstances. Ezhou, about 60 kilometers, will stop working train stations.\nChinese in other large cities, local governments have announced the cancellation of public celebrations of the Lunar New Year, starting this Saturday, to prevent contagion. Mayor of Beijing announced the cancellation of large events: no popular temple fairs, which bring together thousands of people in some of the parks and busiest in the capital temples with an offer of shows traditional will be held and games. A measure that adds to Wuhan, the autonomous region of Macau and the coastal province of Zhejiang.\nIn that province, Hangzhou city of 9.8 million inhabitants, has announced that these days suspend their shows and tours on larger boats in its West Lake, its main tourist attraction. museums are also closed and other points where visitors tend to congregate.\nThe most recent data on the coronavirus known as Wuhan 2019-nCoV place where 25 dead and 830 infected, about one hundred more than the figures of the previous day. The new deceased has been notified by the authorities of Hebei Province and is the first that occurs outside of Wuhan. The pathogen has arrived in Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore and the United States.\n25 dead, according to official data released Thursday has the National Health Commission of China, are mostly men. Almost all of above 70 years old and with pictures of other diseases ages. The youngest victim is a 48 year old woman with a history of diabetes and cerebral infarction. All they are residing in the province of Hubei, where the cities under quarantine.\nWhile growing concern about the virus, which expands coinciding with the travel season for Lunar New Year -the largest mobilization of the world, which are estimated about 3,000 million desplazamientos-, a study published by a team of five scientists from various Chinese universities notes that snakes are probably the animal that transmitted the pathogen to humans.\nChinese authorities had traced the source of infection in Huanan market in Wuhan City, the seventh of the country and a major transportation hub that has been isolated from quarantine Thursday. In this market, although its official name described it as a selling point of seafood and fish, numerous species of wild animals sold from wolf pups bats. The National Health Commission admitted that the virus was transmitted from one animal to humans, but did not specify what species could be treated.\nA first study published Tuesday in the journal Science China Life Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, had analyzed the relationship between the new coronavirus and the like. Among its findings, he had found that the pathogen was closely related to a strain that infects bats. But he had also indicated the likelihood of contagion had occurred through an intermediate animal. However, the five Chinese scientists report published by the Journal of Medical Virology suggests that animal is probably a snake.\n\"The 2019-nCoV appears to be a recombinant virus between coronavirus bats and other coronavirus of unknown origin\" to experts. \"Our research concludes that the snake is the most likely wild animal\".\nThe study, remember that snakes were among the species sold in the market Wuhan, states that in southeastern China, the area where is this city are endemic two species, Chinese or Naja atra cobra and Bulgarus multicinctus. Snakes \"were also sold in the market for Huanan, where many of the patients worked or had a history of exposure to farm animals or wild,\" they explain.\nAlthough consumption is unusual, snake meat is prized in Chinese tradition for its alleged aphrodisiac properties, to provide heat in winter and give a healthier looking skin.\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which in 2003 killed about 700 people in China and other countries, was linked to the consumption of civet meat, a wild cat native to South and Southeast Asia.",

So large hospitals Spaniards before the outbreak stalking China and has reached nine other countries on board international flights are prepared. Not for now the case of Spain: the Ministry of Health reported Friday that two suspected cases under study, people with respiratory ailments recently arrived in Wuhan, have tested negative to the tests. But late in the evening the Basque Country reported that they had a patient with some suspicious symptoms he was under surveillance and had recently visited Wuhan.\n\"We are following with great interest all, but quietly. It is highly unlikely that the new virus becomes a major problem in Spain, \"notes Santiago Moreno, head of the infectious diseases service Ramón y Cajal Hospital (Madrid). This position coincides with that held by the ministry. \"People have to have a level of perceived very low risk,\" said Fernando Simon, director of the Center for Coordination and Emergency Health Alerts in the presentation of the measures agreed by Health and autonomous regions.\nThree ideas are the most repeated by experts consulted by this newspaper. The first is that what is known about the virus is still little. \"We do not know the rate of transmissibility, which tells us how many people spread each case. Nor do we know if there are asymptomatic or very mild symptoms cases, \"explains Jesús Rodríguez Bathroom, chief of the infectious diseases service of the Virgen Macarena (Sevilla) hospital.\nThe second is that, with the available data, the Wuhan seems less virulent than the other coronavirus that caused epidemic outbreaks since 2002. \"Mortality is less than 5%, while SARS and MERS were much higher [10% and 35%, respectively],\" says Juan Carlos Galan, spokesman for the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology (SEIMC). In addition, \"although it has been demonstrated transmission from person to person, does not seem too high, lower than in the SARS\" says Magda Campins, head of Preventive Medicine of the Vall d'Hebron (Barcelona) hospital.\nAs a third important idea, experts conclude that, until the investigations progress and international agencies establish more precise recommendations, it is advisable to \"adopt here the necessary steps to be prepared if a case goes,\" said José Miguel Cisneros, head of service infectious diseases of the Hospital Virgen de Rocio. \"And rest assured, because our public health system and our hospitals are amply prepared to deal with an episode like this,\" he adds.\nThe first measures taken by hospitals are to \"prepare protocols for emergency personnel, which is the gateway to the hospital,\" says Campins. \"The goal is to determine if the patient has symptoms consistent with the virus and if you have recently traveled to Wuhan\" he adds. If two events coincide, \"the patient should be admitted in isolation and medical personnel take precautionary measures usual until you discard or confirm that the disease is caused by the virus,\" says Rodríguez bathroom. These measures go through \"hand protection and respiratory barriers, such as masks high degree of protection in case there airborne\" he adds.\nThe instructions are finalizing the Ministry of Health and the Autonomous Communities establish that samples of all suspected patients will be sent to the National Microbiology Center (CNM), which will be the reference and have the results in about a day. But large hospitals have a technology called PCR, which allows advancing the diagnosis in a few hours. \"We are acquiring specific kits to genetically identify the virus with PCR Wuhan,\" says Campins. \"We have ordered the purchase and we will arrive on Monday,\" they explained from the Ramón y Cajal.\nFernando Simon said on Friday that if a positive case is detected, it will track contact, but the virus does not have \"a lot of transmissibility\". On a flight, for example, the evolution of the two passengers seated beside it would follow. The aim is that the public network is the sensitivity to detect cases without blocking the healthcare system. Health does not arise for now take exceptional measures at airports, since there are no direct flights from Wuhan and is a measure \"that has not proved useful,\" said Simon. He explained that it is very common for passengers coming from long flights suffer respiratory symptoms, more in winter, so apply controls on arrivals \"would not provide a benefit enough.\"\nHealth concludes that \"it is not very likely, but it can happen,\" the virus reaches Spain. \"So we are ready to act,\" said Simon, who recalled that the most important thing in these outbreaks are performances origin and considers that quarantines in China reduce risk.",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The day begins with the same ritual: at the door of the hotel, a thermometer on the forehead of everyone who passes. The receptionist reassures a guest: \"We have supplies to spare, get a lot of products before blocking, do not worry.\" Second day quarantine in Wuhan, a population that can not leave or enter, being the source of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV. The latest official data provided by the Chinese authorities place on Saturday where 41 deaths and more than 1,100 infected in China, and another 20 in nine countries. At the epicenter of the outbreak, the inhabitants of the city they collect food before celebrate tonight, lunar new year.\nDuring a walk five kilometers just four passersby appear. In addition to them, the only signs of life came from inside a pet store, where three cats sleep curled up. The door is closed local and bolted with large padlock. In the center of the city it seems to have more life. Sweepers brooms changed by fumigators, basting with soil and facades of buildings. A man charged with two bulging bags, which carries all kinds of food. \"You have to buy things, Wuhan is closed!\" Exclaims maintaining a distance of three meters to the caller before proceeding.\nThe siege causes many people put towards supermarkets and malls, looking for products that supply their pantries before a closure that does not have an expiration date. shared images on social networks show fights in section greengrocers, empty boxes in frozen. On the shelves of the small grocery store that owns Shenglong, however, nothing is missing. Where appropriate, the audience has already passed. \"Today they have only been ten customers, but yesterday and the day before people kept going,\" he says, \"they took, especially, water containers, the bigger the better.\"\nShenglong confesses uneasy about the evolution of the virus, particularly because two of the hospitals where infected receive treatment, Tongji and Wuhan Union, are only a few blocks away. is not worried about any lack of supply: \"All the shops have huge stores, there are plenty of food for everyone. In addition, in Wuhan we help each other. Here nobody will go hungry, that's for sure. \" In the event that the situation drags on, \"the [Chinese military] People's Liberation Army will bring food if necessary\". you have no doubt. \"In any case, I'm the least worried of all,\" reiterates laughing, \"I have all this store for me!\".\nOnly a scarce product, perhaps the most important. Two streets away, a group of people queuing in front of a pharmacy with the blinds down. They all want the same thing: masks. This object has become the first line of defense of the people of Wuhan against coronavirus and yesterday their use is mandatory in public spaces. Each person in the street is yours, just a beggar dares to tempt fate.\nEarly in the afternoon, the few shops that remain open throw the closing. At the outbreak calendar adds: Today is chuxi, the eve of the lunar new year, the closest thing to the New Year in Chinese tradition. Custom dictates that this is a family holiday. Under normal conditions, during the holiday week that starts more than 3,000 million journeys would occur. It is the largest human migration in the world. Many take advantage of these days to go home and spend time with his family. Much are migrants who have left their families behind, often also their children, looking for job opportunities in big cities. This week is the only reunion of the year. The appearance of the coronavirus at this time is a double cause for sadness.\nThat happens to Wu Han, who shares a name with his hometown. This 31 year old woman living in Beijing, where he works as a school teacher. \"On 20 January, when the number of infections began to increase, I decided to stay and not go home,\" he says by phone from the capital. Luckily for her, her parents are also in Beijing; They had gone to spend a few weeks to lend a hand after the birth of her first child. \"Still, many families have been trapped. For security reasons, they have decided to celebrate the new year separately. \" Although small, Wu Han is engraved in the memory of SARS also emerged in China in 2002 and killed more than 700 people worldwide after becoming a global pandemic. \"In school we measured the temperature constantly and classrooms were sterilized every day,\" he recalls. \"I hope that does not happen anything like that.\"\nHu Shan home, to the contrary, the parties live normally. Ella, who also lives in Beijing, announced the dates of his visit to spend more time with their parents and now does not know when will return. \"I've spent the last four days at home, but when I went for the first time and saw the deserted streets became aware of the seriousness of the situation,\" explains the 25 year old. His parents have not fallen prey to panic. \"My mother tried to go buy supplies a couple of days ago, but when he came to the supermarket and saw the size of the queue just turned around.\" Not discuss much about the outbreak including limited to \"share articles with tips acting in the family chat\". Today they will dine like any other chinese new year, all three together, and then sit on the couch to watch national television gala. When they wake up, it has begun the year of the Rat Metal. And Wuhan will remain a closed city.",

Contagions on the boat reach 20 and placed Japan as the country most affected by the disease outside China, with a total of 45 cases.\nWhile those infected have been evacuated and transferred to medical facilities, other passengers will have to respect the quarantine and stay on the boat for two weeks, but are negative in tests. The 10 new positive part 71 results confirmed Thursday, according to Japanese authorities. A total of 273 people have been examined time. Diamond Princess had sailed from Yokohama on 20 January and docked at the port of Kagoshima and Okinawa Japanese, as well as in Hong Kong, where a passenger infected rose that has infected others.\nHong Kong is in a similar situation with the Dream World Cruise docked in the former British colony with 1,800 people inside after the Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung denied entry Tuesday. Three travelers from mainland China, who had been on board between 19 and January 24, tested positive for the virus. The three landed in the Chinese city of Guangzhou on 24. Health authorities have reported that 33 crew members have developed symptoms of respiratory tract infection and three have been sent to the hospital after a fever isolation. All but one have been negative for coronavirus.\nWith a total of 21 confirmed cases, including one death, Hong Kong this Saturday imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine all visitors from mainland China, but not completely close the border.\nIn addition to prohibiting the berthing of the ship, Taiwan health authorities have banned the entry of all international cruises from Thursday. Many tourists from the Diamond Princess landed on the island for a day trip on 31 January.\nVirgin Australia said Thursday it withdraws all its services between Australia and Hong Kong for its commercial impracticability, becoming the first international airline to do so.\nThe National Health Commission of China said Thursday 73 new deaths, representing a total of 564 and for the third consecutive day surpassing the record of daily deaths. Of the 73 deaths, 70 occurred in Hubei province which is the capital of Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic. The other three occurred in the city of Tianjin, in the northern province of Heilongjiang and Guizhou, to the southwest.\nAccording to the latest count, there were 28,060 confirmed cases, of which 3,859 are serious. There are 24,702 suspected cases have already been cured 1,153 people, more than double the deceased.\n2019-nCoV coronavirus can cause pneumonia with symptoms such as high fever, dry cough, headache and shortness of breath. Its average incubation period is three to seven days, with a maximum of 14. The Chinese scientists say that, unlike SARS, it is possible contagion during incubation. WHO has declared an international emergency outbreak.\nHundreds of experts from that organization will meet in Geneva next week, on 11 and 12 February, to encourage the search for drugs and vaccines against the coronavirus, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). A team led by the body will go to China \"very soon\", he said his spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said, adding that even \"there is no known treatment against coronavirus 2019-nCoV\".\nThe City of Dali City, in China's Yunan (southwest) province, has been accused this week of \"emergency requisition\" a cargo of masks intended for neighboring Chongqing, according to state media, quoted by Reuters. The move has sparked outrage on Chinese social networks, accusing them of robbing the city of Dali, with only eight confirmed cases of the coronavirus, compared to 400 registered in Chongqing.\nDali authorities claimed that they could not return the masks because they had already distributed 598 boxes. According to state television, the head of the Department of Health Dali has been fired for this case. This case is just one example of the difficulty faced by hospitals and cities across the country to get medical supplies, especially masks.\nIn the absence of specific treatment, China began Thursday the third and final phase of clinical trials with antiviral Remdesivir in Wuhan. The trial involved 761 patients, 308 with moderate symptoms and 453 in serious condition.\nRemdesivir was developed by US biotech company Gilead Science to treat Ebola. Its use has not yet been approved by any country in case of coronavirus. According to the Chinese middle Caixin, Gilead Science has given the Chinese Ministry of Health its full support for the use of Remdesivir in clinical trials.\nDisappeared from the public scene since 25 January, Chinese President Xi Jinping said Wednesday that China has \"confidence\" and \"ability\" to win the battle against the coronavirus. Xi made the remarks during a meeting at the Great Hall of the People-the seat of the Legislative Sino Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Sen, the first foreign leader to visit China after the emergence of the health crisis.\nChina will continue to maintain a \"transparent and open attitude to boost cooperation with all countries and thus combat disease and preserve together regional and global health,\" said the Chinese president. However, the transparency of Chinese management has been questioned: the respected business magazine Caijing China denounced last weekend manipulating figures in an article entitled Outside the statistics, then censored by Chinese authorities.\nPresident of the Bank European Central Christine Lagarde reiterated on Thursday in the European Parliament that there are \"signs of recovery\" of the eurozone economy, but has also recognized that the \"uncertainty\" about the possible impact of the coronavirus represents a new \"source of concern\". During his appearance before the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Lagarde said that some leading indicators are now \"slightly more optimistic\". He also stressed on the positive side, that trade tensions between China and the United States are declining.\n\"However, other risks are persisting or, as uncertainty about the impact of the coronavirus, are a source of renewed concern,\" said ha. Lagarde has said that is still \"uncertain\" the impact the outbreak will have on the Chinese economy and globally. \"We must be careful, be vigilant and be patient,\" has recommended, and pointed out that these pandemics \"tend to affect and, once contained, the economy is growing again.\" \"It is clearly what happened with SARS a few years ago,\" recalled.\nThe organizers of the Olympic Games of Tokyo have created a task force to coordinate with health authorities responding to the coronavirus, Toshiro Muto chaired by, head of the organizing committee of Tokyo 2020. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Thursday that there will be changes in the organization of the Olympic and Paralympic Games this summer as a result of the outbreak, reported the Kyodo news agency.\n\"With the conclusion of the Tokyo Games, I would like to make it clear that there have been no discussions or plans under consideration between the organizers and the International Olympic Committee since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an emergency\" says the head of the Japanese government, in an appearance before Parliament.",

Now, due to the coronavirus scare, Hong Kong has declared a month-long vacation. Gujarati traders having offices there are coming back to India,\" he said.\nIf the situation does not improve, it will have a huge impact on the Surat diamond industry, which polishes 99 per cent of all rough diamonds imported in the country, he said.\n\"The Surat diamond industry is staring at a loss of around Rs 8,000 crore for February and March,\" he added.\nAnother industry expert and diamond merchant Pravin Nanavati said there was a possibility of cancellation of an international jewellery exhibition in Hong Kong, to be held next month, due to the coronavirus scare, which would hit also the jewellery business in Surat.\n\"Polished diamonds and jewellery made in Surat reach across the world through Hong Kong only. Now, due to vacations there, our business is totally closed. Traders are also returning to India,\" he said.\nIf the situation does not improve, the Surat diamond trade losses may run into \"several thousand crores\", he said.\n\"We have been informed that the international exhibition in Hong Kong may be put off due to the coronavirus scare.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Coronavirus is a global scare now. There are no signs yet that the outbreak of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has been contained in Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic in China.\nThe fact that the administration has been selective in providing information to international agencies and media -- despite Chinese President Xi Jinping's public statement of keeping the fight against coronavirus outbreak a transparent affair - misinformation has taken the centre-stage on social media.\nMany conspiracy theories are doing rounds on Facebook, Twitter WhatsApp and their Chinese parallels.\nScientific magazine Nature has quoted international health workers as saying that the case-report data that are being released by the Chinese authorities are incomplete. Researchers are struggling to accurately model the outbreak and predict how it might unfold.\nThis has given a field day to misinformation - due to lack of credible information - and conspiracy theories attributing the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak to leakage of biological weapon and what Chinese people eat.\nA LEAKAGE OF BIO-WEAPON\nThis could be a case of fear-mongering at a time when health authorities around the world are on tenterhooks over the outbreak of coronavirus infection spreading from Hubei province of China.\nThat \"mystery\" lab is the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Wuhan is the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. The former Israeli spy has been identified in the reports as an expert in virology (study of viruses) and claims that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had been engaged in development of secret biological weapon for Chinese military.\nHowever, no health agency has backed their claim, which continued to gain traction from the fact that the authorities have pinpointed the source of Novel coronavirus -- from animals to humans - in a fish and animal market some 25-30 km from the virology lab\n.\nIt was in this fish and animal market that the coronavirus is believed to have infected humans first in early December. But alarm bells started ringing only on January 20, when 14 health workers treating pneumonia patients were reported ill. This was the first instance when human-to-human infection of coronavirus was confirmed in the current outbreak.\nESPIONAGE WITH CANADA CONNECTION\nAnother widely circulated theory of the coronavirus outbreak emerges from the sacking of two Chinese scientist couple working with the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg, Canada.\nThey along with their students had been sacked last year and escorted out of the building of the Winnipeg lab for suspected policy breach.\nNow, many social media influencers are claiming that the Chinese scientists had sent coronavirus to Wuhan lab, the only Level-4 lab in China, last year.\nThe coronavirus escaped the Wuhan lab, it is being claimed, largely because the Chinese scientists lacked expertise in dealing with this particular virus, which is highly mutable strand of RNA (ribonucleic acid, which is protein with genetic properties).\nPHARMA CONSPIRACY\nConspiracy theorists called it a planned outbreak for the gain of pharma companies involved with coronavirus vaccination. They linked it with Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is said to have funded both the Pirbright Institute and vaccine development.\nBAT SOUP\nOne video clip and a screengrab of it showing a woman eating bat are being circulated with claims that the current strand of coronavirus has reached humans due to the eating habits of the Chinese people.\nThe woman is heard saying in the video that the cooked bat tastes like chicken meat. Some factchekers have traced the video to a Palau in western Pacific Ocean, and dated some time in 2016. The video is completely unrelated to Wuhan coronavirus outbreak\n.\nThe fact that the authorities identified an animal market as the source of coronavirus outbreak and that bats could be a possible origin point have made people believe in misinformation coming with the old video.\nBIGGER THAN CHINESE PROJECTION\nThis is about 15 times more the figure of infected people put out by the Chinese government. According to official data, over 6,000 people have contracted the coronavirus infection and close to 130 deaths so far.\nThe video is said to be recorded by a nurse working in a Wuhan hospital. She is wearing a protective mask and does not identify herself as a health worker in the video, whose English translation is getting much traction on social media.\nThe authenticity of the video remains unverified mainly due to complete lockdown of Wuhan city and Hubei province of China.\nBut for the claim about the number of coronavirus infected people to be true, the R0 or R-naught need to be many times higher than what the World Health Organisation (WHO) said last week.\nR0 refers to the number of people that the virus tends to infect from an already infected person.\nThe WHO said the current corornavirus has an estimated R0 of 1.4 to 2.5. For 90,000 people to have been infected since the outbreak of coronavirus, R0 should be around 14-15.\n",

He said using breathalysers \"in the current scenario is highly unhygienic\", presenting a risk to the lives of both commuters and police officers.\nBengaluru authorities have been asked to temporarily stop using the machines, and traffic police in Chennai, too, worry that infected breathalysers pose a threat to their safety, according to recent newspaper reports.\nWHAT EXPERTS SAY\nBreathalysers should be used with aseptic (contamination-preventing) precautions and disposable mouthpieces, said Pradeep Awate, a doctor and Maharashtra state surveillance officer.\n\"Used mouthpieces should be disposed with all aseptic precautions,\" he said.\nAwate pointed out there there were other airborne diseases, too, such as tuberculosis and swine flu.\n\"So we should not ask for a ban on breath analysers, but we should insist on their appropriate use, taking into consideration such airborne/droplet infections.\"\nOther experts, who spoke to the news agency IANS, outlined similar precautions. Take a look.\n\"Why should the police end using breathalysers?,\" asked Atul Kaker, a senior consultant at Delhi's Sir Gangaram Hospital. He, too, advised the use of disposable machines.\n\"It's important for finding drunk drivers,\" he said\n. \"You can't ask for ending its use.\"\nAll three confirmed coronavirus cases in India have been detected in Kerala, which has declared a \"state calamity\".\nSo far, deaths outside China have been reported in Hong Kong and The Phillipines.\nInputs from IANS\n",

He was 34.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS eased 0.5 per cent on Friday as the lingering anxiety over the virus outbreak tempered the mood, though it is still up 3.2 per cent for the week.\nJapan's Nikkei .N225 and Korea's Kospi .KS11 headed lower in morning trade, but are on track for their best week of the year after earlier rises.\nThe rally in global stocks since Monday's wipeout of Chinese equities, and the selldown in bonds, was underpinned by China's sweeping efforts to contain the spread of the virus.\nBeijing has pumped billions of dollars into the money market to stabilize market confidence and support its faltering economy. Thursday's news of Chinese tariff cuts on some US goods had also fired up riskier assets.\nBut with the death toll rising, cities shut off, flights canceled and factories closed, global supply chains are in disarray and fears of a pandemic remain. Chinese stocks also sit well below.\n\"The rate of infection is not slowing,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief markets strategist at brokerage CMC Markets in Sydney.\n\"I'm a little surprised at the way European and US investors have shrugged this off. I think the reaction in the Asia-Pacific region is much more reasonable. There is real uncertainty,\" he said.\nIn morning trade a slide in the safe-haven yen paused, leaving the currency sitting by a two-week low at 109\n.98 per dollar and poised for its worst weekly loss since last October.\nGains in the Australian dollar AUD=D3, a liquid proxy for China because of the heavy exposure of Australian exports, were likewise halted. It is on track for its first weekly rise this year. Gold hovered at $1,565.76 per ounce XAU=.\nChinese goods trade figures due during the morning will be closely watched for an early glimpse of how the virus, and the harsh measures to contain it, are affecting the flow of goods.\nCOMMODS CAUTIOUS\nMuch is unknown about the coronavirus, including its lethality and transmission routes. The World Health Organization has said it is too early to call a peak in the outbreak.\nYet China's aggressive response, dubbed a \"people's war for epidemic prevention\" by President Xi Jinping, appears to have inspired confidence.\nOvernight, bonds were sold and markets rallied from Frankfurt to New York. U.S. stocks gained for a fourth straight session and Wall Street's main indexes hit record highs. The S&P 500 .SPX rose 0.3 per cent.\nOwing to much greater exposure to Chinese demand and less access to the benefits of monetary stimulus, commodity prices have been much more sensitive to conditions on the ground.\nOil and metal prices fell hard as the coronavirus outbreak gained pace and have been slow to recover.\nU.S. crude CLc1 was firm on Friday at 51.37 per barrel, but is flat for the week and remains 13 per cent below its Jan. 21 level. Brent prices settled at $55.12 per barrel.\nA rally in copper - often seen as a barometer of global economic health because of its wide industrial use - ran out of steam on Thursday and closed flat in London at $5,735-a-tonne CMCU3.\n\"We think that demand could come back strongly as opposed to gradually in Q2 2020,\" said Commonwealth Bank commodities analyst Vivek Dhar.\n\"But the risk in the near term is that provinces take longer to return to work in order to contain the spread of the virus.\"\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - China’s domestic coal mines are struggling to ramp up production in the face of the ongoing coronavirus epidemic. That’s a situation that may seem positive for seaborne exporters, but in reality it may be challenging for miners to take advantage.\nWhile there may be increased demand for imported coal in China in coming weeks, the problem for major exporters such as Indonesia, Australia and the United States is going to be one of logistics.\nThe coronavirus is starting to have an impact on supply chains and will make it more challenging for shippers to find vessels to go to China. And even if exporters do get their goods to Chinese ports, they will likely face headaches in unloading cargoes and transporting them from docks to end-users.\nBy Thursday, the country’s health authority said, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan had reached 563, with more than 28,000 others infected.\nWhile the fatalities and infections draw headlines, the impact of the virus is starting to cascade through China’s economy - as well as businesses in countries that trade heavily with the world’s largest consumer of commodities.\nThe challenge of shipping coal to China was illustrated by the Australian government’s decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on vessels leaving mainland China after Feb. 1.\nThis means such vessels will face delays upon reaching Australian ports, as the sailing time between China and both the east and west coasts of Australia is generally less than 14 days.\nVessel queues outside Australian coal ports are already lengthening. Argus Media reported on Feb. 4 that the number of ships waiting outside Newcastle, the world’s largest coal export harbor, was at an 18-month high of 20 vessels\n.\nThere are some other factors that may be contributing to longer vessel waiting times, such as weather and port and rail maintenance, but the overall trend is clear: Shipments to, as well as from, China are becoming more complicated to arrange.\nOne thing that is working in exporters’ favor is a sharp decline in shipping rates. The rate to ship coal from Newcastle to China dropped to $5.87 a tonne on Wednesday, the lowest in almost four years and about a third of the $16.49 peak reached in September last year.\nAt these freight prices, shipping companies will be losing money on every voyage, while they are also facing higher costs from the mandatory switch to cleaner fuels that kicked in last month as part of a change in global shipping regulations known as IMO2020.\nWhile the cost of shipping may be depressed, the main challenge will be securing vessels with owners prepared to send them to China.\nCertainly, Asian seaborne coal prices have yet to show any meaningful spike from China’s domestic coal woes.\nThe price of 6,000 kilocalorie per kilogram (kcal/kg) coal at Newcastle, as assessed by brokers Tullett Prebon climbed to $69.35 a tonne on Thursday, up from a recent low of $66.30 on Feb. 3, but still below the high so far this year of $72 on Jan. 13.\nThe price of lower-quality 4,200 kcal/kg coal from Indonesia has fared better, with the weekly Argus index rising to a six-month high of $35.48 a tonne in the week ended Jan. 31.\nThe rise in the Indonesian coal price follows similar gains in domestic prices in China, with thermal coal at Qinhuangdao, as assessed by SteelHome ending at 563 yuan ($80.66) on Wednesday, down slightly from 564 yuan on Feb. 4, which was the highest in three months.\nThe coal market appears to be reacting with caution to the coronavirus, with still considerable uncertainty over how much domestic output has been lost, what transport bottlenecks exist currently in China and whether more imported coal will be needed\n. Even if it is, can it get there efficiently?\nWhat is becoming clearer is that the efforts to contain the virus by limiting economic activity in China is going to have multiple flow-on effects through commodity supply chains.\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n",

Test results on around 171 people from the cruise ship are still pending. The 10 new cases included four Japanese, two Americans, two Canadians, one person from New Zealand and one from Taiwan.\nCarnival’s Diamond Princess was caught up in the global coronavirus epidemic after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man tested positive for the virus after disembarking late last month. The ship arrived in Yokohama on Monday after a 14-day round trip.\nClyde and Renee Smith, a U.S. couple who are both 80 and on the cruise with two adult grandsons, said they were on a bus trip with the man in Kagoshima, southern Japan, but both tested negative for the virus.\nThey were enduring their second day in a stateroom that, as Renee told Reuters by phone from the ship, “is tiny, we don’t have a window, there are four of us - and only one chair.”\nThey’ve spent time reading and watching movies, including “Crazy Rich Asians” and “Aquaman.” Grandson Sawyer Smith, 25, a workout devotee, does crunches since he can’t visit the gym.\n“It’s not really to the point where we’re getting stir-crazy, if they keep us in the rooms for four to five days it might be a little different,” Sawyer said.\nOthers, though, were starting to feel confined\n.\nOne 43-year-old Hong Kong resident, also in a windowless room, said they had received food, toilet paper and games and art supplies for their child.\nBut it was sunlight they wanted, he said.\n“Wondering though when we can step outside the room, if at all, for sunlight,” the man, who declined to be named, told Reuters, adding he hadn’t been in direct sunlight since Tuesday.\n“I got a peek of it when the opposite room opened their door to receive breakfast, as that room has a balcony. The sky looked blue.”\nOther passengers said food delivery to the rooms was slow.\n“Of course, our greatest worry is that we have been infected,” said Gay Courter, a 75-year-old U.S. novelist.\n“We are hopeful that the U.S. government will be sending transport for the Americans on board it’s better for us to travel while healthy and also if we get sick to be treated in American hospitals.”\nConcern has also spread to ports the ship visited along the way, including Naha on Japan’s tropical Okinawa island and Taipei in Taiwan, where passengers went on day trips.\nA health official in Naha said they were trying to trace the path of the infected passengers, while Taipei’s National Palace Museum disinfected its exhibition rooms and Taiwan banned all cruise ships from making port.\nJapan is making arrangements to send a fourth chartered plane to Wuhan to pick up around 200 people on Thursday night, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. These are likely to include Chinese spouses as well as Japanese.\nThe virus death toll in mainland China hit 563 on Thursday, with almost 3,000 new cases reported.\nChina’s National Health Commission said another 3,694 coronavirus cases were reported throughout the country on Feb. 5, bringing the total to 28,018.\nNearly 260 cases have been reported in 31 other countries and regions outside mainland China, according to a Reuters tally based on official statements from the authorities involved\n.

At the same time, it expressed confidence in the ability of China to control the epidemic. With more and more cases in China showing the spread of the epidemic, more and more countries are affected, including Russia and other multinational governments taking measures to close the border, the United States, the United Kingdom and France and other airlines have taken grounded flights, and some countries have begun to withdraw overseas Chinese.\nA Agence France-Presse reporter saw a white haired man wearing a mask and a more than 60 year old man who appeared to be on the street in Wuhan on January 30th. He suddenly fell dead and was holding a shopping bag. Wuhan used to be crowded with people. Now there are few pedestrians on the street. No one dares to approach the man who died on the side of the road.\nMedical staff and some onlookers were worried, and the atmosphere in the whole city of Wuhan was scared. The reporter reported that the Sixth Hospital of Wuhan is one of the main medical centers for the treatment of pneumonia patients in Wuhan. It is full of people waiting for examination.\nThe Chinese authorities have taken unprecedented measures to block the city, blocking roads and flights, and trying to stop the spread of the virus.\nFrench historian and Chinese expert Francois gudeming, now an Asia consultant at the University of Montaigne in France, said it was true that the Chinese government delayed acknowledging the outbreak and drew criticism. It is true that the Chinese government has not invested enough in public health, such as the lack of hospitals and freelance doctors. In the second stage, the Chinese government took urgent measures. Although it made life inconvenient for the local people, there was no other way. The Chinese government has taken relatively strict measures to control the spread of the epidemic to other countries.\nFor criticizing the lack of transparency of the Chinese government in dealing with the crisis, Gu Deming believes that it is true that the initial stage of the outbreak was like this. Although the central government was not completely transparent in dealing with the epidemic since January 20, especially in how to find the origin of the virus, there was little information from the outside world. At present, the Chinese government has not cooperated with the outside world, but it has improved compared with the outbreak of SARS in 2003 Time has improved. We can see some English articles published by Chinese criticizing the government's slow action. In addition, we can use wechat to report local officials' concealment of the epidemic, showing some changes.\nThe current situation is that China's new coronavirus can be transmitted to humans rapidly, and the number of cases is faster than that of 2003 SARS virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome.\n。\nBut the initial symptoms of SARS are high fever and dry cough, which lead to dyspnea. In a few days, severe patients need artificial oxygen to survive. The latent period of the new coronavirus is almost asymptomatic.\nWuhan is suffering from severe pneumonia. The first French evacuation plane from Wuhan arrived at the southern isolation resort in France on Friday, and the second French evacuation plane arrived at home on Sunday.\nGerman Foreign Minister Maas said the German government on Friday sent a military aircraft to Wuhan, China, to withdraw more than 100 German citizens from the area hit by the virus, while providing the Chinese government with short supplies such as masks and 10000 sets of protective clothing.\n",

After that, I also suspected to be infected with Wuhan pneumonia and was admitted to the intensive care unit. The source said that many of the eight revelers were doctors, belonging to different groups of doctors.\nAccording to the report, the wechat account beiqingshenyi interviewed the Wuhan doctor. Although the interview article has been deleted, it has been copied and transmitted by other netizens. In addition to understanding the process of the whistler finding cases, the report also revealed the attitude of the Chinese authorities to deal with the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan at the first time.\nAccording to the doctor, it was learned from colleagues at that time that the Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission also issued a red headed document to notify the South China seafood market of unexplained cases of pneumonia. He just wanted to tell other doctors on the front line that they should take protective measures. He didn't expect the screenshot to be posted on the Internet. The doctor said that the next day he was called by the hospital's superior to ask questions such as the source of the information, and then he was called to the supervision department of the hospital for many times, repeatedly asking him if he knew the error of his rumor, and finally asked him to write a self-examination report. On January 3rd, the local public security informed him to sign a \"reprimand\", warning him to \"terminate the illegal act at this time\", and the hospital asked him not to spread such information outside.\nThe report said that the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan continued, and the doctor began to treat patients. After January 10, he had cough and fever symptoms. After a CT scan, he found that he had lung lesions and was suspected to have Wuhan pneumonia. However, the nucleic acid test results have not yet come out, so it is impossible to confirm the case completely. With the aggravation of the disease, the doctor was transferred to the intensive care unit on the 24th, and his parents who came to take care of him also suffered from fever, vomiting and other symptoms, which were suspected of being infected. At present, two people are in hospital for treatment, receiving relevant tests.\nBecause of the spread of pneumonia in Wuhan around the world, the public was angry at the first eight people who were fined by the police.

        "news_content_translate_en": "But what did China do? Hua Chunying said that China, in a responsible manner, \"has informed the US of the epidemic information and prevention and control measures 30 times since January 3. The Centers for Disease Control and prevention of the two countries have communicated with each other for many times on the epidemic situation.\nWhat caused netizens' outrage was that the pneumonia in Wuhan became more and more severe, which caused a national panic. The key problem was that the public knew too late. At the beginning, the authorities did not report the epidemic to the society in time, instead, they suppressed eight doctors who dared to speak, and ordered some doctors to sign documents such as letters of repentance.\nOn Monday, for the first time, many Chinese heard from a spokesman of the Chinese foreign ministry. Since January 3, when the vast majority of Chinese people were still in the dark, China has begun to report the epidemic information to the United States, a total of 30 times. Generally speaking, Chinese people know about the situation, about after academician Zhong Nanshan revealed the message of Wuhan pneumonia on January 20. But the leaders of Hubei and Wuhan authorities were still in \"group worship\" on January 21 to watch art performances. Wuhan people and even the whole of China were not frightened until Wuhan was closed on the 23rd. That is to say, until the outbreak in Wuhan completely out of control!\nAt present, it is recognized that the earliest time to detect the epidemic is December 8. Even if the Beijing authorities can report the epidemic to the American public on January 3, the epidemic will not spread to the later stage. Wuhan city will not suddenly announce the closure of the city late on the 23rd night, which is the result of everyone's surprise and panic.\nSome netizens said: \"I told the Americans on January 3, but I didn't tell us the people of Hubei. I can't believe it if it's not officially announced by myself.\".\nAnother netizen commented: the Chinese official said that since the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, 30 times of China's epidemic situation had been reported to the U.S., \"people's wrath! While catching the doctors who published the true information of the virus, they kept reporting to the U.S. while not telling the truth! They kept hiding the key points of the people for 20 days. What kind of regime is this? They regard the people as grass mustard and ruminant dogs!\"\nChen Qiushi, a citizen journalist, commented: has the foreign ministry missed the point? I know everything from top to bottom, but I have to hide the Chinese people. How can I hate them to do this\n。\nCompared with Wuhan pneumonia, influenza is said to be ignorant\nA spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry criticized the United States for not helping China in real terms. It cited the example of the US influenza to compare with the new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosed in China. It said that \"the 2019-2020 influenza season in the United States has infected 19 million people and at least ten thousand people have died.\"\nBut experts believe that the flu can not be compared with Wuhan pneumonia or SARS at all. First, the case fatality rate is not in an order of magnitude. The case fatality rate of SARS is 10%, and that of Wuhan pneumonia is 3%. However, according to the statement that more than 10 million people in the United States are infected with influenza and nearly 10000 people died, the case fatality rate is only 0.05%. The severity varies, and many flu strains have vaccines.\nHua Chunying is here to talk about the U.S. flu, deliberately ignoring the situation in China. In fact, according to the report of the lancet quoted by the Southern Metropolis Daily on September 21 last year, 88000 people die of influenza every year in China, far more than the official data.\nChina treats us and Russia differently\nHua Chunying's purpose in taking this example is to show that the US side is not enough. According to Hua Chunying's statement, China's accusation against the United States is mainly that the United States \"made a special response to the Chinese epidemic and took excessive measures, which obviously ran counter to the WHO recommendations\".\nTo prevent the outbreak, Russia, which is close to China, recently blocked the 4250 km border between Russia and China, cut off the railway lines between the two countries, restricted flights, restricted Chinese tourists and suspended the issuance of visas to Chinese workers. What's more, Russian Prime Minister announced on Monday that he would take severe measures to deport Russian patients infected with the new coronavirus, which is also considered to be aimed at the Chinese.\nInternet users commented on Russia's move that \"only the powerful people with centralized power can take such anti humanitarian measures to seal up cities and expel foreigners\".\nBut China does not say a word about this extreme measure.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "In just a few days, Wuhan new coronavirus continues to show the characteristics of \"God infection\", which can be described as \"God does not know the ghost\" to let people \"win\". Ma Xiaowei, director of China's National Health Commission, said on Sunday that the virus was also contagious in its incubation period, according to observations. Some patients may have transmitted their own virus to others before the onset of the disease. Some \"Wuhan pneumonia\" patients have normal body temperature in the early stage, many mild cases and recessive infection. These \"walking infectious sources\" make the prevention and control more difficult. Some influenza patients have no symptoms during the incubation period, but they have been able to infect. At this point, Wuhan new coronavirus is similar to influenza virus.\nIt is reported that there was a confirmed case in Anyang, Henan Province. Five of them were relatives, but none of them had traveled or lived in Wuhan. Three of them had contact with a female family member who came back from Wuhan. They were her father and two aunts, respectively. However, the woman has not had any symptoms of new pneumonia so far. The case shows that during the incubation period before the infected person has any symptoms, it is possible to transmit the virus to others.\nIn addition, the infection of new coronavirus caused by international communication is also proving the great infectious force of this virus. The first 4 confirmed infections in Japan were tourists from Wuhan, but one of the 2 new coronavirus infections found in Japan was a bus driver living in Nara County, who was more than 60 years old. He had no experience of visiting China. But in January, he traveled 2 times from Wuhan.\nThe German Ministry of health in Bavaria held a press conference at 28 a.m. on 10 January 27th to elaborate on the first case of a new coronavirus confirmed in Germany on Monday night. The German patient, a 33 year old man, was infected at a company training meeting last week when she had contact with a Chinese female colleague. It was later found that the Chinese female colleague, although from Shanghai, had just met her parents in Wuhan before coming to Germany. If a few days of training contact can lead to infection, the man recently had close contact with at least 40 people, including children in kindergarten. These people are advised to stay at home for continuous observation and examination\n。\nLi Xingwang, chief expert of the infectious diseases diagnosis and research center of Ditan hospital in Beijing, said at a press conference held on the morning of the 28th of the national health and Health Commission of China that at present some asymptomatic but nucleic acid positive infected people have been observed, and some patients have no obvious fever, occasional dry cough or weakness. According to the law of infectious diseases, these patients also have a certain transmission power Therefore, it brings certain difficulties and complexity to the prevention and control work.\nAs asymptomatic infections are mainly found in \"close contacts\", once they are found, they should be isolated at home and observed in medicine according to the requirements. They can not move freely in public places to ensure the control of infectious sources.\nThe spread of the new coronavirus in Wuhan shows that it not only has the ability of continuous human to human transmission, but also can sometimes come and go without trace. Researchers at Imperial College London released a report on Saturday estimating that as of January 18, an average of 2.6 people had been infected with each case of Wuhan pneumonia. This means that the authorities must block more than 60% of the transmission in order to effectively control the epidemic.\nBased on the total number of international tourists and overseas case reports from Wuhan, the researchers also estimated that there were 4000 new coronavirus cases in Wuhan as of August 18. Compared with the official figure of 4515 newly confirmed cases in China on the 28th, this is not high.\nOnly when the infection rate drops below 1, the number of new cases will gradually decrease and eventually the epidemic will be calmed down, the report said. Given that the estimated infection rate of these viruses is still as high as 2.6, it is unclear whether the \"Wuhan pneumonia\" epidemic can be controlled in China, which will depend on the effectiveness of the prevention and control measures taken in Wuhan and other regions of China.\nIn addition to 8 cases in Taiwan, 69 of the total international diagnoses of the new coronavirus have been identified in 16 countries. The newly added countries are Kampuchea, Sri Lanka and Germany. There were 14 cases in Thailand, 8 in Hong Kong, 7 in Macao, 5 in the United States, 5 in Australia, 5 in Singapore, 4 in Malaysia, 6 in Japan, 4 in Korea, 3 in France, 2 in Vietnam, 2 in Canada, 1 in Nepal, 1 in Cambodia, 1 in Sri Lanka and 1 in Germany.\nThe more optimistic analysis shows that Wuhan new coronavirus is much faster than SARS virus in terms of its transmission speed and adaptability to human body, but this may mean that it may also disappear quickly\n。\nHowever, pessimistic international studies suggest that \"Wuhan pneumonia\" cases may still increase exponentially in the near future. Researchers at Lancaster University in the UK estimate that if the epidemic continues in Wuhan, by February 4, there will be about 190000 cases in Wuhan alone, and such a pattern of infection will be established in other cities in China, and the virus's export abroad will become more frequent.\nReports from Wuhan hospital show that: the hospital is still overcrowded, there are diseases can not be diagnosed, after diagnosis can not be isolated and hospitalized treatment, all kinds of complaints are found in the network and media. Although the number of patients per day has increased dramatically and climbed up, many people still question that the number of outbreaks in China is far lower than the actual number.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "在短短几天中，武汉新冠病毒不断显现“神传染”的特性，可谓“神不知鬼不觉”地让人“中招”。中国国家卫健委主任马晓伟上周日指出，从观察情况来看，这类病毒在潜伏期也具有传染性。一些患者在发病之前可能就已经把自身携带的病毒传染给了他人。部分“武汉肺炎”患者早期体温正常，轻症病例较多，存在隐性感染者，这些“行走的传染源”让防控难度陡增。一些流感患者在病毒潜伏期没有出现症状，却已经具备了传染能力。在这一点上，武汉新冠病毒与流感病毒类似。\n据报道：在河南安阳出现一例确诊病例，其中5人是亲属关系，但均无到武汉旅行和居住过，其中3人曾与从武汉回来的一位女性家人接触，他们分别是该女子的父亲和2个姑姑，但该女子至今却没有出现任何新型肺炎的症状。该病例说明：在被感染者尚未出现任何症状之前的潜伏期内，却有可能把自身病毒传染给他人。\n此外，国际间交流引发的新型冠状病毒传染病例也在证明这一病毒的巨大传染力。日本最早确认的4人感染，均是来自武汉的游客，但日本国内新发现的2例新型冠状病毒感染者之一是居住在奈良县的大巴司机，60多岁，并没有访问中国的经历，但在1月份2次搭载了从武汉市来的旅行团。\n德国巴伐利亚州卫生部28日上午10点举行新闻发布会，详细说明周一（1月27日）晚间确认的德国首例新型冠状病毒病例。该德国病患为33岁男子，在上周的一次公司培训会议上，与一名中国女同事有接触而被感染。后被查出：这名中国女同事虽然来自上海，但在来德国前刚与住在武汉的父母见过面。如果说几天的培训接触会发生感染，这位男子最近至少与40多人有过密切接触，包括上幼儿园的孩子。这些人都被建议留在家里持续观察并进行检查。\n中国国家卫生健康委员会28日上午召开记者会，北京地坛医院感染性疾病诊疗与研究中心首席专家李兴旺表示，目前观察到一些没有症状、但核酸检测为阳性的感染者，还有一些病人发烧不明显，偶尔乾咳或无力；从传染病规律来说，这些病人也具有一定的传播力，因此对防控工作带来一定的困难和複杂性。\n由于无症状感染者主要是在“密切接触者”中发现的，所以一旦被发现，都应按要求进行居家隔离和医学观察，不能随意到公共场所自由活动，保证对传染源的控制。\n新冠病毒在武汉的疫情传播程度表明，它不仅具备了持续人传人的能力，而且有时会来去无踪。关于其传染能力，英国帝国理工学院(Imperial College London)的研究人员上周六发布报告估计，截至1月18日，每个“武汉肺炎”病例平均传染了2.6个人。这意味着，当局要阻断六成以上的传染才能有效地控制疫情。\n基于从武汉出发的国际旅客总量和境外病例报告，这些研究人员还估算，截至18日，武汉共有4000例新冠病毒病例。这与28日中国新确诊病例4515例的官方数字相比，只低不高。\n报告说，只有传染率降至1以下时，新病例的数量才会逐渐减少，最终得以平息疫情。鉴于这类病毒传染率的估算值日前仍然高达2.6，研究人员目前尚不清楚“武汉肺炎”疫情能否在中国得到控制，这将取决于武汉和中国其他地区采取的防控措施的有效性。\n除了台湾8例以外，新型冠状病毒的国际病患累计已经有69例确诊，分布于16个国家，新增国家为柬埔寨、斯里兰卡及德国。分别为泰国14例、香港8例、澳门7例、美国5例、澳洲5例、新加坡5例、马来西亚4例、日本6例、韩国4例、法国3例、越南2例、加拿大2例、尼泊尔1例、柬埔寨1例、斯里兰卡1例及德国1例。\n较乐观的分析认为：从武汉新冠病毒的传播速度以及对人体的适应能力来看，它要比非典病毒快很多，但这可能意味着它可能消失得也快。\n不过，悲观的国际研究认为：“武汉肺炎”病例仍然可能会在近期呈指数增长。英国兰卡斯特大学(Lancaster University)的研究人员估算，如果疫情在武汉持续不减的话，到2月4日，仅在武汉当地就会出现19万左右的病例，并且这样的传染规律也会在中国其他城市建立起来，而病毒的境外输出也会变得更加频繁。\n来自武汉医院的报道显示：医院仍然人满为患，有病得不到诊断，诊断后得不到隔离和住院治疗，种种怨言载道见于网络和媒体。虽然每天的病人数字大幅增加和向上爬坡已惊心动魄，但多方仍质疑中国的疫情数字远远低于实际数字。\n\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "On February 6, the World Health Organization quoted Mike Ryan, executive director of emergency health planning, as saying that he deeply mourned the death of Dr. Li Wenliang. On the night of the same day, who issued another tweets, pointing out that \"on the day of the media briefing on the new coronavirus, Mike Ruian was asked about the death of Dr. Li Wenliang, and Mike Ruian expressed his grief on the news\" and stressed that \"who does not have information about the situation of Li Wenliang.\" Below this tweet, a large number of netizens replied. The picture of Tan Desai, director general of the World Health Organization, blinded by the five-star red flag, is a satirical picture of who becoming a subsidiary of Wuhan government.\nOn various social media in China, people sent Dr. Li a thousand miles away: This 34 year old young man, who is concerned about digital, funny, tourism and the United States, was forced to quit his life early under the prosperous age of a harmonious and beautiful country.\nOn the social media in China, people sent away thousands of miles; in France's social media, some people mourned the death of Dr. Lee, and someone replied, \"he is not dead, he was stolen alive\"; people stopped joking about the \"Chinese virus\", stopped discussing whether to call the new coronavirus a Chinese virus, or the Wuhan virus belongs to racial discrimination, and stopped discussing the engraving of China. Board impression, stop satirizing, massive comments are mourning the \"hero of China\", \"Whistler of the world epidemic\", \"brave doctor\", \"young brave martyr\", \"white clothes daring to open the dark curtain\". The distrust of China has gradually been replaced by the support for the Chinese people and the admiration for the courage of young Chinese doctors. Freedom of information. They want the Chinese to have it.\nLi Wenliang, an ophthalmologist in Wuhan Central Hospital, also has a warning letter from the Municipal Public Security Bureau on his microblog, which shows that the Public Security Bureau once asked Li Wenliang: \"the public security organ hopes that you can actively cooperate with the work and follow the advice of the police, so as to stop the illegal act, can you do it?\"? Li Wenliang replied, \"yes.\". And covered with a red handprint. The Public Security Bureau continued to ask: \"we hope you calm down and reflect on yourself, and solemnly warn you that if you persist in your own opinions, do not want to repent, and continue to carry out illegal activities, you will be punished by the law!\"! Do you understand? Li Wenliang replied, \"I understand.\". And covered it with a red fingerprint\n。\nIf the positive index of high confidence of SARS coronavirus was found in the patient's test report, so as to remind people to pay attention to the protection, the announcement said that the confirmation of 7 cases of SARS was a rumor, and the dissemination of untrue information was illegal, then the production capacity of masks in Hubei Province announced by Wang Xiaodong, the governor of Hubei Province, first changed from 10.8 billion to 1.8 billion, and then changed to 1.08 million, is it a rumor? Is it a rumor that the outbreak promised the people at the first time that \"the epidemic can be prevented and controlled\"? Wuhan Fengcheng promises to law-abiding people who choose not to flee overnight and trust the government that they can \"control the epidemic\". Is it a \"rumor\" that the world is miserable today?\nIf Li Wenliang's death is being \"used and turned into a public opinion debate\" to incite people to \"hate and attack the government and be disappointed in the national social system\", and people should \"believe in the party, the country and the government\", then there is no need to incite. The people who have been full of trust in this epidemic are already sacrificing. It is true that \"if you have light, China will not be dark\". But Dr. Li Wenliang, who lights up the epidemic situation for people, died after \"death and resurrection and resurrection\".\nWho is chosen to play the role of \"cost\", who is forced to be the victim, who sacrifices, for the prevention and control of the epidemic, or for the control of public opinion? It is more extreme to screen the true information, filter the false information, and deal with the doubts and reminders of the public. If it involves legal punishment for individuals, especially if such punishment is lack of supervision and balance due to the original framework of power representatives, it is more extreme than throwing people into the ocean of true and false information to screen on their own, because people may be willing to refer to the false information without credentials It's officially called true. It's believed that there is a possibility of false.\n",

If the new coronavirus epidemic continues, it will threaten the global industrial chain. Whether it is the textile industry, automobile industry, or electronic industry, many industries relying on Chinese manufacturing are facing threats. The related impact is not limited to Wuhan, most parts of China are at a standstill. In the economic capital, Shanghai, the Spring Festival holiday has been extended to next Sunday, and Chongqing, with a population of 30 million, has taken the same step, one of the world's leading producers of laptops. In addition, factories in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong and other provinces have also been shut down until 9th of this month. The provinces and cities that announced the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday account for about half of China's GDP, analysts at the Oxford Economics said on Monday.\nThe newspaper also reported and analyzed the following cases in several other reports: the price of raw materials worldwide has dropped to the lowest level since 2016 due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus in China. Brazil, a big exporter of raw materials in South America, has been deeply affected by the outbreak. The epidemic will have a severe impact on the industrial value chain; Paris and London authorities continue to encourage expatriates to evacuate China; Southeast Asian countries are winged. The wing did not want to offend the Beijing government, and the new coronavirus pushed the research progress to the priority status again.\nHong Kong's mood in platoon\nThe reporter of Figaro in Beijing also published an article, reporting the death cases in Hong Kong, which aggravated the exclusion of Hong Kong people to the mainland. The report said: on Tuesday, a 39 year old Hongkong patient who had travelled to Wuhan and was infected with pneumonia in Wuhan died of sudden myocardial infarction in the hospital. This is the first case of a new coronavirus death in Hongkong, causing panic. Hong Kong, which has experienced the SARS crisis, is worried about being attacked by the new epidemic in the unfinished political crisis, further expanding the Anti China sentiment. After more than six months of fighting with Beijing, Hong Kong has called for a cut-off from the mainland and embarrassment for chief executive Lin Zhengyue. On Monday, doctors and nurses in Hong Kong launched a strike against the government's refusal to close all border control ports. Under pressure, the government announced on the same day an increase in the number of ports closed with the mainland.\nThe report points out that the fear of new coronavirus further aggravates the dislike of Hong Kong people on the mainland.\n。 From real estate prices to Xi Jinping's political control and more and more Chinese tourists' bad performance. Most Hong Kong people blame the mainland for their misfortune.\nDisadvantages of China's health system\nThe outbreak of a new coronavirus in December last year has challenged China's health system. China has the ability to make a strong response as soon as possible in times of crisis. The fact of two new hospitals in Wuhan is the best example. However, the epidemic also revealed the weakness of the whole medical system, which depends on public hospitals. Since the beginning of the epidemic, it has highlighted the shortage of medical staff and the shortage of patients; the treatment of patients mainly depends on the overcrowded public hospitals.\nIn the news report, \"cross newspaper\" raised the question of \"facing the new coronavirus and whether the world is over stressed\". Wuhan pneumonia has killed 425 people and infected more than 20000 people in China, according to experts in the newspaper. In other countries, however, communication is relatively limited. However, more and more countries cut off communication with China, which makes China feel more isolated. In fact, part of the reason for the panic has to do with China's opaque approach during the SARS epidemic in 2003.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The new coronavirus, commonly known as Wuhan pneumonia, continues to spread in China. Official statistics show that as of 21:30 hours in Beijing on Sunday, February 2, 2020, there were 14492 confirmed cases in China, 19544 suspected patients, 427 cured and 304 dead.\nAccording to our French correspondent in Beijing, the Wuhan pneumonia epidemic not only has a serious impact on China's health care, but also on the economy. The people's Bank of China announced that it would inject new vitality into the economy.\nAfter McDonald's, IKEA, Wal Mart, Starbucks, Pizza Hut and KFC, Apple announced the temporary closure of many of its outlets in China. According to the Caixin analysis, the new coronavirus lost nearly 130 billion euros in the service industry during the first week of the Chinese lunar calendar year.\nAccording to this French report, China's growth is at a new low in three decades. After an agreement with the us to suspend the costly trade war, we expect to revive the economy, but the new coronavirus has disrupted this deployment. The people's Bank of China announced today that it will inject the equivalent of 156 billion euros to support the economy.\nWuhan is an important industrial center in China\nWuhan is not only the center of this pneumonia epidemic, but also the center of China's industry, especially the automobile industry and electronic industry. Many factories have now decided to extend their annual holidays, and the employment rate is a matter of close concern in Beijing, fearing social unrest. However, it is hard to imagine that these measures are enough to revive consumption. Because of the virus, people stay at home, even some couriers rest, and going out becomes more complicated: taxi drivers are worried about carrying infected customers. The same is true in the industrial field. If the factories of masks and medical equipment are working hard, but in many enterprises, the workers have not yet returned to work. Tourism, which should have generated billions of dollars this season, is directly affected. China's economy, like the daily life of Chinese people, has been slowed down.\n",

On January 29, Tibetan officials announced the discovery of a suspected case, which was finally confirmed on January 30, the source said. At this point, all provinces and cities in China have found confirmed cases. Tibet, the last pure land, has been occupied for many days.\nSo far, the whole country is red! All this is due to a straightforward young man from Hubei Province.\nThe article said that on January 29, Tibet officially issued a circular. Zhang, 34 years old, male, from Suizhou City, Hubei Province, arrived at Lhasa city by train from Wuchang from January 22 to 24, and went to the designated medical institution of Tibet Autonomous Region on the evening of January 25 to see a doctor, receive admission and receive isolation treatment. In January 28th, the test was identified as a suspected case of a new coronavirus infection.\nThis is the first suspected case of a new coronavirus infection in Tibet. Tibetan officials announced on January 30 that a suspected case had been confirmed.\nOn January 30, the Tibetan government issued another circular. According to the latest diagnostic procedures of the national health and Health Committee on the first case of pneumonia caused by new coronavirus in various provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), as well as the diagnosis and treatment plan of the new coronavirus infection (trial version fourth), the first suspected case in Tibet autonomous region is Zhang Mou, the case sample is checked by the center for Disease Control and prevention of the autonomous region, and the laboratory of the China Center for Disease Control and prevention is rechecked. The first confirmed case of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus infection was confirmed according to the clinical manifestations and the consultation of the expert group of the autonomous region.\nAt present, the patient is being hospitalized in a designated medical institution, with stable vital signs and close contacts undergoing medical isolation observation. This is the first confirmed case of a new coronavirus infection in Tibet.\nOn January 30, the city of Lhasa took action, announcing an urgent search for passengers on the same train as the man, the source said.\nThe announcement showed more details: Zhang took the train from Wuhan Wuchang railway station at 23:00 p.m. on January 22, arrived in Xining, Qinghai Province on the evening of January 23, and transferred once\n。 As early as January 20, the epidemic broke out completely. By January 22, all news media and people on the Internet were discussing the epidemic. On January 23, Wuhan was closed! In the era when smart phones are so popular, people all over the country are talking about the epidemic in Hubei. This 34 year old may not know all this information???\nThe most questionable thing is that he arrived in Lhasa on the afternoon of the 24th. The next day, he took the initiative to go to the designated medical institution in Lhasa city to be hospitalized and receive isolation treatment! On the morning of January 29, due to the occurrence of this case, Tibet was forced to urgently announce the launch of level I response to major public health emergencies in the whole region!!!\nThe article said that the current epidemic situation is very serious. Tibet has been defending for many days and finally lost. The willfulness of the Hubei people not only affects the public health and safety of the whole Tibetan area, but also affects the whole country's people to find two trains for isolation. The cost is too high!\n",

But then the list of closed cities continued to grow, and the German media began to discuss whether this was a restriction on civil liberties. Wuhan's fierce pneumonia has gradually turned Germany into an enemy. Germany's top politicians demand that German health departments and hospitals be ready in time. German medical experts reassured the public through the media, saying that Germany has the ability to deal with new viruses, but also warned people not to be careless.\nGermany's Bildungsroman Bildungsroman reported Saturday that there was a suspected case in Berlin. A woman who came back from a trip to China with cough and other symptoms was taken to hospital on the evening of the 25th. But the next day at noon out of the test results, this person only got a common cold. The health department lifted the warning.\nBut the good news didn't last long. On the evening of 27, a new coronavirus patient appeared in Germany for the first time. The Ministry of health in Bavaria confirmed that a man from the stanberg District of Bavaria had been infected. However, the patient is in good health, has been isolated and continues to receive observation. Bazhou says Bazhou people are at low risk of new coronavirus infection.\nGiven that France, the United States, Japan and other countries have announced that they will withdraw their citizens from the city of Wuhan, Germany has also begun to consider withdrawing overseas Chinese. \"We are considering withdrawing all Germans who are willing to leave,\" foreign minister Marcus said at a news conference on Monday, Reuters reported Maas also said that Germans should avoid all unnecessary travel to China. A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said there were about 90 German citizens in Wuhan; there was no sign that Germans in Wuhan had been affected by the coronavirus.\nBerlin, the capital, has put up posters warning of the coronavirus at the airport, the world daily reported. There are warning posters at teger and schneifeld Airports\n。 Airport spokesman said the posters were posted in the arrival area, which mentioned the symptoms of pneumonia in Wuhan and preventive measures. The posters are in German, English and Chinese. \"For some specially selected flights from China, we will also send notes to passengers.\" If you are suspected of illness, you can contact the airport staff at any time.\nGerman hospitals have enough capacity to cope with the arrival of coronavirus, a number of medical experts told the media.\nDilek kalayci, health minister of the city government, warned people not to panic, the Berlin Morning Post reported. According to estimates from Robert Koch college, the risk of a coronavirus impact in Germany is currently low, she said. The emergency department and emergency service department of each hospital have got the information about the pneumonia and are ready to deal with it. Berlin has the Institute of Virology and the sharit hospital in the center of the city has a special isolation ward. This will help Berlin fight the new virus.\nGerman focus Weekly reported that Xinhua news agency released a news report on the 26th that Chinese doctors have achieved preliminary results in treating patients with new virus. More than ten patients not only did not have fever, but also checked again if there was coronavirus, the result was negative.

According to China's National Health Commission, based on the benchmark of 0:00 on the 29th, the number of confirmed pneumonia cases and deaths in Wuhan in 31 provinces has increased to 5974 and 132 respectively. At that time, 5327 cases were confirmed and 349 cases died.\nIn particular, 840 new confirmed cases and 25 new deaths were reported in Hubei Province, the birthplace of Wuhan pneumonia. As a result, the cumulative death cases of pneumonia in Wuhan Province alone reached 125, and the confirmed cases reached 3554. In one day, 1459 new confirmed cases and 26 new deaths occurred in China.\nThe report said that this proves that despite the mobilization of all national resources by the Chinese government, the epidemic has not been effectively controlled.\nAccording to the report, the World Health Organization (who) estimates the transmission rate of pneumonia in Wuhan at 1.4-2.5. The Imperial College of technology team in London estimated that the transmission rate of pneumonia in Wuhan was 2.1-3.5.\nThe death rate of pneumonia in Wuhan is about 2-3%, according to statistics released by the South Korean Department of disease management on the morning of the 28th. So far, it is still lower than SARS (9.6%) and mers (34.5%). However, the number of confirmed cases and deaths is still increasing. According to the current spread rate, the death rate of pneumonia in Wuhan is likely to exceed 10%.\nAccording to the report, it is generally believed that it is only a matter of time before the number of people infected with pneumonia in Wuhan exceeds that of SARS (8000 cases) worldwide. According to a professor of Infectious Medicine in South Korea, \"SARS at that time caused 8000 infections and 774 deaths in 37 countries.\" in terms of the current spread rate, the number of global infections may exceed 8000, surpassing SARS.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Dracula's companion, bloodsucking night warmers, and now also dangerous virus seekers, who are to blame for the Coronavirus outbreak in China. The image of the bats has received another crack when genetic analysis of the new pathogen with the provisional name 2019-nCoV revealed: It is 88 percent related to a virus that treats under horseshoe noses (The Lancet: Lu et al. 2020). Bats, flying dogs and their relatives are particularly popular in Germany. Many people have been campaigning for decades for the protection of the 25-species native to us, almost a third of which are considered endangered or threatened with extinction.\nIt is not until the current coronavirus epidemic that bats are held accountable when an animal-borne pathogen spreads among humans. Fleas are considered to be a popular reservoir for viruses, i.e. the viruses are dormant in them and waiting for their chance to spread across species boundaries. When the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (Mers-CoV) also caused the first outbreak of the Coronavirus (Mers-CoV) in the year 2012 on the Arabian Peninsula, it was dromedars that transmitted the new pathogen to humans. But bats must have infected the camels.\nThe Nipah virus, which affected pig farmers for the first time in Malaysia, can also be traced back to bats: the farmers were infected by their pigs, who had eaten fruit again, on which feces and urine were glued by flying dogs. It is precisely this interplay of different species as hosts of viruses that divides scientists into at least two camps: some stress that the viruses originated from bats. The others focus on the fact that it was camels and pigs that transmitted the diseases to humans.\nYeah. Ultimately, the causal question remains one of the interpretations: is the type of causator of an epidemic that originally harbored the virus? Or the one who passed it on to humans?\nMost viruses have hosts beyond species boundaries. They are constantly changing, exchanging heritage among themselves and learning new things: Thus, a pathogen that first only affects birds can, through mutations, acquire the ability to enter human cells, so an animal disease becomes a disease for humans. When that happens, scientists talk about zoonosis. The further mankind enters the habitat of animals, the higher the likelihood that new zoonoses will emerge. People blush forests, hunt and eat wild animals or seek adventure in the wilderness as tourists. Rather, they come into contact with infected animals and stick to them. Similarly, in a wildlife market in Wuhan, the epidemic with the new Coronavirus may have begun.\nWhen the inheritance of the new pathogen was sequenced a few weeks after the outbreak, it turned out to be 88 percent equal to the two Coronavirus species found for the first time in bats. It is clear that this pathogen originated from the bat,\"says Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, a virologist at the Bernhard Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine.\n\"I don't want to deny that the virus could have come from a bat at any time,\" says renowned bat researcher Paul Racey of Aberdeen University in Scotland.\nYeah. But he is a representative of the second group of researchers, who seems to be much more relevant to a completely different question: What kind of animal has the new virus ultimately transmitted to humans?\nBats are an order of mammals that, in the classical nomenclature, divide into the subordinates of flying dogs (Megachiroptera) and bats (Microchiroptera).\nRecent genetic analyses have shown, however, that the hoof-nosed species originally attributed to bats are more closely related to flying dogs. This is why zoologists nowadays distinguish bats from a new subsection, the yinterochiroptera: in turn, they include flying dogs and horseshoe-nosed (Rhinolophoidea).\nBats are usually nocturnal and can be spatially oriented by ultrasound. Most bats are smaller than flying dogs and feed mostly on insects. Flying dogs are called that because their head looks like a dog's. They are found mainly in the tropics and subtropes, where they feed mainly on fruit or nectar. In contrast to bats, flying dogs tend to orient themselves optically rather than over echo waves. Huffin-like species owe their name to a small patch of skin between the upper lip and the forehead, which is shaped like a Hufeisen. They feed, like bats, mainly on insects.\nBats are suspected to be the natural host of various viruses that can also make people sick: Ebola, Nipah, Hendra and Marburg as well as the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). In addition, researchers found similarities between the new Coronavirus 2019-nCoV and two virus strains found in bats.\nYeah.\nFor Racey, there would be clear evidence that the pathogen has passed directly from a bat or a flying dog to humans only if researchers could prove to a bat that it eliminates 2019-nCoV directly, so it actually spreads the virus. There is no such proof so far. The fact that two strands of viruses are similar in their heritage is not enough for bat researchers to blame the bats with their more than 1.400-known species alone for a new outbreak. After the rodents, they formed the most species-rich order of mammals, and were often targeted because of their large spread.\nAccording to Racey, it may be good that the new Coronavirus has long since passed from one bat to another. This intermediary could then have passed the agent on to humans, for example at the wildlife and fish market in Wuhan. What kind of animal this could be is still unclear.\" We don't know which animals were on the market,\"Racey says. Also Virologist Schmidt-Chanasit does not rule out that there was an intermediate host, i.e. animal species between bats and humans. But it is clear to him: the bat is the origin of the new Coronavirus. And whoever is the unknown landlord is being researched intensively.\nBut that is precisely what zoologists criticise: that all zoonoses are always researched until the bat appears at the origin of the infection chain. This is because not all potential species carrying viruses would be investigated equally intensively, says Merlin Tuttle, bat shooters and zoologists from the USA. Bats are easy to catch, Tuttle knows from his own experience: you set a trap at the entrance of a cave and wait, until the animals fly in.\" It would be much harder to catch thirty cobras than thirty bats,\"says the researcher\nYeah. The virologist Schmidt-Chanasit understands the argument, but says that you can argue the whole thing in the other direction: \"If you catch more bats, you might find a virus that matches the new Coronavirus to 99 percent.\"\nWhether Nipah, Sars or Mers: Bats are considered to be the original hearth for many viruses that can infect humans (trends in microbiology: Brook & Dobson, 2015). Often they carry the pathogens in the body without getting sick themselves. Why this is so, there are different theories about it: many have something to do with bats consuming extremely much energy while flying, which could also affect their immune system. It could, for example, result in their bodyguards not fighting viruses with full force but tolerating them by various means. This would also explain why the animals themselves do not get sick but can pass on the pathogens (Emerging Infectious Diseases: O'Shea et al., 2014). However, the exact mechanism has not yet been clarified.\nIt is at least clear that bats and flying dogs are \"an incredibly rich group of mammals\", says Fabian Leendertz, who is researching pathogenic microorganisms at the Robert Koch Institute of Epidemiology. And the more species there are, the higher the likelihood that the animals will host a greater variety of microbes. There are also very large bat populations that are a perfect reservoir for viruses. Individual species of flying dogs or bats do not necessarily have to be more mature than other animals. However, their diversity may make them frequent carriers. Researchers from the EcoHealth Alliance, a private research facility in New York, investigated 754 mammalian species and found that, overall, bats harbour more zoonotic viruses than any other mammalian species investigated (Nature: Olival et al., 2017)\nYeah.\nInter-owner or co-owner: the spread of the viruses is not the fault of the bat anyway. For nature does not know the principle of guilt. Seeing them as the cause may be right on the principle of causality, but it is too short-sighted. Voigt says, instead of pointing the finger at animals at any new pathogen emerging among humans, people should rather rethink their own behaviour towards wild animals. Wildlife plays a major role in transmitting viruses from animals to humans. Many zoonotic outbreaks, however, are not even due to people hunting large wild animals like monkeys in the jungle, Leendertz says. Instead, they are targeting so-called cultural successors, for example rats, bats and flying dogs that are in the vicinity of human habitations. At the same time, it is difficult to condemn such hunting practices on a global scale: hunting is an ancient tradition in many regions and is regarded as an important source of food. One problem is also the markets where people buy and sell wild animals. There, dead and living animals are offered in the narrowest space, people rush through the small alleys, everything mixes and mixes: a perfect place for a virus to spread quickly.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory\nYeah. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection.\nYeah. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nFledermaus researchers such as Racey and Tuttle fear that branding the flying dogs and bats as viral vectors will further worsen the relationship between them and humans.\" If bats are considered to be the cause of Ebola and other viruses, no one will accept a bat in their own garden anymore,\"says Tuttle. Recently he was called by the owner of an apartment complex: a bat flew into one of the apartments, the inhabitants are now afraid to have infected the animal with a disease.\" The current media reports on the connection between the Coronavirus and bats have certainly fuelled the story,\"Tuttle says\nYeah. Although Hufeisennasen may have played a role in the case of the new Coronavirus: here in Europe it is very unlikely that people will infect bats with a dangerous virus, says Christian Voigt, who is researching bats at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research. In Europe, bats could only transmit rabies. But this risk is also rather small: according to the Robert Koch Institute, the last rabies-related rabies-related case in Europe 2002 occurred in Scotland.\nThroughout the discussion about animals as vectors of disease, it is often forgotten how important they are to agriculture and nature worldwide, and what role they play in different ecosystems worldwide. Some flying dogs, but also few bats, pollinate just like bees and other useful crops. As insect eaters, our native bat species keep the pests in check. But not a few are now threatened with extinction. In this situation, the batsmen from the USA and Europe fear that an image of virus-spreading could further harm the animals: not only because then perhaps fewer people will donate for the protection of these animals than for sweet pandas or seal babies. It is also because they fear that bats could be systematically fought like rats or pigeons in the city. With all the excitement surrounding the origin of the new Coronavirus, the world should not lose sight of the global dramatic species death. Well, cursing bats doesn't protect you from any disease.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Whether they can be considered alive at all is a matter of opinion. Viruses have no metabolism, they don't breathe, they don't burn calories. They consist only of an inheritance molecule, packed in protein, sometimes wrapped in a fatty membrane. Viruses don't awaken to a kind of life until they've entered a body cell. Then the few virus genes take over the host and force him to multiply the pathogen by millions.\nNot all viruses make you sick. Not everyone is dangerous to humans. If the immune system is trained to defend itself, it can quickly stop an infection. Or at least it keeps the pathogen under control, like a herpes infection. But if the bodyguard is dealing with new or mutated viruses, they are not stored in the immune memory, then it can become dangerous.\nRNA viruses are particularly dangerous. They can change quickly and outdo the immune system over and over again. Their rapid change allows some of them to suddenly infect humans instead of an animal species. The Coronaviruses, 2002 and 2003 the Sars outbreaks, 2013 the Mers epidemic and now, since the end of 2019, the new wave of disease in Wuhan, were originally native to bats. From there comes the Ebola virus, the most dangerous variant of which can kill up to 80-percent of the infected. The annual recurring influenza viruses mutate into poultry and pigs, then jump to humans. HIV, probably the most insidious virus in the world, was originally an ape virus.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nThey all use, unlike many other viruses and all higher living beings, not the genetic molecule DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) as a memory for their genetic information, but its chemical relatives, the ribonucleic acid RNA, and that has consequences.\nRNA viruses mutate very quickly, because the genetic molecule itself is chemically less stable than the pendant DNA\nYeah. Above all, however, the enzymes responsible for the reproduction of genetic information make many copy errors. The RNA polymerases lack a control function that possesses DNA-copying enzymes. These then check the newly formed copy of the inheritance molecule for errors and set up for correction.\nSince it runs without this mechanism, the RNA reproduction is much more imprecise. The consequence: Every emerging virus is a mutant. Most mutations harm the organism itself, but sometimes they also lead to new adaptations.\nHow dangerous a viral epidemic is ultimately depends on many circumstances. How quickly and how many of the infected kill the pathogen? How easily is it transmitted? Which way does he use for the transmission?\nA virus doesn't die with its victim unless it's infected enough other people before. If the infection is transmitted only from the original host, i.e. an animal, to humans, the spread of the disease will remain limited. However, if the pathogen succeeds in spreading from person to person, global pandemics may occur. This risk is particularly high if the air is transmitted by droplet infection. That's the thing about the flu. Also the new Coronavirus 2019-nCoV jumps through the air to its next victim.\nHowever, it is also crucial to the course of an epidemic at which stage of the disease the infected can infect other people. In the Sars epidemic 2002 and 2003, the viruses were only transmitted when the infected had clear symptoms of the disease and could be well identified. This seems to be the case with 2019-nCoV so far.\nHowever, a number of pathogens behave quite differently in this respect. You can already infect the next victim if the carrier has no complaints at all\nYeah. This strategy requires viruses that do not spread very easily, for example because they are only transmitted by blood-blood contact. The Ebola virus is an example of this infectious dynamic. It is not airborne and would scarcely spread if the disease were contagious only after the outbreak of haemorrhagic fever.\nThe most extreme example of this type of spread is HIV. This pathogen, too, is only transmitted to one person when it enters the bloodstream. Moreover, HIV is inefficient in doing so; not every contact establishes a new infection. This disadvantage is outweighed by the AIDS agent's extremely long incubation period. It can exist hidden for many years in the immune cells of an infected person until it triggers the immune deficiency, but before that, it uses the long time to infect many other sexual partners of its victim, unknown. Despite its low infectiveness, the HI virus has thus triggered one of the worst epidemics in human history.\nViruses are harder to fight with medicines than bacterial agents, for example. Because they have few genes in their heritage, they offer only a very limited number of points of attack for pharmacological substances. Virostatics are usually directed against DNA or RNA polymerases, which increase the inheritance of viruses. Other medicines block the formation of protective viral skin whites.\nThe few genes with which viruses can secure their existence make them a big mystery for biologists. Can this really be life? It is possible that viruses originated very early in the history of life, as a kind of parasitic inheritance that took hold of the first cells on Earth. Another hypothesis is that viruses were actually alive. These were cells that disposed of their metabolism and moved to a way of life as genetic parasites.\nYeah.\nWe are far from knowing everything about these seemingly simple creatures. But one thing is certain: there will always be a race, as researchers and doctors are now experiencing. Viruses from animal hosts will continue to pass on to humans.

        "news_content_translate_en": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) classifies the outbreak of the new Coronavirus as a \"health emergency of international importance\". This was explained by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in Geneva. This brings with it concrete recommendations to States to curb the spread across borders as far as possible. The declaration generally frees up more financial and other resources. However, despite the emergency, the WHO sees \"no reason\" for travel and trade restrictions with China, the WHO Director continued. The WHO does not recommend any restrictions, but even rejects them.\"\nAfter a crisis session, the WHO pointed out that the number of cases had more than doubled within a week. Ghebreyesus said the number of infections outside China was still relatively small. But it is not known what damage the virus would do in a country with a weak health system. The decision was not a \"vote of no confidence\" against China. Last week the WHO decided otherwise.\n2005 196 States have agreed on International Health Regulations (IHR). Since then, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has called for five international health emergencies (PHEIC):\nIn Bavaria, another patient has been infected with the new Coronavirus from China. It is an employee of Webasto from the district of Starnberg, which also employs the four persons previously known to be concerned, as reported by the Bavarian Ministry of Health. The fifth confirmed patient is reported to live in Traunstein County.\nThe Federal Republic is planning a withdrawal action for German citizens from the particularly badly affected city of Wuhan. The flight was initially scheduled for Saturday. I'm sure it wasn't on Thursday either. Participation is voluntary\nYeah. According to estimates so far, it is about 90-year-old citizens. The returnees are to spend 14-day quarantine at the Germersheim Air Force Base in Rhineland-Palatinate, as the newspapers of the VRM Media House first reported.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan\nYeah. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite.\nYeah. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nThousands of passengers were stranded on a cruise ship in Italy on Thursday on suspicion of Corona. A tourist from the Chinese special management zone Macao had complained of fever and respiratory problems on the Costa Smeralda. She and her husband were isolated and examined for the virus. More than 6.600 people were not allowed to leave the ship in the port of Civitavecchia. Only in the evening came the revelation: the test results of the two were negative, the Ministry of Health in Rome announced. Passengers were allowed ashore.\nThe number of infections with the new Coronavirus 2019-nCoV has now surpassed the worldwide cases of the Sars pandemic 17 years ago. With 317 new diseases reported by the authorities of the severely affected province of Hubei in Central China on Thursday, the total number climbed to more than 8.100 worldwide. According to the World Health Organization 8.096, people who were ill and 774 had died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The new virus, which is related to the Sars pathogen, has so far killed 170 people.\nWith the first disease in Tibet, infections have now been detected in all regions and provinces of China. The rise is rapid. Two weeks ago, 40 cases had only been counted. The climax of the epidemic is expected within a week at the earliest. Outside the People's Republic, more than 100 infections have been counted in around 20 countries. There are five confirmed cases in Germany so far. Patients are reported to be symptomless on Thursday.\nRead here an analysis of why the WHO has now declared an international health emergency.\n",

After Tibet also reported the first disease with the new Coronavirus, infections have now been detected in all regions and provinces of China. The first cases occurred at the end of December in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.\nFrance also reported another infection. The fifth disease in the country is now the daughter of an 80-year-old Chinese tourist who is also ill, the French Ministry of Health reported. The condition of the 80-year-old was serious, the man continued to be treated in a Paris hospital. In addition, the condition of another infected 30-year-old who has been treated since the end of last week has worsened. Currently, around 50-year-old infections with the corona virus have been confirmed outside China.\nThe first four patients in Germany were, according to the Chief Medical Officer Clemens Wendtner of the Munich clinic Schwabing, symptomless and in good clinical condition on Wednesday.\nMany states, including Germany, continue to work to get their citizens out of the particularly affected city of Wuhan in Central China. In Japan the second charter machine with 210 compatriots from Wuhan returned on Thursday. The day before, 206 Japanese had already been detained. According to previous findings, none of them have so far been positive for the new agent. The United States had also flown out on Wednesday around 200.\nWhen exactly does a Federal Army plane start to pick up Germans from Wuhan, it was still unclear on Thursday\nYeah. No infections or suspected cases have been detected so far among the 90-German and family members living in the region around the capital of Wuhan. The Federal Army's plane is to land in Frankfurt. The passengers are to be quarantined there first. According to the Federal Ministry of Health, in consultation with the Hessian authorities, it was decided to place returnees centrally during the 14-day incubation period.\nThe head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Emergency Chief Michael Ryan showed concern on Wednesday about the \"rapid spread\" of lung disease. However, they were very impressed by the Chinese activities.\n\"The Chinese behavior during the Sars outbreak and the Chinese behavior today\"absolutely no comparison,\"said Ryan, who was already involved during the Sars outbreak 2003. The fact that so far there have only been a few dozen cases abroad is due to the stringent measures taken by China.\nOn the question of whether the WHO recommends the departure of foreigners, Tedros said: \"The decision is, of course, up to each country itself. But they must be well prepared if the virus is to be introduced in this way.\"\nIn view of the rapid spread of the new Coronavirus, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has again convened the Emergency Committee for Thursday.\nAfter British Airways and Lufthansa, more and more airlines are cancelling their flights to China. The Spanish airline Iberia will also cancel all connections to and from China as of Friday. The airline normally offers three flights a week between Madrid and Shanghai.\nChina's CFA football association announced on Thursday that it would postpone the country's football season for the time being. This is to protect the health of fans and players. A new start date was not mentioned at first\nYeah.\nAccording to the US Federal Reserve, Chinese economic growth is expected to be somewhat lower due to the new Coronavirus. It was too early to predict the effects accurately, but a \"certain disruption\" of economic life in the short term was very likely, said Federal Reserve Chief Jerome Powell on Wednesday before journalists. Weaker growth in China, the second largest economy in the world, would also be noticeable in the US, but only very limited, Powell said.

According to his treating physician, the man is \"very well\". \"He is fever-free, also currently has no respiratory symptoms,\" said Clemens Wendtner, chief physician at Schwabing Clinic in Munich, on Tuesday. The man is treated at the normal isolation station in a room with lock. \"The special isolation station is not activated and is not activated for this patient,\" said Wendtner. He stressed \"There is no danger for co-patients.\" Close contacts such as family members and colleagues of the 33-year-old are encouraged to stay at home.\nThe man was infected by a Chinese guest of his company, explained the President of the Bavarian National Office for Health and Food Safety, Andreas Zapf, on Tuesday in Munich. At first, there were no other suspicious cases where people were already showing symptoms. The authorities were busy finding out who the two employees of Webasto had contact with. This should be done quickly.\nCurrently 40 contacts in the company and family are being checked, said the head of the Task Force Infectiology, Martin Hoch. There is also a kindergarten under observation: the patient comes from the district of Landsberg am Lech and is reported to have children in the kindergarten.\nThe 33-year-old had participated in a training session of his company Webasto, in which a colleague from the company's factory in Shanghai also participated. Prior to her trip to Germany, the woman had a visit from her parents, who came from the region of Wuhan that was particularly affected. She was at 23rd. flew back in January and felt sick on the way home. According to Webasto, it is also in stationary treatment\nYeah.\nThe Chinese and German employees had worked together in a small group during the training, said Martin Hoch. The infection occurred \"at an interval when the Chinese woman was still symptomless,\" said President Zapf. The new Coronavirus 2019-nCoV can cause a lung disease that has already killed more than 100 people in the main country of China, most of whom were elderly patients with severe pre-existing diseases. Transmission before symptoms occur is considered very rare.\nParticularly in the case in Bavaria, it is also one of only three known evidence in the world so far where the infection occurred outside China. Until now, almost all of the infections in France, the USA, Thailand and other Asian countries were imported. Those affected were infected on a trip to China. According to the authorities of Vietnam, there was a human-to-human transmission outside China between father and son. A first case of transfer in Japan was reported on Tuesday. The bus driver in his 60s had driven two groups of Chinese tourists from Wuhan at the beginning of the month, announced Health Minister Katsunobu Kato.\nThe staff at the Stockdorfer Central has been cleared by Webasto management for this week, whether they want to come to the office or rather work at home. The company had previously cancelled all business trips to China for the next two weeks.\nWebasto is a major supplier for the automotive industry with 13.400 employees and a turnover of 3.4 billion euro a year 2018. Worldwide, the company has more than 50 locations from the Upper Bavarian village of Stockdorf\nYeah. According to the company website, there are other locations in the Bavarian towns of Gilching, Utting, Schierling, Hengersberg, Regensburg and Nuremberg as well as in Wuerth (Rhineland-Palatinate) and Neubrandenburg in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. There are therefore twelve locations in China. The main products of the company are panoramic, sliding and convertible roofs as well as standing heaters, heating systems for hybrid and electric vehicles as well as air conditioning systems.\nFederal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) stressed in the morning that the case showed \"that we are well prepared\". The risk to human health in Germany remains low, according to the RKI, according to the Ministry's communication. Three infections with the novel virus had previously been detected in Europe. All concerned people in France who had previously been to China.\nThe total number of known diseases worldwide has now increased to more than 4500, after Chinese state television reported a jump by more than 1700 cases on Tuesday compared to the previous day. In Hubei province alone, which was particularly badly affected, there were also 24 more deaths, so that at least 106 people died of lung disease nationwide.\nThe new virus 2019-nCoV was originally believed to originate from a market in the Chinese millionaire city of Wuhan, where wild animals traded there probably jumped to humans. There is no protective vaccination or special treatment to treat the disease. However, the symptoms, including dry cough, fever and shortness of breath, can be alleviated with medication.\nAccording to current experts, the new type of lung disease appears to be mild in most cases, possibly even without symptoms. The new pathogen is very similar to the virus behind the Sars epidemic 2002/2003\nYeah. At that time, according to data from the World Health Organisation, there had been nine proofs in Germany between November 2002 and July 2003. There were no deaths here.\n+++ This article was updated at 12.24 clock +++\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "HONG KONG — Chinese health officials on Friday (Feb 7) sought to assuage a jittery public over the strength of the novel coronavirus which has sickened more than 31,200 people across the country. \n Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, Dr Wang Guoqiang, an infectious disease expert at Peking University No 1 Hospital, said that preliminary data about people who had recovered after being infected was promising. \n Based on a small sample of discharged patients from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, Dr Wang said that about 6 per cent had recovered after being in a serious condition, while less than one per cent had recovered after being classed as in critical condition. \n “This shows that cases in serious and critical conditions can be treated and discharged from hospital after receiving proactive treatment, and that has given us great confidence,” he said. \n “We now have expert teams supporting Wuhan, especially those who have been transferred from intensive care units. \n “I think this will greatly reduce the mortality of patients in critical condition and improve the recovery rate,” he said. \n Ms Guo Yanhong, a senior inspector with the National Health Commission, said at the briefing that the addition of “medical shelters” in Wuhan — which will provide 4,600 beds once completed — would greatly help in the treatment of patients with mild symptoms, and prevent them from developing complications and aggravating their illness. \n “Our capacity to treat patients is significantly boosted by these medical shelters… enabling us to lower infections,” she said. \n Dr Wang said the new shelters would “enable us to segregate the patients, ensure they are properly isolated and hence preventing infection, and also allow us to better identify patients who may have the risk of becoming critically ill”\n. \n The new coronavirus, which was first reported in Wuhan in December, has killed 638 people — all but two of them in mainland China — and sickened more than 31,500 people globally. As of Friday, more than 1,600 people had recovered after being infected. \n Dr Hitoshi Oshitani, a virology professor from Tohoku University in Japan, said it was promising that some critically ill patients had recovered. \n “[Mortality] is definitely much lower than Sars. The true figure may be even lower. But it is also definitely higher than seasonal influenza,” he said referring to severe acute respiratory syndrome, which killed about 800 people around the world in 2002-03. \n But Dr Oshitani called on China to make more real-time data available. \n “For example, we want to know what is happening in major cities such as Chongqing. This is critically important in predicting what is going to happen in other cities such as Tokyo,” he said. \n As well as figures for confirmed cases, those in serious condition and discharged, Dr Oshitani said it would be useful to have data on how many patients had been infected because of local transmission or were imported cases from Wuhan as that would hold the key to determining whether the spread of the virus was controllable. \n “If most of them are still imported cases from Wuhan, they may be able to control the situation. If there is a widespread local transmission, it is totally different,” he said. \n The most recent figures, released on Tuesday, showed that about 60 per cent of Chongqing’s cases were imported and 40 per cent were locally transmitted. \n But locally transmitted cases had begun to overtake imported cases, the local health commission said. \n Dr Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor at Duke University in the United States, said that without population-based studies, metrics such as pathogenicity, the percentage of those who develop severe disease among the infected, and mortality may not be precise\n. \n “I think many epidemiologists suspect the estimates for 2019-nCoV disease severity are a bit exaggerated,” he said, using the official name of the virus. \n “Metrics like pathogenicity and mortality are falsely elevated because infected people with few or no symptoms are not being counted in the denominators.” \n But Dr Gray also acknowledged that there were people in China suspected of contracting the coronavirus but who had not been tested. They would not be counted in the statistics, which further complicated the assessment of the disease, he said. SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Anxiety is creeping up as the virus which originated in Wuhan spreads around the world, showing no sign as yet of abating. \n Singapore is at code orange in its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition, a crisis management system drafted and refined after Singapore's experience of tackling the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003. \n It was at yellow for days before being raised to orange on Friday evening, after a few local cases emerged without any links to previous cases or travel history to China. \n Will it move to red, which would mean the virus is severe and spreading widely? \n From what is known publicly, the coronavirus appears to be more infectious than Sars, which hit Singapore in 2003 from March to May, infecting 238 and killing 33. \n Sars infected more than 8,000 people worldwide over several months, and killed about 774. \n However, the coronavirus appears less deadly, with a mortality rate of about 2 per cent, compared with Sars' 9.6 per cent. \n The Middle East respiratory syndrome virus in 2012 infected about 2,500 people worldwide but was deadlier, with a fatality rate of 34 per cent. \n With the coronavirus, as of yesterday, more than 34,000 have been infected since December, and more than 700 have died in China. \n In Singapore, there are 40 infected persons as of yesterday. \n Outside of Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, the mortality rate is only 0.2 per cent so far, while seasonal influenza has a death rate of 0.1 per cent. This makes the new virus much closer to influenza than Sars. \n Sars was spread by people after they developed symptoms like fever; 2019-nCoV, as the new virus is officially known, appears to be sneakier, and can spread from an infected person who shows no symptoms. \n This makes the coronavirus harder to detect and easier to spread. The odds of it spiralling out of control within the community are thus higher than with Sars\n. \n However, initial reports suggest that it does not make people as sick as Sars did. Some doctors are already predicting that this coronavirus may be more like influenza - many people could get infected with mild sickness; a small proportion (now 15 per cent) will get seriously sick but will recover; and a tiny fraction (now 2 per cent) may die. \n In May 2009, the H1N1 outbreak from the United States surged into Singapore. By the time it came under control in February 2010, 415,000 people here had been infected, and 420,000 had been vaccinated. \n In the end, 18 people here died of the H1N1 virus, which remains the dominant flu strain globally and in Singapore. It is highly infectious, but people have come to terms with living with it, as it has a low fatality rate of 0.02 per cent. \n Will the coronavirus turn out to be a highly infectious non-event? Or a fast-spreading virus that kills a large number in its wake? \n So far, several experts have predicted it will be the former. \n Meanwhile, China is patenting a drug found to be highly effective in treating the disease. Many labs around the world are also vying to be the first to develop a vaccine. \n Singaporeans should educate and update themselves on the virus so that they can make rational, sensible choices for themselves and their families. \n In Singapore, it is clear that political leaders are trying to prepare Singaporeans for the long haul. No one can predict for sure how this virus outbreak will pan out. But the experience of Sars gives some pointers. \n I am the author of a book on Sars. Titled A Defining Moment: How Singapore Beat Sars, it was published in 2004, and it details Singapore's whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach to battling the virus. (The book is out of print, but can be borrowed from the National Library.) \n Drawing from what we went through with Sars, we can better prepare ourselves for the long battle against the coronavirus\n. \n One key takeaway from that experience is that when there is wide community spread, the battle against the virus will be as much about mindsets as it is about medicine. \n The psychological aspect came to the fore over the weekend, as many people in Singapore, young and old, stripped supermarket shelves of essentials like noodles, rice and even toilet paper, in a frenzy of stockpiling. This was despite assurances from government leaders and retailers that there are stocks aplenty in warehouses. \n Singapore is a small, close-knit society, and prone to the herd mentality and mass behaviour. \n Social psychology tells us that in times of anxiety, people tend to conform and follow what others are doing. (\"My neighbours are stocking up on food; they know something I don't, so I am going to do the same.\") \n They also start to worry for themselves and their loved ones. (\"Everyone else is stocking up; there won't be any left for me and my family; I am going out to grab my share.\") \n The best way to stop such thinking is to be rational. (\"How many packs of rice do I need? Are rice imports going to stop? Will there be rice stocks next week?\") \n And then be deliberately pro-social and think of others. (\"Do I really need all these alcohol swabs now? What if I buy the last pack of swabs and deprive a sick person who needs it for his daily injection?\") \n Individual actions have collective impact. We are all in this virus outbreak together, and we stand or fall together. \n Right now, most of us still go about our daily lives sans mask, gloves or protective clothing, albeit with more attention to hand washing with soap and water, using hand sanitiser and avoiding touching our faces - infection control tips 101. \n But the mood can shift quickly, and we can become a city ruled by fear of strangers and public spaces. \n For example, about 30,000 workers from China have yet to return to Singapore from their Chinese New Year leave\n. There is a risk of infections going up when they return. \n As concerns about community spread widen, more people can be expected to take precautions to protect their loved ones and themselves, by donning protective gear or avoiding crowded spaces. \n With Sars, once the virus spread, people started fearing being around others, not knowing who might be infected. \n They then reacted by shunning those at risk. Many also stayed home, away from shops and eateries, causing businesses to suffer. It took concerted action to shift Singaporeans' mindsets. \n The Sars experience reminds us that the battle against the virus is fought on two fronts: medical and psychological. \n The medical battle has to do with screening, public hygiene, infection control, diagnosis, treatment of patients, and the race to develop quicker diagnostic tools, better treatment protocols or a vaccine. \n The psychological war is about overcoming fear, prejudice and paranoia. \n From Sars, we know there are three fronts in the psychological battle. \n We must guard against ostracising healthcare workers, who are at the forefront of the fight against the virus. \n As the virus spreads widely, more people will be infected and need care. This means healthcare workers will be at greater risk. \n During Sars, some Singaporeans reacted by shunning them. This is already happening again. Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam noted in a Facebook post on Friday that he had heard anecdotally about cases of abuse directed at healthcare workers. \n Nurses have taken to Facebook to share anecdotes of how they were ostracised on the MRT and scolded for wearing their uniforms onto the train as fellow travellers feared they were spreading germs. \n This prompted commenters to express support for the nurses, with one post saying: \"If you think the nurses and doctors carry lots of germs or if you think that we are dirty, please get your family to nurse you when you are hospitalised\n.\" \n A young nurse I featured in the Sars book described how, after working hard all day to treat patients at \"Sars central\" in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), she would find herself shunned on the MRT because of her nurse's uniform; neighbours refused to share a lift with her, or shut their windows as she walked past their flats. \n She said with a frown: \"It made me really angry. Here we were, trying our best to fight for our patients. If we were not there in the Sars wards, who would be there for them?\" \n Others complained that buses and cabs, and even pizza delivery staff, refused to call at TTSH stops. \n The issue was made public by ministers, who urged Singaporeans to change their mindsets. \n Within days, people responded. About 500,000 peach ribbons were made and worn by members of the public to support healthcare workers. TTSH received sachets of herbal lozenges for their staff; anonymous donors sent 60 crates of Fuji apples and 1,000 stalks of gerberas. A fund to salute healthcare workers, called The Courage Fund, raised $28.5 million, and fund administrators had to ask the public to stop giving to it. \n The change motivated healthcare workers and created a more positive atmosphere nationwide. \n This time round, I hope Singaporeans will avoid the shunning and abusive stage and go straight to the stage of appreciating our front-line soldiers in the fight against the virus. \n Of those who died during Sars, about 40 per cent were healthcare workers. They put their lives on the line to care for those infected. They are heroes. They deserve our support and appreciation, not our fear and discrimination. \n Words, thoughtful acts, practical or heartfelt tokens and social media tributes can all make a difference in rallying our healthcare troops. \n The second front in the psychological war is in business. \n As the virus spreads and fear rises, the temptation to hunker down and stay home will prove irresistible. But this will affect businesses badly\n. A shutdown will only harm our own society. \n During Sars, Singaporeans went into panic lockdown mode for a few weeks. The mood seemed darkest in late March and early April, four weeks into the outbreak. \n In April came news that the virus had spread to the Singapore General Hospital, and then beyond hospitals, to a wholesale market. \n But the mood suddenly shifted in the second half of April, and people started coming out to shop. \n Clothing retailer Zara's opening on April 23 at Liat Towers attracted hundreds. Best Denki's $99 offer of a bar fridge at its new Bishan Junction 8 outlet drew a queue of 200 by opening time. Concerts went ahead. Pubs and nightspots reported a surge in business. \n \"It was almost as though the Sars-induced fear had a life of its own - its own incubation period, and its own life cycle. It was as though, after being cooped up for weeks, Singaporeans decided enough was enough and ventured out,\" I wrote in the book. \n What shifted the mood were deliberate campaigns to boost consumer confidence, bolstered by savvy sales promotions (like the $99 fridge). \n One important initiative was the Cool Singapore programme to provide a Sars-free corridor for tourists and shoppers by ensuring that places like the airport, taxis, hotels, shopping malls and restaurants were Sars-free. \n This was done by introducing regular temperature checks and screening measures at these places. Establishments that met criteria for such screening were audited and certified fever-free to assure shoppers. \n The programme was effective, as no case of Sars surfaced at these establishments, since staff with fever were quickly identified and isolated. It also sent a message to the world that Singapore had Sars under control. \n If Sars was any guide, people will hunker down first, then bounce back to business as usual if they feel safe and if deals are attractive enough\n. Reassurances of safety should thus be matched by concrete action like a programme to audit and certify retail joints. \n The third front in the psychological battle against the virus lies in our own hearts and mindsets. \n It is too easy to blame the victim and lash out with anti-China or anti-Chinese sentiments, as is happening worldwide. In the US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, France, Denmark and a host of other countries, some people and media reports are targeting people from China, people who are ethnic Chinese or people who look East Asian for abuse because of the virus. \n In Singapore, where the majority population is ethnic Chinese, we must not succumb to such racism or xenophobia. We must remember that foreigners are not the culprits; indeed, about one-third of our healthcare workforce, who are risking their lives to fight the virus, are foreign. \n China, meanwhile, is putting up a valiant fight to contain the virus, after an initial state of denial. As many have noted, locking down Wuhan and its surrounds to contain the virus was tantamount to sacrificing a province to save the rest of China and the world. \n After interviewing scores of people for the Sars book, including patients, nurses, doctors, hospital chiefs, civil servants and government ministers, I came away convinced that the much-criticised Singapore nanny state is impressive in action. \n Government authorities nagged about hygiene, cajoled shoppers onto the streets, and enforced quarantine orders. \n The state and its apparatus of community organisations, unions, business groups, religious groups, media organisations and grassroots bodies worked together to trace contacts and deliver timely information, thermometers and food to the quarantined and consolation to the isolated. \n Each night, a press conference helmed by ministers debunked rumours, keeping the information flow open and smooth\n. \n Today, 17 years later, the Singapore Government should be better prepared than in 2003 to lead the fight against the new coronavirus. Meanwhile, our healthcare workers are highly trained and brave. \n It remains for us, as individuals, to realise that what we each do makes a huge collective difference. \n Take responsibility for personal hygiene. Wash hands. Avoid touching your face. Observe leave of absence and quarantine rules. Mask up if unwell and seek medical attention. \n Act responsibly and avoid panic behaviour like stockpiling food, masks or protective equipment. Doing so increases the chance of shortages for people who genuinely need the items. \n Do not shun or shame but be kind to all, including the infected, the quarantined, healthcare workers and those from China. \n Most of all, do not give in to paranoia or fear.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "随着起源于武汉的病毒在世界各地传播，焦虑情绪也在逐渐蔓延，目前还没有迹象表明正在消退。\n新加坡的疾病爆发应对系统状况正处于橙色代码状态，这是继2003年新加坡应对严重急性呼吸系统综合症（Sars）爆发的经验之后起草和完善的危机管理系统。\n几天来一直是黄色，直到周五晚上被提升为橙色，此前出现了一些与以往病例或到中国旅行历史没有任何联系的当地病例。\n它会变成红色吗？红色意味着病毒很严重，而且传播范围很广？\n据公开所知，冠状病毒似乎比2003年3月至5月袭击新加坡的非典更具传染性，共感染238人，造成33人死亡。\n在过去的几个月里，Sars在全球范围内感染了8000多人，导致774人死亡。\n然而，冠状病毒的致死率似乎较低，与Sars的9.6%相比，其死亡率约为2%。\n2012年，中东呼吸综合征病毒感染了全球约2500人，但死亡人数更高，病死率为34%。\n随着冠状病毒的传播，截至昨天，自去年12月以来，中国已经有34000多人感染冠状病毒，700多人死亡。\n截至昨日，新加坡共有40名感染者。\n在武汉所在的湖北省外，目前死亡率仅为0.2%，而季节性流感的死亡率为0.1%。这使得新病毒比Sars更接近流感。\n非典型肺炎是在人们出现发烧等症状后传播的；2019年的nCoV，正如官方所知，似乎更狡猾，可以从没有任何症状的感染者身上传播。\n这使得冠状病毒更难检测，更容易传播。因此，它在社区内失控的几率比非典高\n.\n然而，最初的报告显示，它并不像Sars那样让人生病。一些医生已经预测，这种冠状病毒可能更像流感——许多人可能会感染轻微疾病；一小部分人（现在是15%）会重病但会康复；一小部分人（现在是2%）可能会死亡。\n2009年5月，从美国爆发的H1N1疫情涌入新加坡。到2010年2月控制时，这里已有41.5万人感染，42万人接种了疫苗。\n最终，这里有18人死于H1N1病毒，而H1N1病毒仍然是全球和新加坡的主要流感病毒株。它具有很强的传染性，但人们已经接受了与它一起生活，因为它的死亡率很低，只有0.02%。\n冠状病毒会变成一种高度传染性的非事件吗？或者是一种快速传播的病毒，在它之后杀死了大量的人？\n到目前为止，有几位专家预测这将是前者。\n与此同时，中国正在申请一种治疗该病的高效药物的专利。世界各地的许多实验室也在争先恐后地开发疫苗。\n新加坡人应该对自己进行有关病毒的教育和更新，以便为自己和家人做出理性、明智的选择。\n在新加坡，很明显，政治领导人正试图让新加坡人做好长期准备。没有人能确切预测这次病毒爆发的结果。但非典的经历给了我们一些启示。\n我是一本关于非典的书的作者。2004年出版的《决定性时刻：新加坡如何战胜非典》一书详细介绍了新加坡政府和全社会抗击非典的方法。（这本书已绝版，但可以从国家图书馆借阅。）\n从我们经历的非典中，我们可以更好地为对抗冠状病毒的长期斗争做好准备\n.\n这一经历的一个重要收获是，当社区广泛传播时，与病毒的斗争将与医学一样，更多的是关于心态。\n心理方面的问题在上周末凸显出来，因为新加坡许多人，无论老少，都疯狂地囤积着超市货架上的面条、大米甚至厕纸等必需品。尽管政府领导人和零售商保证仓库里有大量存货，但情况还是如此。\n新加坡是一个小而紧密的社会，容易产生从众心理和群体行为。\n社会心理学告诉我们，在焦虑的时候，人们倾向于遵从别人的行为。（“我的邻居正在囤积食物；他们知道一些我不知道的事情，所以我也要这样做。”）\n他们也开始为自己和亲人担心。（“其他人都在囤货，我和我的家人将一无所有；我要出去抢我的份额。”）\n停止这种想法的最好办法是保持理性。（“我需要多少包米饭？大米进口会停止吗？下周会有大米库存吗？”）\n然后故意亲社会，考虑别人。（“我现在真的需要这些酒精拭子吗？如果我买了最后一包棉签，剥夺了病人每天注射所需的棉签怎么办？”）\n个人行为具有集体影响。我们都是一起在这病毒爆发，我们站在一起或跌倒在一起。\n现在，我们大多数人仍然在日常生活中不戴口罩，不戴手套，不穿防护服，尽管更注意用肥皂和水洗手，使用洗手液，避免触摸我们的脸-感染控制技巧101。\n但这种情绪会很快转变，我们可以成为一个由对陌生人和公共场所的恐惧所统治的城市。\n例如，约有3万名来自中国的工人尚未从春节假期返回新加坡\n. 当他们回来的时候，感染的风险会上升。\n随着人们对社区的担忧越来越大，可以期望更多的人采取预防措施，通过穿上防护服或避开拥挤的空间来保护他们的亲人和自己。\n非典病毒一旦传播，人们开始害怕与他人在一起，不知道谁可能被感染。\n然后他们做出反应，避开那些有风险的人。许多人还呆在家里，远离商店和餐馆，使企业蒙受损失。它采取了一致行动来改变新加坡人的心态。\n非典的经历提醒我们，抗击非典的斗争有两条战线：医学和心理学。\n这场医疗战与筛查、公共卫生、感染控制、诊断、患者治疗以及开发更快的诊断工具、更好的治疗方案或疫苗的竞赛有关。\n心理战是关于克服恐惧、偏见和偏执。\n从非典看，心理战有三条战线。\n我们必须防止排斥卫生保健工作者，他们是对抗病毒的最前线。\n随着病毒的广泛传播，会有更多的人受到感染，需要护理。这意味着医护人员将面临更大的风险。\n非典期间，一些新加坡人对此避而不见。这已经在发生了。内政部长尚穆加姆（K.Shanmugam）周五在Facebook上发表的一篇文章中指出，他听到了一些针对医护人员的虐待案例。\n护士们在Facebook上分享了他们在捷运上被排斥的趣闻轶事，并因穿着制服上火车而受到责骂，因为同行担心他们在传播病菌。\n这促使评论人士对这些护士表示支持，其中一个帖子说：“如果你认为护士和医生携带大量病菌，或者你认为我们是肮脏的，请让你的家人在你住院时护理你。”\n.\"\n我在《非典》一书中介绍了一位年轻的护士，她在谭托克生医院（TTSH）的“非典中心”为治疗病人辛苦工作了一整天之后，发现自己在捷运上因为护士的制服而被拒之门外；邻居们拒绝和她搭车，或者在她走过公寓时关上窗户。\n她皱着眉头说：“这让我很生气。我们在这里，尽力为我们的病人而战。如果我们不在非典病区，谁会在那里？”\n其他人则抱怨公交车和出租车，甚至披萨递送员，都拒绝在TTSH车站打电话。\n部长们公开了这一问题，敦促新加坡人改变心态。\n几天之内，人们做出了回应。大约50万条桃丝带由公众制作和佩戴，以支持医疗工作者。TTSH为他们的工作人员收到了几袋草药含片；匿名捐赠者送来了60箱富士苹果和1000根非洲菊茎。一项名为“勇气基金”（勇气基金）的向医护人员致敬的基金募集了2850万美元，基金管理人不得不要求公众停止向它捐款。\n这一变化激励了医疗工作者，并在全国范围内营造了一种更加积极的氛围。\n这一次，我希望新加坡人能避开回避和辱骂的阶段，直接走到欣赏我们抗击病毒前线士兵的阶段。\n在非典期间死亡的人中，约40%是医护人员。他们冒着生命危险去照顾那些感染者。他们是英雄。他们应该得到我们的支持和赞赏，而不是我们的恐惧和歧视。\n言语、深思熟虑的行为、实用或真挚的信物以及社交媒体的悼念，都能在凝聚我们的医疗队伍方面起到作用。\n心理战的第二条战线是商业。\n随着病毒的传播和恐惧感的上升，蹲下来呆在家里的诱惑将被证明是不可抗拒的。但这将严重影响企业\n. 停产只会损害我们自己的社会。\n非典期间，新加坡人进入恐慌封锁状态达数周之久。在疫情爆发四周后的三月底和四月初，人们的情绪似乎最为黑暗。\n今年4月，有消息称，病毒已经扩散到新加坡总医院，然后在医院之外，扩散到一个批发市场。\n但4月下旬，人们的情绪突然发生了变化，人们开始出来购物。\n服装零售商Zara 4月23日在Liat Towers的开业吸引了数百人。贝斯特登基（Best Denki）在其新的璧山8号交叉口（Bishan Junction 8 outlet）以99美元的价格提供一台酒吧冰箱，开张时间排起了200人的长队。音乐会继续进行。酒吧和夜总会报告生意激增。\n“几乎就好像非典引发的恐惧有它自己的生命——它自己的潜伏期和生命周期。我在书中写道：“就好像，在被关了几个星期之后，新加坡人觉得足够了，就冒险出去了。”。\n改变这种情绪的是精心策划的旨在提振消费者信心的活动，而精明的促销活动（如售价99美元的冰箱）则起到了推波助澜的作用。\n一个重要的倡议是“酷新加坡”计划，通过确保机场、出租车、酒店、购物商场和餐馆等地方无传染性非典型肺炎，为游客和购物者提供无传染性的走廊。\n这是通过在这些地方引入定期温度检查和筛选措施来实现的。对符合筛选标准的机构进行了审计，并证明其不发烧，以保证购物者。\n该方案是有效的，因为这些机构没有出现非典病例，因为发烧的工作人员很快被发现并隔离。它还向世界传递了一个信息，即新加坡已控制住非典。\n如果“非典”是一个导火索，人们会先蜷缩起来，如果感觉安全，如果交易足够吸引人，就会像往常一样恢复正常\n. 因此，安全保证应与具体行动相匹配，如审计和认证零售店的计划。\n对抗病毒心理战的第三条战线在于我们自己的内心和心态。\n像全世界正在发生的那样，指责受害者和抨击反华或反华情绪太容易了。在美国、加拿大、新西兰、澳大利亚、法国、丹麦等一系列国家，一些人和媒体的报道把矛头对准了中国人、华裔或因病毒而被东亚人虐待的人。\n在新加坡，大多数人口是华裔，我们决不能屈从于这种种族主义或仇外心理。我们必须记住，外国人不是罪魁祸首；事实上，约三分之一冒着生命危险抗击病毒的医疗工作者是外国人。\n与此同时，在最初的否认之后，中国正在进行一场遏制病毒的英勇斗争。正如许多人所指出的，封锁武汉及其周边地区以控制病毒，等于牺牲一个省来拯救中国其他地区和世界。\n在采访了许多人，包括病人、护士、医生、医院院长、公务员和政府部长等，之后，我确信，备受批评的新加坡保姆国家在行动中令人印象深刻。\n政府当局唠叨卫生问题，哄骗购物者上街，执行隔离令。\n国家及其由社区组织、工会、商业团体、宗教团体、媒体组织和基层机构组成的机构共同努力，追踪接触，及时向被隔离者提供信息、温度计和食物，并向被隔离者提供安慰。\n每晚，由部长们主持的新闻发布会都会揭穿谣言，保持信息畅通\n.\n17年后的今天，新加坡政府应该比2003年做好准备，领导抗击新冠状病毒的斗争。同时，我们的医护人员训练有素，勇敢无畏。\n作为个人，我们仍然需要认识到，我们每个人的所作所为都会带来巨大的集体差异。\n负责个人卫生。洗手。不要碰你的脸。遵守休假和检疫规定。如果身体不适，请戴上口罩并就医。\n负责任地行动，避免恐慌行为，如储存食物、口罩或防护设备。这样做增加了真正需要这些物品的人短缺的机会。\n不要逃避或羞辱，要善待所有人，包括受感染者、被隔离者、医护人员和来自中国的人。\n最重要的是，不要屈服于偏执或恐惧。保持冷静，继续前进。因为我们在一起。\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The citizens, 18 Portuguese and two Brazilian citizens, who arrived in Portugal on Sunday evening repatriated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak of the new coronavirus that has already infected more than 17 thousand people and killed more than 300, are well and without signs of respiratory disease. The Directorate-General for Health is still assessing when they can be repeated for analysis.\nThe 20 citizens are distributed by Pulido Valente Hospital and Health Park (four returnees are at this facility) in Lisbon, and were visited earlier this Monday afternoon by the International Sanity Team, coordinated by the Directorate-General for Health (DGS). W\n\"There is currently no clinical evidence to report. Last night's atmosphere was quite tranquil after a long journey. From the standpoint of the general state, they're all fine. We are also making sure that aspects of comfort are improved. We know the facility isn't a hotel. There are aspects that are being completed, such as some supporting material such as books, newspapers and the Internet,\"said the Health Minister at a press conference this Monday.\nHealth Director Grace Freitas supplemented clinical information: \"None of the people have developed symptoms related to the new disease. There has been no fever, cough or respiratory symptoms.\" 20 citizens can live together as long as they wear masks and comply with the recommendations made by health professionals.\nFor the time being, the analyses carried out at the end of Sunday night, the results of which were known this Monday, were negative for the presence of the new coronavirus. But they can be repeated, although the moment at which this may happen is still under consideration.\nThe first action, she said, will be symptom observation. \"The appearance of symptoms will cause repeat analysis\nYeah. All countries are learning from this new methodology. The virus was detected less than a month ago. There are countries that are conducting analyses at 48-hour and 72-hour intervals, some with symptoms and others only when quarantine is over. We are looking at the various hypotheses almost every day and will take a decision on the basis of what we think is best and what the other partner countries are doing,\"he explained.\nGrace Freitas also said that the DGS is counting on the cooperation of a group of experts and that it will be on the basis of the recommendation of this group that they will also take a decision on when to repeat the analyses. \"We have not yet made a decision. Tomorrow [Tuesday] we will speak to the experts again and, according to the experts, we will decide the frequency of the analyses.\"\nShould one of these people show any suspicious symptoms, the protocol that already exists will be triggered. The professional contacts the medical support line for validation of the case as a suspect, there will be collection of material for analysis and the person will be referred to the reference hospital. In the face of a positive case, if close contact has taken place with another of the masked returnees, it will be necessary to resume the quarantine cycle.\nQuestioned again on the issue of isolation and measures to be applied to other citizens from China, Mrs Marta Temido reminded us that legislation allows, in exceptional situations that do not occur, separation of persons in order to ensure the health of themselves and third parties.\n\"These are exceptional measures that are always dependent on some consideration, proportionality criteria and legislation; this is not the case, but we know that there are mechanisms that we have and will use if necessary to ensure that they are themselves placed in security situations, as well as the general community,\" explained the minister\nYeah.\nGrace Freitas once again stressed that this group of citizens is special because it has been at least thirty days at the epicentre of a new disease and has therefore been treated with special measures. \"These citizens are not the same as others who may come from China. That's why the Ministry of Health decided to treat them in a special way. Others who arrive at similar risk will receive similar treatment. For different risk, different treatment\", the Director-General for Health pointed out.\nPortugal currently has three reference hospitals for suspected cases of infection with the new coronavirus and two specialised ambulances for the displacement of these cases. The delay in moving a suspect case to St John's Hospital on Felgueiras led the Union of Emergency Technicians Pre-Hospitality to make several criticisms about the material made available in the ambulances, the means available elsewhere in the country and the information available.\nGrace Freitas explained that in this first phase, whose level is of disease containment, it is necessary to have a \"very restricted first-line service line, with a well-prepared laboratory and a very capable number of professionals\". At this time he said that they were working with the National Institute of Health Dr. Ricardo Jorge (Insa) and the Regional Health Administrations already thinking of a second line of response with more laboratories, transport network and other hospitals involved.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nQuestioned as to the protocol at this time if a suspicious case appears, e.g. in the Azores or Madeira, the person responsible has indicated that the patient will be set to leave in a hospital unit in the autonomous region and if there is no laboratory capacity in the area, will be the biological sample to be sent to Lisbon for testing in the reference laboratory\nYeah. Insa President Fernando Almeida stressed that the institute works in network with other 20 national laboratories, including in the islands, and that everyone has the technology to carry out the tests.\nMarta Temido added that an assessment is ongoing of what happened with the two suspicious cases that Portugal has already registered, one in Lisbon and one in Porto. \"We already have all the time line collection and we will do a detailed internal analysis to see what went less well and evaluate measures to be taken.\"\nThe Minister added that she spoke to the INEM President this Monday about the need to reshape the information and material available to all partners working with him. And that this Tuesday there will be a meeting of the National Public Health Council to reflect on the response capacity of each entity.\n",

It is the latest in the outbreak of the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that has already spread to 25 countries. More than 60 countries have already implemented containment measures, from requiring medical attestations to those landing flights from China to cancelling flights or closing schools, shops and services. The objective is to halt the spread of 2019-nCoV.\nOn Thursday the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the coronavirus as a public health emergency case of international interest. And even though the WHO has not recommended restricting travel, the number of airlines and countries that have suspended flights to China is constantly increasing. In Portugal, the contingency plan is activated. Firefighters, INEM and hospitals have received standards that should guide security procedures in suspicious cases.\nThe United States has declared a public health emergency and announced that flights from China are only allowed to land at seven American airports, where passenger control will be strengthened. The country also announced that from Sunday onwards foreign nationals who have been in the CHina in the last 14 days, incubation period of the virus will not enter the country. Americans who have not been through that territory for the past two weeks will also have to be quarantined.\nIran has cancelled all outward and return flights to China as a preventive measure against the outbreak of the new coronavirus. In a statement, the Iranian Civil Aviation Organisation spokesman Reza Jafarzadeh also announced that measures will be taken, which he did not specify, to transport Iranian passengers in China. At the international airport in Tehran, a group of doctors controls all passengers arriving from the countries of East Asia or regions where cases of infection with the new coronavirus have already been confirmed.\nYeah. If passengers with symptoms are detected, they are transported to quarantine centres,\nMacao's in minimum service. Schools, public services, cultural areas and deportees are now closed, trade is stalled and the two maritime links between Macao and Hong Kong are suspended, and the rest of them are expected to be reduced indefinitely as well. As the Express had already advanced, Macao Correctional Services Directorate announced the suspension from Sunday and also indefinitely of visits to prisoners and institutionalized youth. Many companies have also chosen to temporarily shut down or advise their employees to work remotely.\nVietnam cancelled the issuance of visas to tourists from China who represented one third of the total visitors to the territory last year. The government also set up a crisis committee to combine virus containment strategies and suspended all air links with China. However, the country is concerned about the economic impact of the outbreak and, like Thailand and Singapore, already prepares measures to minimise the economic impact of the outbreak in sectors such as tourism or exports.\nThailand is already missing tourists from the Asian giant. On Friday the government approved a package of measures, including temporary tax cuts and low-interest credit facilitation to help the tourist sector. Singapore authorities have recognised that the coronavirus outbreak will harm tourism and the economy, but the country has already closed its borders to Chinese travellers or who have been in China in the last 14 days, with the exception of residents with permanent residence or nationality\nYeah.\nIn India, which has been evacuating citizens on Chinese territory, passengers travelling to China recently are being watched for the typical symptoms caused by the new coronavirus at at at least twenty Indian airports. The country's Ministry of Health has put together a virus screening plan and strengthened the responsiveness of laboratories empowered to analyse suspicious cases.\nSome companies with presence or commercial relations with Chinese territory are also taking measures to prevent the spread of the coronary Chinese virus, restricting the movements of their employees to the territory or temporarily closing their stores in the country. Google and others have already announced limiting travel to the country.\nAmazon's boss, Jeff Bezos, announced that only critical travel is allowed and that company professionals returning from coronavirus-affected regions will have to work from home for two weeks before returning to the company offices. Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Apple are following similar protocols, the latter has already announced the temporary closure of their stores in China.\n",

No one's gonna be traced, this is done in origin. \"At the moment, no one better than China makes this detection,\" said this Friday afternoon the Director General of Health, Grace Freitas.\nThe Express questioned ANA Aeroports and the airline Beijing Capital to find out whether any additional security measures were envisaged or whether the possibility of this connection being suspended. Could not get any answer. On the Express, ANA only mentioned that \"it is monitoring the situation\", following \"the guidelines and recommendations received by this entity that are implemented immediately\".\nAs of now, there's no record of any coronavirus cases in Portugal.

He has symptoms of respiratory infection and is confined to St. John's hospital, where blood tests have been performed and are waiting for the results, which are being examined by the Ricardo Jorge Institute.\n\"This patient has returned from China on the 22nd day of January where he had contact with a citizen likely to be infected by 2019-nCoV [coronavirus] and is being sent to the St. John's University Hospital in Porto, a reference hospital for these situations\", said the DGS in a statement cited by Lusa\nYeah.\nDuring the afternoon of this Friday, the possibility of a suspicion was also reported at Cascais Hospital, which was denied the Express by that healthcare unit.\nAs for the 17 Portuguese that the state is picking up Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, there is still no forecast for the arrival in Portugal. The delay in authorising the Chinese authorities to leave the country delayed their return.\nWhen they land, the Director General of Health explained, they will be \"carefully\" evaluated. Grace Freitas also admitted that the Portuguese may be subject to \"voluntary quarantine\". \"It may be at home or in facilities that the Ministry of Health will make available but we are not absolutely sure if it will be the modality for special citizens who have been confined more than half days in the city where the epidemic appeared,\" he said. \"It doesn't mean they stay in, for logistical reasons they can take up facilities in hospitals.\"\nHowever, Spain confirmed the first case. According to the health authorities cited by El Pais, the case took place on the island La Gomera, which is part of the Canary Islands.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE: There are three new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in Singapore and none of them are linked to the existing cases or have been in China recently, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (Feb 7). \n This brings the number of cases in the country to 33. There are now at least four patients with no recent travel history to China or links to the other cases. \n  \n A teacher was among the three new cases announced, while one of the cases went visiting during Chinese New Year after developing symptoms, said MOH. \n Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that authorities are now expanding their case definition and doing \"proactive case finding\". \n \"This means never mind a connection to China. When they have pneumonia, I want to know if this is novel coronavirus. We are investigating more cases, so we are discovering more cases,\" said Mr Gan. \n At a press briefing on Friday, Singapore authorities raised the DORSCON (Disease Outbreak Response System Condition) code to Orange from Yellow. \n  \n This means the disease is deemed severe and spreads easily from person to person, but has not spread widely and is being contained. Moderate disruption is expected, due to measures such as quarantine and visitor restrictions at hospitals. \n  \n Seventeen of the 33 confirmed patients in Singapore were visitors from China, while another four are Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. \n  \n Twelve are locally transmitted, of which nine can be traced back to a group of Chinese tourists from Guangxi. \n Two patients are now in critical condition, said MOH. They are on breathing support and do not have any other significant medical problems, said MOH director of medical services Kenneth Mak. \n  \n Two patients have been discharged, while the remaining cases are stable or improving. The second discharged patient is a woman from Wuhan who was the second confirmed case in Singapore. \n Mr Mak said that experts around the world are working towards understanding the nature of the new coronavirus and its transmission patterns. \n \"All of us still recognise that the main form of spread remains by droplets and it is very important for us to recognise that most spread can occur through touch,\" he said. \n  \n This means touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face, mouth or eyes with contaminated hands. \n He added that there have been some reports of spread from people who have yet to develop symptoms but that the evidence today shows the rate of transmission is \"very low\". \n THREE NEW CASES \n On Friday, MOH said that two of the new cases had been to Malaysia prior to their diagnosis. \n Case 31, a 53-year-old Singaporean man, had been in Malaysia on Jan 6, 11 and 17, said MOH. \n He reported having symptoms on Jan 23, and visited two clinics before being admitted to Changi General Hospital (CGH) on Feb 1. He is currently warded in an isolation room at CGH. \n He lives at Tampines Street 24 and had been to the Life Church and Missions Singapore in Paya Lebar. He had visited friends and family during Chinese New Year. \n  \n Case 33, a 39-year-old Singaporean woman, had also been in Malaysia from Jan 22 to 29.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE: The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that infected more people in China than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 has now spread across the globe. \n While we are learning more about the virus daily, questions are being raised about its rapid spread. One possibility is that this development could be related to climatic conditions. \n CLIMATE, WEATHER AND FLU SEASONALITY \n There is reason to believe that the seasonal pattern of novel coronavirus pneumonia may be similar to that of influenza infection and SARS, and thus cases may sharply fall by May, when temperatures in China warm up. \n In countries with temperate climates such as China and the United States, the flu season usually starts in December with a peak in January or February, after which cases decrease. \n SARS disappeared in the northern summer of 2003 and has not reappeared significantly since. This seasonality of influenza and other respiratory viruses in temperate countries is thought to be related to factors that affect infectiousness (person to person spread) such as the dryness of the air, ambient air temperature and possibly ultraviolet solar radiation. \n Human factors may also contribute to the spread of influenza during the colder winters since more time may be spent indoors, presumably in closer contact with other persons. \n The 2019-nCoV appears to be similar to other respiratory viruses such as influenza or the common cold (rhinovirus), which are spread by large droplets of saliva or phlegm from one person to another (either directly by cough or sneeze) or by contact. That happens when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her nose, mouth or eyes, inadvertently transmitting the virus. \n In fact, studies have shown that these respiratory droplets spread farther when the air is cold and dry. \n Studies done many years ago showed that the “regular” coronavirus (which is one of the causes of the common cold) can survive on surfaces 30 times longer in places with a temperature of 6 degrees Celsius compared to those where the temperature is 20 degrees Celsius and humidity levels are high. \n More recently, scientists from Hong Kong University (HKU) including Professor Malik Peiris and Professor Seto Wing Hong showed that low temperatures and low relative humidity allowed the SARS virus to survive much longer than they would in high temperatures and humidity. \n  \n The HKU team argued that this may be the reason warm and humid Southeast Asian countries did not have SARS outbreaks, unlike Hong Kong and Singapore where in their words, there is “intensive use of air-conditioning”. \n Thus, just as with influenza, the 2019-nCoV may slow down when the sun starts to shine more and the weather warms up in temperate and subtropical countries. \n LESSONS FROM SARS \n The SARS epidemic occurred 17 years ago and, since then, public health institutions, medical and laboratory science professionals, and the infectious diseases community are much better prepared to respond to novel and emerging infections globally. \n The improvements in communications and social media are undeniable. The genetic sequence of this new type of severe pneumonia in Wuhan was shared relatively early. \n This allowed countries all over the world to develop fast and accurate tests: These were not available during the initial weeks of SARS outbreak. \n Then, we had to depend on clinical examinations and contact tracing to determine who really was infected with SARS. Near the end of the epidemic, we were able to test everyone and we found out that we had actually missed a significant number of cases – these were only diagnosed after they had recovered. \n This has been the biggest difference in that now, low-resourced countries like Nepal and Cambodia are able to conduct relatively fast and accurate diagnosis on-site without having to wait for samples to be sent overseas. \n Given that the genetic information about the novel coronavirus was available even before countries had patients with the virus, many labs in advanced countries, including Singapore, are already working on blood tests for rapid detection and studying the immune response to help vaccine development. A trial to test anti-viral treatments has already been initiated in China and is being planned elsewhere. \n CONTACT TRACING AND TRAVEL BANS \n A basic public health approach to any outbreak is the use of contact tracing. \n  \n This means that for any patient who is found to be ill, close family members and other persons that he or she had close contact with during the incubation period will be notified that they were exposed to a sick person and quarantined for a further full incubation period, which for this novel infection is indicated to be 14 days. \n During the Ebola virus outbreak of 2014, this type of contact tracing was done very manually in many settings, although there were a number of mobile applications which were piloted. \n For this 2019 virus infection outbreak, much effort is being placed on high-tech contact tracing. It is too early to tell if this will be more effective, but any method to help contacts monitor themselves during the incubation period and detect symptoms may certainly help to decrease community transmission. \n Public health measures including screening and quarantining are similar to what was done for SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), although there have been broader approaches to travellers without direct contact with infected patients because of the extent of community spread in China. \n Given that we are not sure as to what extent asymptomatic persons can transmit the virus, many countries have decided to close their borders to Chinese nationals, as they cannot rely on temperature screening to detect who is potentially contagious and necessitating quarantine. \n Many countries are also quarantining their own citizens and permanent residents returning from China, in an effort to limit introduction of this virus into the community. \n During SARS, the World Health Organization (WHO) imposed global travel restrictions and advisories. When a travel restriction is in effect, a country may feel the need to quickly get the ban lifted and reduce its aggressive screening and case finding. This may have contributed to the resurgence of SARS in Toronto after the initial period of good control. \n This time round, different countries have introduced their own travel restrictions which are probably more appropriate to the different situations and their relations with China. \n Travel bans are always controversial as they tend to have significant unintended consequences and have to be actually instituted before the virus appears in the country. Otherwise, they are relatively pointless. \n Among the concerns about the travel bans instituted this time during the coronavirus is the fact that we do not know how extensive the spread is from people without symptoms. \n  \n If this is really very widespread, then a blanket travel ban will have limited effects by now as the virus is probably silently spreading among and through most countries. Once there is documented local transmission in a country, as in Germany and the United States, the goal has to be containing the local transmission while at the same time preventing re-introduction of the virus. \n Overall, the key strategy has to be good contact tracing and widespread testing so that every case can be identified, tested and treated. That way the chain of transmission can be broken and the virus stopped in its tracks even before the warm weather kicks in. \n VACCINES AND DRUG TREATMENTS \n Unfortunately, the current way in which drug and vaccine development in modern medicine happens is very much driven by financial considerations. Unlike for example defence or homeland security, the question that always comes up when it comes to treating and preventing human disease is: “Is this financially viable?” \n As SARS disappeared 17 years ago and MERS has only occurred sporadically, primarily in the Middle East, there has been no incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to invest the funds needed to develop appropriate drugs and vaccines. \n All the interest and enthusiasm which came with SARS disappeared when the virus did not reappear after a couple of seasons. Governments had other priorities and most have actually left this part of national security to private industry. \n Hence, if and when the novel coronavirus disappears in May and does not reappear next October or November, we can predict that drug and vaccine development will likely die a natural death. \n That is unfortunately the way of the world and hopefully something can be done to change this. But that will require a massive global mindset change. Given the frequency with which these emerging viral infections occur, the world can ill- afford to continue along this road. \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram \n Assistant Professor Jyoti Somani, Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS and Professor Paul Ananth Tambyah, Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS and President, Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection. \n Editor's Note: A previous headline to this commentary referred to hot and dry climate.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "新加坡：在中国感染人数超过2003年爆发的严重急性呼吸综合征（SARS）的2019年新型冠状病毒（2019年nCoV）现已在全球蔓延。\n当我们每天都在学习更多关于病毒的知识时，人们对它的迅速传播提出了疑问。一种可能性是，这种发展可能与气候条件有关。\n气候、天气和流感季节性\n有理由相信，新型冠状病毒肺炎的季节模式可能与流感和非典型肺炎相似，因此，到5月份中国气温回升时，病例可能急剧下降。\n在中国和美国等气候温和的国家，流感季节通常从12月开始，高峰出现在1月或2月，之后病例减少。\n非典在2003年的北方夏季消失，此后再也没有出现过。在温带国家，流感和其他呼吸道病毒的季节性被认为与影响传染性（人与人之间传播）的因素有关，例如空气干燥、环境气温和可能的紫外线太阳辐射。\n在寒冷的冬季，人类因素也可能导致流感的传播，因为更多的时间可能花在室内，可能是与其他人更密切的接触。\n2019年的nCoV似乎与流感或普通感冒（鼻病毒）等其他呼吸道病毒相似，这些病毒通过大量唾液或痰从一个人传播到另一个人（直接通过咳嗽或打喷嚏）或通过接触传播。当一个人接触被污染的表面，然后触摸他的鼻子、嘴或眼睛，无意中传播病毒时，就会发生这种情况。\n事实上，研究表明，当空气寒冷干燥时，这些呼吸液滴传播得更远\n.\n多年前的研究表明，与温度为20摄氏度、湿度较高的地方相比，在温度为6摄氏度的地方，“常规”冠状病毒（普通感冒的原因之一）在表面上的存活时间要长30倍。\n最近，来自香港大学（HKU）的科学家们，包括Malik Peiris教授和Seto Wing Hong教授，发现低温和相对湿度使得SARS病毒比高温和潮湿时长得多。\n香港大学（UKU）小组辩称，这可能是东南亚湿热的国家没有SARS爆发的原因，不像香港和新加坡，他们的话是“集约使用空调”。\n因此，就像流感一样，2019年的nCoV可能会在太阳开始更亮，温带和亚热带国家的天气变暖时减慢。\n非典的教训\n非典疫情发生在17年前，此后，公共卫生机构、医学和实验室科学专业人员以及传染病界都做好了更好的准备，应对全球新出现的传染病。\n通信和社交媒体的进步是不可否认的。武汉地区这一新型重症肺炎的基因序列比较早。\n这使得世界各国都能快速而准确地进行检测：在SARS爆发的最初几周，这些检测是不可用的。\n然后，我们必须依靠临床检查和接触追踪来确定谁真的感染了SARS。在疫情接近尾声时，我们对每个人都进行了测试，结果发现我们确实漏掉了很多病例，这些病例只有在康复后才被诊断出来\n.\n这是最大的区别，现在，像尼泊尔和柬埔寨这样的低资源国家能够在现场进行相对快速和准确的诊断，而不必等待样本被送往海外。\n鉴于这种新型冠状病毒的基因信息甚至在各国有患者之前就已经可以获得，包括新加坡在内的许多先进国家的实验室已经在进行血液检测，以便快速检测和研究免疫反应，以帮助疫苗研制。中国已经开始试验抗病毒疗法，并计划在其他地方进行。\n联系追踪和旅行禁令\n任何疫情的基本公共卫生方法是使用接触追踪。\n这意味着，对于任何发现患病的患者，在潜伏期内与他或她有密切接触的亲密家庭成员和其他人将被告知他们接触了病人，并被隔离了一个完整的潜伏期，这一新的感染表明是14天。\n在2014年埃博拉病毒爆发期间，这种类型的接触者追踪在许多设置中都是非常手工完成的，尽管有许多移动应用程序已经试点。\n对于这场2019年的病毒感染疫情，人们正在大力进行高科技接触追踪。现在判断这是否会更有效还为时过早，但任何帮助接触者在潜伏期内自我监测和发现症状的方法都肯定有助于减少社区传播。\n包括筛查和隔离在内的公共卫生措施与针对SARS和中东呼吸综合征（MERS）所采取的措施相似，尽管由于中国社区的广泛传播，对没有直接接触感染患者的旅行者采取了更广泛的措施\n.\n鉴于我们不确定无症状者能在多大程度上传播这种病毒，许多国家已经决定对中国公民关闭边境，因为他们不能依靠温度检测来发现谁有潜在的传染性，需要隔离。\n许多国家还对本国公民和从中国返回的永久居民实施隔离，以限制这种病毒进入社区。\n在非典期间，世界卫生组织（世卫组织）实施了全球旅行限制和咨询。当旅行限制生效时，一个国家可能会感到有必要迅速解除禁令，并减少其积极的筛查和病例调查。这可能是多伦多非典在得到良好控制后重新抬头的原因之一。\n这一轮，不同国家出台了各自的旅行限制措施，可能更适合不同的情况和与中国的关系。\n旅行禁令总是有争议的，因为它们往往会产生重大的意外后果，而且必须在病毒出现在该国之前实施。否则，它们就相对毫无意义了。\n关于这次在冠状病毒爆发期间实施的旅行禁令的担忧之一是，我们不知道无症状人群的传播有多广泛。\n如果这种情况真的非常普遍，那么全面的旅行禁令到目前为止将产生有限的影响，因为病毒可能在大多数国家之间悄无声息地传播。一旦在一个国家（如德国和美国）有文件证明存在本地传播，目标必须是控制本地传播，同时防止病毒再次传入。\n总的来说，关键策略必须是良好的接触追踪和广泛的测试，以便每个病例都能被识别、测试和处理\n. 这样，病毒的传播链就可以被打破，病毒甚至在温暖的天气来临之前就停止了传播。\n疫苗和药物治疗\n不幸的是，目前现代医学中药物和疫苗开发的方式在很大程度上是由财政因素驱动的。与国防部或国土安全部不同，在治疗和预防人类疾病时总会出现的问题是：“这在财政上可行吗？”\n由于SARS在17年前消失，MERS只是偶尔发生，主要是在中东，制药行业没有动力投资开发适当药物和疫苗所需的资金。\n非典带来的所有兴趣和热情都消失了，因为病毒在几个季节后都没有再出现。各国政府有其他优先事项，而且大多数国家实际上把国家安全的这一部分留给了私营企业。\n因此，如果这种新型冠状病毒在5月份消失，并在明年10月或11月不再出现，我们可以预测，药物和疫苗的研发可能会自然死亡。\n不幸的是，这是世界的方式，希望能采取一些措施来改变这种状况。但这将需要一个大规模的全球思维转变。鉴于这些新出现的病毒感染的发生频率，世界无法承受继续沿着这条道路前进。\n下载我们的应用程序或订阅我们的Telegram频道获取武汉病毒爆发的最新更新：https://cna.asia/Telegram\n新南威尔士大学林永禄医学院医学部助理教授乔蒂·索马尼和新南威尔士大学林永禄医学院医学部保罗·阿南特·坦比耶教授，以及亚太临床微生物学与感染学会会长。\n编者按：这篇评论的前一个标题提到了炎热干燥的气候。已经编辑过了。我们为这个错误道歉。\n",

That helped the FTSE 100 climb 0.4% by 0841 GMT.\nOil majors Shell and BP were the biggest boosts to the blue-chip index, as they tracked a surge in crude prices.\nThe FTSE 250 added 0.6%, led by home furnishings retailer Dunelm which jumped 5.4% to a record high after upbeat profit forecast.\nOnline trading platform Plus500 also supported the mid-cap index with a 4.6% rise as its second-half core earnings nearly doubled from the first.\nFears over the coronavirus epidemic eased as new cases dropped and China’s senior medical adviser said on Tuesday that it may be over by April. However, some experts called for caution as the death toll in China crossed 1,100.\n“While there continues to be high uncertainty about the rate of spread and timing of the peak of the coronavirus, modelling by epidemiological experts indicates a likely range for the peak between late February and June,” analysts at S&P Global said.\nDealers also took note of comments overnight from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who remained fairly upbeat about the U.S. economy, but warned that the virus-led disruptions in China could spill over globally.\n“One can, in fact, make a bullish case for equities based on any scenario regarding COVID-19,” OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said.\n“An escalation in its spread causes a pronounced global slowdown, which prompts central banks to cut interest rates aggressively.

There is a fear that China is still hiding something.”\nThe yen JPY=EBS traded a tad higher at 109.79 per dollar on Friday in Asia, on course for its second day of gains.\nIn the offshore market, the yuan CNH=D3 was quoted at 6.9910, following a 0.2% decline on Thursday.\nHubei officials on Friday reported 4,823 new cases and 116 new deaths as of Feb. 13, but investors were still reeling after Hubei reported 14,840 new cases and a record daily increase in deaths on Thursday, using new diagnostic methods to reclassify a backlog of cases.\nChina’s economy will grow at its slowest rate since the financial crisis in the current quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists who said the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained.\nThe coronavirus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, a nerve centre in the global supply chain. It has so far claimed more than 1,300 lives in China and spread to 24 other countries.\nThe euro EUR=EBS fell 0.1% to $1.0827, the lowest since April 2017, as investors braced for the release of GDP data from Germany and the euro zone later on Friday.\nThe single currency EURCHF=EBS was quoted at 1.0614 Swiss francs, close to the lowest since August 2015. The euro EURGBP=D3 eased slightly to 83.06 pence, close to the weakest since December.\nSentiment for the euro worsened after data earlier this weak showing a plunge in euro zone manufacturing output reinforced expectations that monetary policy will remain accommodative.\nThe pound GBP=D3 was little changed at $1.3046 following a 0.64% gain on Thursday due to expectations that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's appointment of a new finance minister will lead to more fiscal spending to help Britain weather its transition away from the European Union.\n",

It has risen 4.8% since last Friday, its first weekly increase in six weeks.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) CLc1 was 70 cents or 1.4% higher at $52.12 a barrel, up 3.6% for the week.\n“It would seem in our view that the oil price is on a more positive footing in the past couple of days, with improved sentiment reflected in Asian equity prices holding up,” said BNP Paribas analyst Harry Tchilinguirian.\nMore than 1,350 people have died from the coronavirus in China, which has disrupted the world’s second largest economy and shaken energy markets. Brent has fallen 15% since the beginning of the year.\nHowever, market sentiment improved as factories in China started to reopen and the government eased its monetary policy.\nThe World Health Organization also reassured traders by saying the big jump in China’s reported cases reflected a decision by authorities to reclassify a backlog of suspected cases, and did not necessarily indicate a wider epidemic.\nSome officials and analysts were still hopeful that the demand impact would remain limited to China.\n“Our baseline thesis remains that oil demand destruction remains largely a China story and has yet to spill over to impact global demand,” said Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at Citadel Magnus.\nU.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette told Reuters the coronavirus epidemic in China had had a marginal impact on energy markets and was unlikely to dramatically affect oil prices even if Chinese demand fell by 500,000 barrels per day.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) said that first-quarter oil demand was set to fall versus a year earlier for the first time since the financial crisis in 2009 because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n“Given the strength seen in the market this week, it suggests participants were factoring in even larger demand hits as a result of COVID-19 (the coronavirus),” said ING analyst Warren Patterson.\n(Graphic: Chinese, World Oil Demand Growth, y-o-y -  here[1].jpg)\nIn response to the demand slump, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers, a grouping known as OPEC+, are considering cutting output by up to 2.3 million barrels per day.\n“The decision ultimately rests with the Kremlin, and if favourable, then we are likely to see a relief rally in oil, arguably mitigated by recent U.S. dollar strength,” said Tchilinguirian.\nUBS investment bank said in a note that commodity demand concerns were likely to linger and “the asset class should display a fair bit of volatility in the coming weeks”.\n“We assume China’s economic activity as well as commodity demand will recover from 2Q20 onwards,” it said, referring to the second quarter of 2020.\n(Graphic: OPEC crude supply - here)\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif./GENEVA (Reuters) - More than 300 American cruise liner passengers, including 14 who tested positive for coronavirus, were flown home to military bases in the United States after two weeks under quarantine off Japan.\nThe cruise ship Diamond Princess, which with more than 400 cases has by far the largest cluster outside China, has become the biggest test so far of other countries’ ability to contain an outbreak that has killed 1,772 people in China and five elsewhere.\nA ground crew in anti-contamination suits met the chartered jet that touched down at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, and passengers could be seen climbing down the stairs wearing face masks in the pre-dawn mist. Another flight landed at Travis Air Force Base in California hours earlier.\nAll the passengers were taken into a two-week quarantine.\nAlthough U.S. officials had said passengers with coronavirus symptoms would not be repatriated, 14 passengers found at the last minute to have tested positive were permitted to board the planes. The U.S. State Department said the infected passengers were exposed to other passengers for about 40 minutes before they were isolated.\nAcross mainland China, the total number of coronavirus cases rose by 2,051 to 70,635, according to the World Health Organization. That was slightly more new cases than were reported on Sunday, but hundreds fewer than reported on Saturday.\nChinese authorities say the decrease is a sign that measures taken to halt the spread of the disease are having an effect.\nHowever, epidemiologists say it is probably still too early to say how well the outbreak is being contained within China and its central Hubei province, where the virus first appeared. Official figures of new cases have leveled off in the past, only to jump suddenly after changes in methodology.\n“The real issue is whether we are seeing efficient community transmission outside of China and at the present time we are not observing that,” Mike Ryan, head of World Health Organization’s emergencies program, said at a news conference in Geneva.\nFewer than 700 cases have been reported in other countries and even within China the epidemic is affecting “a very tiny, tiny, tiny proportion of people,” Ryan said.\nChina has responded to the COVID-19 virus by locking down Hubei’s provincial capital Wuhan, a megacity of 11 million people, and imposing restrictions in a number of other cities.\nBut the ruling Communist Party is  under pressure to prevent the economy from crashing and to get people back to work.\nChina’s central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending on Monday, which is expected to pave the way for a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate on Thursday. Beijing has also announced plans for cuts in taxes and fees.\nEven so, economists expect China’s economic growth to slow. Ratings agency Moody’s on Monday lowered its 2020 GDP growth forecast to 5.2%, making it likely China would miss a goal to double GDP over the decade to 2020.\nAround half of all known cases of the virus outside China have been found aboard the Diamond Princess, which was ordered to stay under quarantine at the port of Yokohama on Feb. 3.\nSeveral other countries have announced plans to follow the United States in bringing passengers home. Around half of the 3,700 passengers and crew are Japanese.\nMatthew Smith, an American passenger who remained on the ship after refusing to board the voluntary repatriation flights, tweeted that staying behind was the “best decision ever”.\n“US Gov’t said they would not put anyone on the planes who was symptomatic, and they ended up knowingly and intentionally putting on 14 people who actually have the virus,” he wrote.\nAuthorities around the world were also trying to track down passengers from another cruise liner, the Westerdam, which was turned away from ports across Southeast Asia for two weeks before docking in Cambodia on Thursday.\nOne American passenger who disembarked in Cambodia tested positive for the virus in Malaysia on Saturday.\nCarnival Corp, which operates both cruise liners, said it was cooperating with authorities in trying to trace other passengers from the Westerdam. None of the other 1,454 passengers and 802 crew had reported any symptoms, it said.\nHundreds of passengers are still in Cambodia, either on the ship or in hotels.\nHolly Rauen, a passenger from Fort Myers, Florida, said she and others will be tested by Cambodian authorities. “We have no idea when we get to get home,” she said.\nAfter an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China needs to get back to work or will suffer severe economic consequences. There is a proposal to delay the opening of the annual session of parliament, due on Feb. 24.\nSome cities remain in lockdown, streets are deserted, employees are nervous, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country. Many factories have yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond.\nIn Japan, where data showed on Monday that the economy had already shrunk last quarter at the fastest pace in almost six years, the impact of the virus is expected to show up in the current quarter, stoking fears of recession.\nTrade-dependent Singapore downgraded its 2020 economic growth forecast and has said recession is possible. It is set to unveil measures to cushion the blow on Tuesday.\nOrganisers of the Tokyo Marathon have decided to limit the March 1 race to top-level athletes, banning 38,000 general participants, a person with knowledge of the issue told Reuters.\nJapan’s Imperial Household Agency said it would cancel Emperor Naruhito’s public birthday address on Feb. 23, his first since his coronation last year. The event regularly attracts tens of thousands of people to the inner grounds of the Imperial Palace in the heart of Tokyo.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "By Melati Mohd AriffThis is a round-up of COVID-19 related matters in Malaysia and globally from Feb 10 to 14.Update as at 5.30pm: Total number of patients who have recovered in Malaysia and Indonesia's first possible COVID-19 case.Kuala Lumpur (Bernama ) -- The number of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia remains at 19 today at the time of writing since the first case was reported on Jan 25.Out of the 19 cases, six are Malaysians while the remaining 13 are Chinese citizens.Today, four more patients, all Chinese nationals, in Malaysia were reported to have recovered, bringing the total number of people who have recovered to seven. Today's cases comprised a 65-year-old woman, her daughter-in-law, 36, and two grandchildren aged 11 and two.  The three patients who had recovered earlier, also Chinese nationals, were two men aged 63 and 40 and a four-year-old girl.Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad was earlier (on Feb 12) quoted as saying that the spread of the COVID-19 virus infection remained under control and that the country was in the early containment phase.Responding to a statement issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO), he said Malaysia had stepped up its preparations earlier in the event of wider transmission of COVID-19.WHO regional director for the Western Pacific Dr Takeshi Kasai told all countries, including Malaysia, to prepare for the possibility of a wider transmission of the COVID-19 virus.He said the region was at a \"critical juncture\" following reports of COVID-19 positive cases with no link to China.Meanwhile, it was reported today that a 19-year-old student from Sifnana village, Tanimbar Islands, Maluku in Indonesia has been quarantined after showing symptoms of COVID-19.The student had reportedly visited Malaysia and will be quarantined for 14 days while awaiting the test results.COVID-19 was previously identified as the Wuhan virus or 2019-nCoV and it was first detected in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China, on Dec 31, 2019.WHO announced the official name of the virus (COVID-19) on Feb 11 at a news conference at its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. COVID-19 is the acronym for coronavirus 2019 – CO stands corona, VI for virus and D for disease.WHO also announced that the first vaccine for COVID-19 could be available in 18 months and stressed that the disease should be seen as \"public enemy number one\".On Feb 11, Malaysia and Singapore agreed to form a joint working committee to address the COVID-19 outbreak more effectively and share information on public health, medication and research.Dr Dzulkefly said the committee would be led by his deputy Dr Lee Boon Chye and Dr Lee's counterpart from Singapore. ADVICE FOR THE PUBLICMeanwhile, the public has been advised not to shake hands but practice the 'Salaam Malaysia' gesture when greeting people to prevent the spread of COVID-19.Dr Lee said the gesture – placing the right hand over the heart area of the chest – would prevent people from touching each other, thus reducing the possibility of contracting the virus.Despite the stern warning from the police and Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission that action will be taken against those who spread fake news or rumours with regard to COVID-19, police have opened another investigation paper in relation to this matter, bringing the number of such cases to 23 so far.Bukit Aman Criminal Investigation Department (Intelligence and Operations) deputy director Datuk Mohd Roze Shaari said the new investigation paper involved a case in Tumpat, Kelantan.So far three cases have been brought to court, one each in Kuala Lumpur, Terengganu and Sabah. GLOBAL STATISTICS According to the latest statistics taken from the Ministry of Health's website, the total number of COVID-19 cases worldwide currently stands at 64,267 covering 25 countries and the total number of deaths 1,489.  Reuters reported yesterday that China's Hubei province recorded 242 deaths on Wednesday (Feb 12), so far the highest number of deaths reported in a single day. Hubei's Health Commission also reported 14,840 new COVID-19 positive cases on the same day.Apart from one death in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines that occurred last week, Japan announced one death yesterday. The Japan Times quoted Health Minister Katsunobu Kato as saying that the patient who died was a woman in her 80s who hailed from Kanagawa region in the southwest of Tokyo.Japan has 33 cases of domestic infection; however, some 218 people on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which has been docked at the port in Yokohama since early February, have also been tested positive for COVID-19.Besides China and Japan, others in the top 10 countries with the highest number of infections are Singapore 58 cases, Thailand 33, South Korea 28, Malaysia 19, Germany 16, Vietnam 16, Australia 15, United States 15 and France 11. Yesterday, AFP reported that several villages in Vietnam with about 10,000 people situated close to the nation's capital were placed under quarantine yesterday after six cases of COVID-19 were discovered there.On Feb 11, media reports from Wuhan stated that new research based on data gathered from more than 1,000 COVID-19 patients in China found that the incubation period for the virus was as long as 24 days rather than the previously believed 14 days.The study, carried out by about 36 researchers from Chinese hospitals and medical schools, found that less than half of the patients showed fever symptoms when they first saw a doctor.Head of the research team Dr Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese epidemiologist who discovered the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, was quoted as saying that much is still unknown about COVID-19.Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and breathing difficulty. In more severe cases, the infection can lead to lung inflammation, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. COVID-19 BACKGROUNDAccording to the WHO website, its China country office was informed of cases of pneumonia that were detected in Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019. On Jan 7, the Chinese authorities confirmed that the novel coronavirus can be transmitted from human to human.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV).A study of the virus' genetic sequence suggested similarities to that seen in snakes and bats.China health officials identified the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan as the source of the transmission of the coronavirus.Besides Malaysia, COVID-19 has spread to Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Vietnam, Germany, United States, France, Macau, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Russia, Spain, Finland, Cambodia, Sweden, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Belgium.On Jan 30, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak as a global emergency. By then, it had spread to 18 countries and caused 170 deaths.The declaration was aimed at preventing or reducing transmissions across borders.With 1,489 deaths worldwide as of today, COVID-19 has overtaken SARS which caused 774 deaths in 2003. Translated by Rema NambiarBERNAMA \r\n    \r\n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "\nIndia has despatched a C-17 Globesmart, the largest military aircraft in its fleet, to bring back on Friday the remaining 100 or so Indians left in Wuhan. Air India has already evacuated more than 600 Indians from the city.\nAt present we don't know what time the flight is coming. The only thing we know is that we are going to leave Wuhan tomorrow. We are only hoping that we come back to India soon.\nAll the buildings around my home are sealed. In fact, a university hostel close to my building has been converted into an isolation ward.\nMy Chinese neighbours are helping me to get food and drinking water.\nI have not spoken face to face with anyone since January 22. There are only nine of us in our building and they all are Chinese.\nLike us, they also stay indoors all the time. The fear is so palpable that no one steps out and talks to one another. Each of us thinks the other is positive for coronavirus.\nThe Chinese government hasn't ordered people not to interact, but the atmosphere of fear lingers heavily all over.\nThe Chinese authorities have asked people not to walk in groups and try to remain solitary.\nThe person who delivers food to us messages on the WeChat app and then at a decided time he drops food at the main gate of our building. We are not allowed to go and pick up the food immediately. After the delivery boy leaves, we are allowed to leave our flat after 30 minutes and pick up our order. This is a rule that everyone has to follow in the university campus.\nThe delivery boy fears we might have coronavirus and we, on the other hand, fear that the delivery boy must be carrying coronavirus so it is a cycle of fear where everyone fears each other. We are keeping a distance from everyone.\nOn January 24, I tried to walk around our campus. I saw a man walking towards me, but suddenly he changed direction, fearing he would contract the virus.\nI don't know how far things have improved in Wuhan. Yesterday, one Chinese news article stated that water in our pipes might be contaminated with coronavirus. I have no idea whether this is true or not. And therefore we have stopped using tap water too. We used to boil tap water and drink, but now we depend on bottled water.\nI have stopped watching the news because I get more worried after watching the news. I don't feel like working too. And even if I call my family back home, how long can I talk?\nI keep fearing the worst every time I feel feverish or sneeze leading to many sleepless nights.\nIf that wasn't enough, when you go to any store to buy medicines for fever, the employees inform the doctors and you are forced to go to hospital for a check-up.\nEarlier, they would check our body temperature every two hours to find out whether I have contracted coronavirus or not; that routine changed to one day a week and now they have stopped that.\nI believe we are in the safe zone now.\nRumour mongering regarding coronavirus is very rampant.\nSome say inhaling dust particles could lead to being tested positive, forcing many to shut their windows. However, how long can one stay in an air-conditioned room?\nWe cannot even dry our clothes as we have to keep all our wet clothes inside the room because we now fear coronavirus might enter through air.\nThe Chinese government is cracking down on people who are spreading rumours and till date 15,000 people have been arrested. The government is trying its best to control rumours, but they refuse to die.\nAnother rumour was that garlic water was a cure for coronavirus. The other was that if one drank whiskey or wine you wouldn't be affected by the virus. This resulted in a rise in sale of whiskey and wine. Soon, there was no whiskey and wine was available in Wuhan.\nI had a miscarriage and returned home on January 22. On that very day, the entire city of Wuhan was shut down.\nI am thankful that I came back on January 22 or else I would have been confined to a hospital which would have been worse.\nThe worst day for me was when the doctors came to our home to check whether we were infected with coronavirus or not. There were 10 of them, all dressed up like astronauts.\nI cried and cried because I felt if I am found positive for coronavirus I would die in China and never see my country again.\nLuckily, I was not positive. And rumours spread so fast on the university campus that we were detected with coronavirus which was untrue.\nThe only way to spend our time is the WeChat group all the Indians staying in Wuhan have formed. We have become friends as we are all in the same boat.\nEvery day we feel the Air India flight will come, but it has not come yet.\nWe have run out of food and we don't have flour. We are only eating rice. There is no bread, butter or jam too.\nWe have stopped eating breakfast and eat lunch at 11 am.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Scientists can't tell yet how deadly the new virus that's spreading around the globe really is - and deepening the mystery, the fatality rate differs even within China.\nAs infections of the virus that causes COVID-19 surge in other countries, even a low fatality rate can add up to lots of victims, and understanding why one place fares better than another becomes critical to unravel.\n\"You could have bad outcomes with this initially until you really get the hang of how to manage\" it, Dr. Bruce Aylward, the World Health Organization envoy who led a team of scientists just back from China, warned Tuesday.\nWHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE DEATH RATE?\nIn the central China city of Wuhan, where the new coronavirus first exploded, 2 per cent to 4 per cent of patients have died, according to WHO. But in the rest of hard-hit China, the death rate was strikingly lower, 0.7 per cent.\nThere's nothing different about the virus from one place to another. Instead, the never-before-seen strain of coronavirus struck Wuhan fast - before anyone knew what the illness was - and overwhelmed health facilities. As is usual at the beginning of an outbreak, the first patients were severely ill before they sought care, Aylward said.\nBy the time people were getting sick in other parts of China, authorities were better able to spot milder cases - meaning there were more known infections for each death counted.\nAnd while there are no specific treatments for COVID-19, earlier supportive care may help, too. China went from about 15 days between onset of symptoms and hospitalisation early in the outbreak, to about three days more recently.\nStill, Aylward expressed frustration at people saying: \"'Oh, the mortality rate's not so bad because there's way more mild cases.' Sorry, the same number of people that were dying, still die.\"\nWHAT ABOUT DEATHS OUTSIDE OF CHINA?\nUntil the past week, most people diagnosed outside of China had become infected while traveling there.\nPeople who travel generally are healthier and thus may be better able to recover, noted Johns Hopkins University outbreak specialist Lauren Sauer. And countries began screening returning travelers, spotting infections far earlier in places where the medical system wasn't already strained.\nThat's now changing, with clusters of cases in Japan, Italy and Iran, and the death toll outside of China growing.\nAylward cautioned that authorities should be careful of \"artificially high\" death rates early on: Some of those countries likely are seeing the sickest patients at first and missing milder cases, just like Wuhan did.\nHOW DOES COVID-19 COMPARE TO OTHER DISEASES?\nA cousin of this new virus caused the far deadlier severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, and about 10 per cent of SARS patients died.\nFlu is a different virus family, and some strains are deadlier than others. On average, the death rate from seasonal flu is about 0.1 per cent, said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\nThat's far lower than what has been calculated so far for COVID-19. But millions of people get the flu every year around the world, leading to an annual death toll in the hundreds of thousands.\nWHO'S MOST AT RISK FROM COVID-19?\nOlder people, especially those with chronic illnesses such as heart or lung diseases, are more at risk.\nAmong younger people, deaths are rarer, Aylward said. But some young deaths have made headlines, such as the 34-year-old doctor in China who was reprimanded by communist authorities for sounding an early alarm about the virus only to later succumb to it.\nIn China, 80 per cent of patients are mildly ill when the virus is detected, compared with 13 per cent who already are severely ill. While the sickest to start with are at highest risk of death, Aylward said, a fraction of the mildly ill do go on to die - for unknown reasons.\nOn average, however, WHO says people with mild cases recover in about two weeks, while those who are sicker can take anywhere from three to six weeks.\n",

European equities markets suffered their biggest slump since mid-2016, gold soared to a seven-year high and oil tumbled 4%.\nThe Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 posted their biggest one-day percentage drops in over two years and Nasdaq had one of its worst days since December 2018. All three indexes closed down more than 3% after notching record highs last week on optimism the coronavirus would not seriously hurt global economies.\nWall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index , jumped to a one-year high.\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the word “pandemic” did yet not fit the facts.\n“We must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic,” he told reporters in Geneva, adding that the world was not witnessing an uncontained spread or large-scale deaths.\nThe epidemic in China peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining since, the WHO said.\nDr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO’s emergencies program, told reporters it was still possible to contain the virus and that it might appear each year like the flu.\n“The virus may settle down into an endemic pattern of transmission, into a seasonal pattern of transmission, or it could accelerate into a full-blown global pandemic,” he said in Geneva on Monday. “And at this point, it is not possible to say which of those realities is going to happen.”\nIn the United States, the White House is considering asking lawmakers for emergency funding to ramp up its response to the fast-spreading virus, a White House spokesman and an administration source said on Monday. Politico and the Washington Post had reported the Trump administration may request $1 billion.\nLiang Wannian of China’s National Health Commission said while the rapid rise had been halted, the situation was still grim. He said over 3,000 medical staff had become infected, most in Hubei province surrounding Wuhan, probably due to the lack of protective gear and fatigue.\nExcluding Hubei, mainland China reported 11 new cases, the lowest since the national health authority started publishing nationwide daily figures on Jan. 20.\nOverall, China reported 409 new cases on the mainland, down from 648 a day earlier. That took the total number of cases to 77,150, while the death toll rose by 150 to 2,592.\nThere was a measure of relief for the world’s second-largest economy as more than 20 province-level jurisdictions, including Beijing and Shanghai, reported zero new infections.\nOutside mainland China, the outbreak has spread to some 29 countries and territories, with a death toll of about two dozen, according to a Reuters tally.\nSouth Korea reported 231 new cases, taking its total to 833. Many are in its fourth-largest city, Daegu, which became more isolated with Asiana Airlines (020560.KS) and Korean Air (003490.KS) suspending flights there until next month.\nKuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Afghanistan and Iraq reported their first new coronavirus cases, all in people who had been to Iran, where the toll was 12 dead and 61 infected.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Researchers want to know everything about the latest coronavirus, from its mortality rate to its origins, incubation period and much more, and they still have blanks to fill in.\nMortality rate?\nCOVID-19, as the disease is known, is more lethal than the average seasonal flu, but less so than previous epidemics stemming from coronaviruses. We do not yet know its precise mortality rate.\nWorld Health Organization data released on Saturday identified 2 348 deaths from 76 392 confirmed cases in China, for a rough rate of 3.07 percent.\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) this week published a study of 72 314 confirmed, clinically diagnosed or suspected cases as of February 11.\nAccording to the most extensive study done so far, the novel coronavirus was benign in 80.9 percent of the cases, \"serious\" in 13.8 percent and \"critical\" in 4.7 percent.\nThe remaining 0.6 percent was not specified.\nALSO READ | South Korea coronavirus cases spike, as Italy and Iran take drastic steps\nAccording to the China CDC study, the mortality rate increased substantially with age, and those over 80 were most at risk with a rate of 14.8 percent.\nPatients who already suffered from cardiovascular diseases were also particularly at risk, ahead of diabetics and those who suffered from chronic respiratory diseases or hypertension.\nGlobal estimates of the mortality rate are risky however because we do not know how many people have actually been infected.\nOther strains of coronavirus, such as SARS and Mers, have established mortality rates of 9.5 percent and 34.5 percent, respectively.\nHow infectious is it?\nSpecialists generally agree that each person who falls ill with coronavirus will infect between two and three others on average.\nThat is a higher rate than a typical winter flu (1.3), lower than an infectious disease such as measles (more than 12), and comparable to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS (3) - the last major virus that broke out in China, in 2002-03.\nSome experts warn, however, that we might be seriously underestimating the number of cases.\nA study published Friday by the Imperial College Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis said: \"We estimated that about two thirds of COVID-19 cases exported from mainland China have remained undetected worldwide, potentially resulting in multiple chains of as yet undetected human-to-human transmission outside mainland China.\"\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus voiced concern on Friday about \"the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link, such as travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case.\"\nAsymptomatic cases, where people show no symptoms, are another cause for concern.\nThe incubation period is estimated to be two to 10 days, and has led experts to decide on an observation period of 14 days for suspected cases or for people who have been repatriated from areas such as China's Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak.\nHow is it transmitted?\nThe virus is mainly transmitted by respiratory means and physical contact. Drops of saliva expelled when an infected person coughs is a common example, and researchers believe that generally occurs over a distance of around one metre (yard) at most.\nHealth advisories emphasise measures such as washing your hands often, coughing or sneezing into the crook of your elbow or a paper handkerchief, and wearing a mask if you know you have been infected.\nA secondary means of transmission might be diarrhoea.\nWhat are the symptoms and treatments?\nWHO says: \"Signs and symptoms include respiratory symptoms and include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome and sometimes death.\"\nThere are no vaccines or medications at present to fight COVID-19, so health officials can only treat the symptoms.\nSome patients are given anti-viral medications, but their effectiveness has not been established so far.\nWhere did it come from?\nThe novel coronavirus is believed to have come from bats, but researchers think it might have spread to humans via another mammal species.\nChinese researchers suspect that might be the pangolin, a widely trafficked and endangered mammal.\nThe global scientific community deems that hypothesis plausible, but still awaits confirmation.\n",

He has sought to downplay the effects of the virus, saying it could fade in April with warmer weather - something health experts said is unknown.\nTrump has praised the work of Chinese President Xi Jinping, even as his advisers have questioned the reliability of the information Beijing has shared on the virus and expressed frustration over its reluctance to accept US expertise in combating it.\nThe Trump administration is also grappling with where to send Americans evacuated from the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the virus after backing off plans to quarantine them in a federal facility in Alabama.\nIn a statement on Monday, the Department of Heath and Human Services cited a \"rapidly evolving situation\", but said the Alabama centre was \"not needed at this time\" and that it was looking for alternatives.\n",

A continued output decline in the automotive industry, which accounts for about one fifth of BASF’s business, was tempering moderate growth in most other customer industries, it added.\nAdjusted EBIT increased by 23% to 765 million euros in the fourth quarter ended December, beating analysts’ projections thanks to a stronger-than-expected agriculture business.\nBASF said it was speeding up a program of cutbacks that started last year and will see the reduction of 6,000 jobs. The group is now eyeing 1.3-1.5 billion euros in cost cuts this year, more than the 1-1.3 billion initially targeted.\nSpending on plants and equipment would be “disciplined” this year, it added, with the investment budget edging higher to 3.4 billion euros from 3.3 billion last year as it builds sites in Guangdong, China and Mundra, India and seeks to boost battery materials output.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "DAEGU/SEOUL, South Korea (Reuters) - An So-young had a gut feeling that the 31st person in South Korea to test positive for the coronavirus might be a member of the controversial religious sect she quit four years ago.\nThe person, dubbed “Patient 31,” was the first of an explosive wave of cases that made South Korea’s outbreak the largest outside of China. What caught An’s attention was how health authorities were struggling to track the woman’s movements before she was tested.\n“That’s their culture, they have to hide their movements, and that’s why I guessed she was with Shincheonji,” An, 27, said in an interview, referring to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.\nPatient 31 attended services at the church’s branch in the southeastern city of Daegu this month, staying for two hours each time, before testing positive on Feb. 18.\nThe South Korean disease control chief Jeong Eun-kyeong said the church’s services, where thousands of people sit on the floor, shoulder-to-shoulder, for hours, could have contributed to the surges.\n“You would be 5 centimeters away from the person who sits next to you, and have to say ‘Amen’ after every sentence the pastor speaks - it’s the best environment for the virus to spread,” said An, who is now a theology student.\nIn a media interview, Patient 31 said she did not refuse to be tested. But health authorities said she sought care at a traditional medicine hospital in Daegu after a minor car accident, where a medical worker who treated her later tested positive for the virus. While running a fever, she went to a buffet at a hotel and the church services.\nShincheonji is in the biggest crisis in its 36-year history, as hundreds of members have tested positive for the virus, SARS-CoV-2. All of its 210,000 known followers are being tested amid unprecedented scrutiny from authorities and the public.\nAfter initial resistance, the church released the addresses of 1,100 facilities around the country - 82 churches and 1,018 “affiliates,” - and asked the public to avoid making “groundless criticism.” It was the “biggest victim of the virus,” it said.\nCalls by Reuters to the church’s headquarters seeking comment went unanswered.\nDuring a visit to the Daegu branch on Friday, a man who identified himself as a member said he was the only one there and told Reuters that “all of our 9,000 members are taking self-quarantine measures in compliance with the government instruction.” He said the building was disinfected twice last week.\nInteractive graphic about the spread of coronavirus inside South Korea: here\nSouth Korea reported 334 new cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, bringing the national tally to 1,595. More than 1,000 are from Daegu, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), and nearly 600 are directly linked to Shincheonji’s branch there.\nKCDC said that it is still investigating the exact origin of the outbreak, but that five or six other members of the church were infected together with Patient 31.\nThe church had a presence in Wuhan, the center of the virus in China, according to the KCDC, though it is unclear whether that played a role.\nAlso known as the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, the church was founded and is headed by self-proclaimed messiah Lee Man-hee.\n“This disease case is the devil’s deed to stop the rapid growth of Shincheonji,” Lee said in a message on Friday on an internal app used by members.\nBut its secretive practices and often-aggressive recruitment tactics have made the church a controversial presence in South Korea’s religious community.\nNew members are forced to leave home and live in dormitories as part of initiation. Many break ties with their family and begin aggressively recruiting new members, An said.\nAccording to its website, followers must undergo six months of classes and complete a demanding written exam before “graduating” and joining the church.\nThe church has denied previous reports by Christian news organizations describing it as a “brainwashing cult”, calling those accusations “blatant lies” and a plot to rein in its expansion.\nAll members work as “harvesters” tasked with courting new followers from other churches, dubbed “harvest fields”, former members said.\n“It may appear Christian, but is actually completely different. They revere founder Lee Man-hee as a saviour, like Jesus,” said Lee Duck-sure, a Christian pastor who runs a counseling center in Seoul for former members of Shincheonji.\nSouth Koreans vented anger after an official at a Daegu public health center that carries out virus tests continued to work even after he was told to get tested. He revealed he was a member of the Daegu Shincheonji church only after the test showed he was infected, Daegu officials said.\nBut health officials and experts cautioned the blame should not be focused on the church and its believers, saying they were also victims.\nKCDC is also looking into links between the church and a hospital in nearby Cheongdo County, which reported the second-highest number of patients in the country with more than 110.\nThe county is a holy site for Shincheonji believers as the birthplace of Lee, and recently a funeral for his older brother was held at that hospital.\nOn a recent visit, the Daegu church was shuttered and silent, surrounded by empty streets and closed stores. Someone had thrown eggs at the front gate of the building.\nSon, who did not want to give her full name and lives in the neighborhood, said many believers, especially young women, have moved to live near the church, and several restaurants are run by members.\nDoo Song-Ja, 64, said she had not heard from her daughter since 2015, when she joined the church.\n“I’m so worried because so many Shincheonji followers are testing positive but I don’t know where she is,” said Doo, who said her 33-year-old daughter had sued her for “forcible confinement” for trying to keep her home. “I just hope she is OK.”\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "A man has died in Washington state of COVID-19, state health officials said Saturday, marking the first such reported death in the United States.\nState officials issued a terse news release announcing the death, gave no details and scheduled a news conference. A spokesperson for EvergreenHealth Medical Center, Kayse Dahl, said the person died in the facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, but gave no other details.\nState and King County health officials said \"new people (have been) identified with the infection, one of whom died.\" They did not say how many new cases there are.\nAmy Reynolds of the Washington state health department said in a brief telephone interview: \"We are dealing with an emergency evolving situation.\"\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee said the person who died was a man from Washington state.\n\"It is a sad day in our state as we learn that a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to his family and friends,\" Inslee said. \"We will continue to work toward a day where no one dies from this virus.\nThe number of coronavirus cases in the United States is considered small. Worldwide, the number of people sickened by the virus hovered Friday around 83,000, and there were more than 2,800 deaths, most of them in China.\nMost infections result in mild symptoms, including coughing and fever, though some can become more serious and lead to pneumonia. Older people, especially those with chronic illnesses such as heart or lung disease, are especially vulnerable. Health officials think it spreads mainly from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads.\nHealth officials in California, Oregon and Washington state worried about the novel coronavirus spreading through West Coast communities after confirming three patients were infected by unknown means.\nThe patients - an older Northern California woman with chronic health conditions, a high school student in Everett, Washington, and an employee at a Portland, Oregon-area school - hadn't recently traveled overseas or had any known close contact with a traveler or an infected person, authorities said.\nEarlier U.S. cases include three people who were evacuated from the central China city of Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak; 14 people who returned from China, or their spouses; and 42 American passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, who were flown to U.S. military bases in California and Texas for quarantining.\nConvinced that the number of cases will grow but determined to keep them from exploding, health agencies were ramping up efforts to identify patients.\nThe California Department of Public Health said Friday that the state will receive enough kits from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to test up to 1,200 people a day for the COVID-19 virus - a day after Gov. Gavin Newsom complained to federal health officials that the state had already exhausted its initial 200 test kits.\nSanta Clara County in the San Francisco Bay Area reported two cases where the source of infection wasn't known. The older woman was hospitalized for a respiratory illness, and rapid local testing confirmed in one day that she had the virus, health officials said.\n\"This case represents some degree of community spread, some degree of circulation,\" said Dr. Sara Cody, health officer for Santa Clara County and director of the County of Santa Clara Public Health Department.\n\"But we don't know to what extent,\" Cody said. \"It could be a little, it could be a lot.\"\n\"We need to begin taking important additional measures to at least slow it down as much as possible,\" she said.\nCody said the newly confirmed case in Santa Clara County is not linked to two previous cases in that county, nor to others in the state.\nThe Santa Clara County resident was treated at a local hospital and is not known to have traveled to Solano County, where another woman was identified Wednesday as having contracted the virus from an unknown source.\nDozens of people had close contact with the Solano County woman. They were urged to quarantine themselves at home, while a few who showed symptoms of illness were in isolation, officials said.\nAt UC Davis Medical Center at least 124 registered nurses and other health care workers were sent home for \"self-quarantine\" after the Solano County woman with the virus was admitted, National Nurses United, a nationwide union representing RNs, said Friday.\nThe case \"highlights the vulnerability of the nation's hospitals to this virus,\" the union said.\nEarlier Friday, Oregon confirmed its first coronavirus case, a person who works at an elementary school in the Portland area, which will be temporarily closed.\nThe Lake Oswego School District sent a robocall to parents saying that Forest Hills Elementary will be closed until Wednesday so it can be deep-cleaned by maintenance workers.\nWashington state health officials announced two new coronavirus cases Friday night, including a high school student who attends Jackson High School in Everett, said Dr. Chris Spitters of the Snohomish County Health District.\nThe other case in Washington was a woman in in King County in her 50s who had recently traveled to South Korea, authorities said.\nBoth patients weren't seriously ill.\nBut health officials aren't taking any chances. Some communities, including San Francisco, already have declared local emergencies in case they need to obtain government funding.\nIn Southern California's Orange County, the city of Costa Mesa went to court to prevent state and federal health officials from transferring dozens of people exposed to the virus aboard a cruise ship in Japan to a state-owned facility in the city. The passengers, including some who tested positive for the virus and underwent hospital care, had been staying at Travis Air Force Base in Northern California.\nOn Friday, state officials said the federal decided it no longer had a crucial need to move those people to the Fairview Developmental Center in Costa Mesa. That's because of the imminent end of the isolation period for those passengers and the relatively small number of persons who ended up testing positive, officials said.\nThe new coronavirus cases of unknown origin marks an escalation of the worldwide outbreak in the U.S. because it means the virus could spread beyond the reach of preventative measures like quarantines, though state health officials said that was inevitable and that the risk of widespread transmission remains low.\nFederal officials think the coronavirus is spread only through \"close contact, being within 6 feet of somebody for what they're calling a prolonged period of time,\" said Dr. James Watt, interim state epidemiologist at the California Department of Public Health.\nPeter Beilenson, Sacramento County's health services director, said he expects even those who test positive to become only mildly ill.\n",

Latvia, Saudi Arabia, Senegal and Morocco reported cases for the first time, bringing the total to more than 60 countries with the illness known as COVID-19.\nBut equity markets surged after their worst plunge since the 2008 financial crisis last week, encouraged by the prospect of government action to stem the economic impact.

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. public health officials said they have identified four “presumptive” coronavirus cases believed to have emerged from community transmission of the infection, signaling a turning point in efforts to contain the disease in the United States.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a statement on Friday citing three such cases newly diagnosed by state public health authorities - one each in California, Oregon and Washington state.\nIf confirmed by the CDC, together with a previous case of unknown origin announced on Wednesday in California, that would bring to four the number of diagnosed individuals in the United States with no history of travel to a country where the virus is circulating and no close contact with an infected person.\nThe three latest patients were diagnosed based on results obtained in their respective states from CDC-supplied test kits and are considered “presumptive positive” cases pending CDC confirmatory testing, the U.S. agency said.\nA fourth presumptive positive was also announced in Washington state on Friday, but that one is “likely travel-related,” the CDC said.\nStill, the three latest cases of apparent community transmission, plus the one identified earlier this week in California, are a sign the virus is now spreading within at least four separate locations up and down the U.S. West Coast.\nThey span nearly 900 miles from California’s Silicon Valley region in Santa Clara County north to the Puget Sound near Seattle.\n“What we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level, but we still don’t know to what degree,” said Dr. Sara Cody, the chief public health officer for Santa Clara County, speaking of the newly diagnosed case there, the latest of three in her county and the 10th statewide.\nEven as confirmation was pending there, the CDC sent a team to assist local authorities in tracing close contacts the patient had with others in a bid to curb transmission.\nUntil this week, the CDC had counted 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the U.S. public health system since Jan. 21, none fatal. Most were contracted by individuals while traveling in China, where the outbreak originated. Only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples.\nAn additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated from abroad, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan or from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, according to the CDC.\nThe latest flurry of cases came as the Trump administration said the United States would invoke a federal defense law to boost production of masks, gloves, gowns and other items needed to protect medical personnel from exposure.\nAround the world, more countries are reporting new infections, companies have curtailed travel and global stock markets have tumbled.\nPresident Donald Trump said at the White House on Friday the United States will decide “very soon” about whether to bar entry to travelers from countries other than China where community transmission has emerged.\nAt a rally in South Carolina on Friday night, Trump defended his administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak and accused Democrats of politicizing the disease.\n“This is their new hoax,” Trump said at the event, held a day before the state’s Democratic presidential primary.\nThe U.S. State Department has issued travel advisories for several nations and on Friday it said Americans should reconsider travel to Italy, where nearly 900 coronavirus cases have been confirmed. A similar warning was issued earlier this week for South Korea, which has hundreds of infections.\nA government task force appointed by Trump to deal with the threat will meet at the White House on Saturday morning, according to an administration official.\nLatest figures from China, where the outbreak started late last year, indicated that nearly 80,000 people have been infected, with more than 2,800 deaths. The World Health Organization reported 57 deaths in 46 other countries.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a closed-door briefing in the U.S. House of Representatives that sustained spread of the coronavirus meant there would be many more infections in the United States, according to a source.\nFauci warned lawmakers the country lacked enough testing resources, the source said on condition of anonymity. The CDC said it has revised its criteria for who should be tested and is ramping up testing capabilities.\n“Our goal is to have every state and local health department online and doing their own testing by the end of next week,” CDC official Nancy Messonier told reporters.\nA vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop, health officials have said.\nThe United States has decided to postpone a meeting with leaders of Southeast Asian countries it had planned to host on March 14 in Las Vegas because of worries about the outbreak.\nU.S. and global stocks plummeted as rattled investors braced for the prospect that a pandemic could further dent an already slowing world economy.\nThe S&P 500 .SPX fell for the seventh straight day on Friday, suffering its biggest weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis. Stocks cut losses right at the end of the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 1.4%.\nTrump this week said the coronavirus risk to Americans remained “very low,” but he has been increasingly alarmed by the reaction of the U.S. stock market, which he considers a barometer of the economy’s health.\n(GRAPHIC - Tracking the novel coronavirus: here)\n",

Lombardy, around Italy’s financial capital Milan, is by far with hardest hit, with 38 casualties.\nThe virus has since spread south but the vast majority of cases remain centered on the original hotspots, with the addition of Emilia Romagna, another affluent region which borders on both Lombardy and Veneto and now has more cases than Veneto.\nIn total, 2,036 people have tested positive in Italy, up from 1,694 on Sunday. Of these, 149 have recovered, the civil protection agency said.\n“What is comforting is that 50% of the 258 people who tested positive (in the last 24 hours) have no symptoms or are being looked after at home,” Angelo Borrelli, head of the agency, told reporters.\nIn total, Italy has tested 23,345 people for the disease.\nThe Lombardy regional government urged people over the age of 65 to remain at home, as data showed they were by far the most vulnerable to the highly contagious illness.\n“All those who have died (in Lombardy) are people over 65 with underlying health conditions, especially cardiovascular problems,” said Giulio Gallera, the region’s councillor responsible for welfare policy.\nIn a worrying development, a policeman and a fireman based in Rome have also tested positive, authorities said, raising the risk of the virus spreading in the Italian capital.\nCases in Rome, Italy’s largest city with 3 million people, had previously been limited to a Chinese couple on holiday and an Italian repatriated from the Chinese city of Wuhan - where the outbreak originated late last year - on a special flight and hospitalized. All three recovered.\nOn Monday the Spallanzani infectious diseases hospital where the policeman was staying announced that his wife, two children and sister-in-law were also infected.\nThe school attended by his son, in the nearby town of Pomezia, was closed and lessons were suspended in the university faculty at Rome’s main Sapienza university, attended by his other son.\nThe coronavirus is taking a heavy toll on Italy’s economy, which was already teetering on the verge of recession before the outbreak, with sectors from manufacturing to tourism hit by a plunge in orders.\nSeveral international airlines including Lufthansa Delta Airlines and countries such as the Czech Republic have reduced or suspended flights to Italian cities.\nMilan cathedral reopened to the public on Monday but schools and universities remain closed and many companies told staff to work from home.\nThe top of the UniCredit  skyscraper in Milan was lit in red, white and green, the colors of the Italian flag, in a sign of solidarity with people hit by the virus.\nNational statistics bureau ISTAT reported on Monday that the 2019 budget deficit came in at 1.6% of national output, the smallest fiscal gap for 12 years.\nThe much-lower-than-expected reading potentially gives the coalition of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party more leeway to spend and borrow this year - good news with coronavirus costs soaring.\nEconomy Minister Roberto Gualtieri announced on Sunday the cabinet would this week approve 3.6 billion euros ($3.5 billion) of measures to help companies.\nAn aid package worth 900 million euros was unveiled on Friday for the worst-impacted zones.\n",

However, the vitamin is considered by some researchers as a means to support the treatment of severe inflammatory processes.\nFacts: A spokesperson of the Federal Institute for Medicinal Products could not confirm the alleged virulent effect of vitamin C at the request of the German Press Agency.

In addition, new restrictions would be imposed on Iran. Foreigners who have been in Iran in the last 14-day period are no longer allowed to enter the United States. Pence, on behalf of President Donald Trump, heads the working group on the fight against the Coronavirus in the White House. Americans should exercise particular caution in Europe at the moment, Trump said shortly afterwards in a speech.\nShortly before, the first death victim in the United States had been reported by the new Coronavirus. The victim's exact identity was first confused: Trump said at a White House press conference that it was a woman in the late 1950s in Washington, United States. Shortly thereafter, Jeff Duchin, chief health officer of Seattle and King County, said at a telephone press conference of the U.S. Health Authority CDC that it was a man in his late 50s. CDC director Robert Redfield later tweeted that the CDC had previously mistakenly identified the victim as a woman in an information for Trump and Pence.\nHow the man infected himself was still completely unclear, said Health Commissioner Duchin. \"We don't see any connections at this time.\" But he's had health problems before.\nAdditionally, the number of known cases of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the US increased to 22, said Nancy Messonier, head of the Department of Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases of the CDC. \"The preliminary information reinforces our concern about the imminent threat to certain groups in the UHealth Minister Alex Azar had previously said, \"The risk remains low. But that can change quickly.\"Azar added,\"We will see more cases.\"\nTwo provisionally confirmed cases in a nursing home in the state of Washington caused particular concern, as the responsible health officer Duchin said. It was a member of the nursing staff and a woman about 70-year-old. In addition, many other nurses and patients complained of symptoms. \"I wouldn't be surprised if we found more cases,\" Duchin said. \"It is an outstanding task to manage an outbreak in an institution where so many vulnerable people are.\"\nOnly on Friday, because of the spread of the Coronavirus, the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs raised the travel information for the whole of Italy to level three: therefore, unnecessary travel should be considered. Trump's government had previously imposed travel restrictions on China, which continue to apply. Also from there no foreigners who had visited the country in the last 14 days may enter.\nIn the USA, according to the health authority CDC, infections with Sars-CoV-2 had been detected in 15 people by Friday. Other 47 cases occurred with US citizens who were brought back to the United States from Japan or China. Trump announced to meet with representatives of pharmaceutical companies in the White House on Monday.\nTrump has so far tried to play down the issue. The President repeatedly stressed that the US was prepared for the virus. On Tuesday, Messonnier of the CDC said it was less a question of whether the virus would spread in the US, but rather of when it would happen. Trump, on the other hand, had stressed on Wednesday that he did not think that expansion in the US was inevitable.\nTrump also tries to avoid further losses on the already hard-pressed stock markets through his commentsYeah.

        "news_content_translate_en": "On this Friday, the German Red Cross (DRC) is expecting more travellers from the Chinese town of Wuhan, which is particularly affected by the Coronavirus, in Stuttgart.\nThe DRC takes over the care on behalf of the federal government, said a spokesman for the relief organisation on Thursday in Berlin. A spokesman for the Baden-Wuttemberg Ministry of Social Affairs said the health authorities were prepared for the arrival of the people. Initially, the Southwest Round had reported on this.\nAccording to information from the German Press Agency, more than a dozen people are to fly to Stuttgart. They first arrive in Paris with other Europeans in a French plane and are expected in the morning at Stuttgart airport. After their arrival, the travellers are to be examined and then probably taken to a quarantine station in the district of Esslingen.\nThe DRC had already operated a quarantine station in Germersheim (Rhineland-Palatinate) to which the first German returnees from Wuhan on the 1st. February had come. At the moment, it still handles passengers on a later return flight to Berlin.\nOutside mainland China, more than ten Covid-19 deaths have now been recorded, with dozens of people in critical condition. Covid-19 is the disease caused by the new Coronavirus Sars-CoV-2.\nIn South Korea, the number of infections recorded doubled by 53 to 104 within one day. A man died in a hospital in the southeastern city of Cheongdo, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many of the new cases were reported from Daegu and the province of North Gyeongsang. Authorities suspect that many of those affected were infected with Sars-CoV-2 when they visited the divine service of a Christian sect in Daegu. Around 2,5 million people live in DaegYeah. Concerned about the uncontrolled spread of the virus, they should stay home for the time being.\nThe extent of possible infections in Iran was still unclear. Two Covid-19 deaths had been reported in the city of Ghom on Wednesday; no infection had previously been reported in the country. It's supposed to be two older men. According to authorities, the persons concerned had not been outside their home town of Ghom. They also had no contact with Chinese tourists. According to the Ministry of Health, there are also three other proven infections in the country. All schools and universities in Ghom were provisionally closed, as reported by IRNA. The almost 1,2 million inhabitants of Ghom should avoid physical contact.\nMeanwhile, China has again changed the number of confirmed infections. As the Health Commission said, clinical diagnoses should no longer be included as confirmed cases in the statistics. The severely affected province of Hubei, where the virus had broken out, had only last week begun to count such diagnoses. Physicians determine the disease based on lung images and the physical condition. Now, once again, only DNA tests in the lab are to be considered.\nThe official statistics recorded until Thursday around 75.000 infections and more than 2100 deaths in the country. Experts, however, have long been expecting a much higher dark figure. Even a Chinese scientist is now questioning whether the epidemic can still be stopped and the virus disappears again. Covid-19 could become an established disease like the flu, said Wang Chen, president of the China Academy of Medical Science, on state televisioYeah.\nAccording to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, two clinical trials are under way in China to treat patients. Provisional results should be expected in three weeks. Among other things, the trial included medicines against the AIDS agent HIV.\nIn Japan, two passengers of the cruise ship Diamond Princess were killed by the new Coronavirus. It was already known that more than twenty of the patients infected with Sars-CoV-2 were seriously ill. Now an 84-year-old Japanese woman and an 87-year-old Japanese woman died, as the Japanese television station NHK reported. The cruise ship had been under quarantine for two weeks with a passenger after being identified. Among the original 3700 passengers and crew members, 634 infections were detected until Thursday. All those affected came to hospitals.\nPassengers who tested negative for the virus, like the previous day, had more than 500 people on board. An Italian returnee with around twenty Italians and as many other Europeans should land in Germany, among other things. Passengers who could return to their home country include four with German nationality and two of their spouses. A couple want to stay in Japan first, two more Germans are proven to be infected and are treated in a Japanese clinic.\nSome visitors were expected from the \"Diamond Princess\" in Berlin: \"There will probably be a landing in Tegel this Saturday, again in the military part, because two Berliners are among the passengers,\" said Health Senator Dilek Kalayci. The plan was to isolate them at home for a fortnight. Those who do not live in Berlin are then first brought by DRK staff to their hometowYeah.\nOn the way home, passengers of the cruise ship Westerdam, with which 57 Germans had also landed a few days ago, remained in Cambodia. According to the Ministry of Health of North Rhine-Westphalia, ten people from the Federal Republic were on board. Six of them are already home. According to the Recklinghausen district, the remaining four passengers will land this Friday by plane in Dusseldorf. The two couples from Dorsten and Recklinghausen are to be quarantined at home. Except for one American, the Sars-CoV-2 virus has so far not been detected in any of the people on Westerdam. (dpa",

The Tokyo Games are due in 150 days.\nOn Tuesday, it was also announced that the World Cup Table tennis federation will postpone the planned team championship in the South Korean Busan by at least three months. The 6th. to 8. The World Cup planned in Padua will be moved to Tauberbischofsheim in March. The German-Eighth will complete his planned training camp not in Garivate in Lombardy, but in March in Lago Azul in Portugal.\nWith a view to the EM this summer, the European Football Union is watching UEFA closely with current developments. \"We are in a phase of waiting and watching the situation country by country: football must follow the instructions of the governments in the individual states,\" said UEFA Vice-President Michele Uva to the Italian radio station Rai.\nThe EM opening game is due on 12th.

Consequences for the tournament can only be expected \"in case of emergency\", Uva said. \"The sports route will only be closed when the situation worsens,\" said the ItaliaYeah.

        "news_content_translate_en": "On Friday morning, a Berlin resident can no longer help himself and posts on Facebook: \"Soon we will run out of disinfectants, masks and protective coats. In case you have stocks that you do not need, please contact us.\"At an intensive care station in Aachen, virus-resistant protective masks are stored only in a safe and individually issued to colleagues. Other clinics, on the recommendation of the Robert Koch Institute, move to create in front of the patient's rooms places where each caregiver can remove a personal mask that he only uses on a particular patient, so that the carers and nurses can use the masks in the shift several times. The fight against the Coronavirus is also a material battle. And the material is scarce everywhere at the moment.\nViral protective masks and suits are as important for employees in hospitals and medical practices as helmets and respiratory protective equipment for firefighters in a fire. Without the appropriate equipment, \"you can certainly not expect employees to continue working here,\" Uwe Janssens says. He is president of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (Divi). Janssens, too, is concerned that supplies in many clinics will not last long: \"Evidently, we currently have too few resources in Germany in this area, particularly with regard to the special FFP2 masks that should be used in direct contact with patients suffering from Covid-19.\"\nJohannes Pott is an intensive care physician at St. Bernward Hospital in Hildesheim. If he's notified from the emergency room of a patient who's even suspected of being infected with Covid-19, Pott slips into a body armor that looks like the suits from the crime scene\" Even patients who later find themselves suffering from a simple bronchitis or pneumonia caused by other diseases must be treated as if they had Corona,\"says Pott. For an intensive care facility like his, that means a huge daily need. Even if there are only four Corona patients, up to 20-year-olds in the triangular system are employed in their care. And each of them is only allowed to wear a protective suit and a mask once. As soon as he goes to another patient, he has to dispose of them and put on new clothes.\" There you quickly get into the situation of consuming over a day hundreds of such sets,\"says Pott.\nThorsten Luersen is a hospital hygienist at Potts Clinic. He is not afraid of an emergency, the hospital still has several thousand masks with the appropriate viral protection in stock.\" We will deal with this for four weeks.\"Nevertheless, Luersen appeals to politics:\"We still urgently need your help in procuring protective clothing, respiratory equipment and disinfectants. Otherwise, we will not be able to guarantee safe patient care in the long term.\"\nThe Federal Government has heard the cries for help. On Wednesday, Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn announced that ten million protective masks had arrived and could be distributed. His ministry informs on request that the first shipments of medical protective equipment came from Federal Army depots on Friday to the cashier's associations and the federal states. More deliveries are expected over the weekend, so that protective masks can also be distributed as soon as possible via the medical association and the federal states to the practices, nursing homes and hospitals,\"says a spokeswomaYeah.\nThe Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Finance had taken over the procurement of the medical material. Both ministries have large procurement offices. The Federal Armed Forces and the General Customs Directorate have concluded various contracts with suppliers, from disinfectants and disposable gloves to masks and protective suits. The total order volume so far is 241 million euro. According to these supply contracts, the batch of ten million masks mentioned by Health Minister Spahn was also included.\nThe offers were obtained mainly from German companies, but also in Europe and worldwide, says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence. \"The German Defence We must, of course, examine and sort them out, eventually certain requirements must be met and we get an awful lot of unsatisfactory offers.\"Some things are harder to get than others, but overall the procurement is going very well. The Bundeswehr also provides the logistics for storing the material first, so the goods are delivered to warehouses of the Bundeswehr. The Ministry of Health then coordinates the distribution.\nIn addition to procurement, the policy aims to promote the production of protective materials. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday in German radio that she had asked all the companies producing protective clothing to increase their production significantly. And \"we've asked other companies to convert their production roads and now only produce this medical material.\"\nBut there is still a gap between political will and practical implementation. For example, the material is to be distributed according to \"urgency and actual need\", as a spokesman for the German hospital company says. But no one has been able to say what this means in concrete termsYeah. Apparently, at the moment, no one has an overview of which clinic and which practice require just how much material.\nManufacturers of such goods also lack information. Ming Gutsche has been producing protective medical clothing with her company Dach in Rastatt in Baden-Wuerttemberg since 1996. Like almost all manufacturers of such products, roof also produces most in China. Your customers are hospitals, but also pharmaceutical companies and the food industry. Since the beginning of the Corona pandemic, it has only supplied hospitals and rescue services. Still, Gutsche says she's sold out. Several containers from China still await them, but they are also already planted.\nIn order not to get into such a situation again, she now wants to build up her own production as quickly as possible in Rastatt. To this end, it has developed three machines in cooperation with a Swabian mechanical engineer and has made agreements with German manufacturers of fibrous materials. In the three-layer system she could produce up to half a million respiratory masks every day, Gutsche estimates. Production should start in eight weeks at the latest. Provided there are accelerated administrative procedures by the Federation and no Covid-19-related failures by suppliers.\nThe Federal Medical Technology Association (BVMed) already warns that there may be bottlenecks in the supply of pre-products for protective equipment, especially for materials produced in South East Asia. BVMed spokesman Manfred Beeres said: \"Especially not in hospitals. Now some manufacturers would be under pressure because some clinics did not pay their bills or were only delayed.\" They now have their own liquidity problems.\"The same can be heard from hospital companiesYeah.\nMoreover, at the moment, no one can calculate how much protective equipment is actually needed in general. Bernd Muhlbauer, a health economist at Gelsenkirchen University in the West, says that all the figures that were quoted were only very rough approximations, both the monthly 89 million respiratory masks distributed by the World Health Organisation worldwide and the ten million masks of the Health Minister.\" This is political will, not calculation of exactly how much is needed.\"\nCooperation: Eva Hoffmann and Yassin Musharbas",

Due to the popularity of covid-19, Moscow has taken restrictive measures: from Monday, students will study remotely and many adults will be transferred to remote jobs. How do we find a new coronavirus, how to treat it, why we need a simple quarantine, Russian News Agency reporter listened to the introduction of the consultant of the scientific work of the central Epidemiology Research Institute of the Russian Federal Health Supervision Bureau and the chief expert of the No. 2 infectious clinical hospital. Academician Victor maleev.\n-According to the latest information, 199 people in Russia have been infected with the new Colorado virus. Why quarantine if the official number of patients is small?\n-There are no more patients. We are not fully quarantined. This is a restrictive measure. If the number of new cases increases, measures must be strengthened. It is not allowed to go out of the house and produce. Everything will freeze. Therefore, efforts are being made to ensure that this does not happen.\nUnfortunately, the incidence is rising. Just a few days ago, we added three or four new patients, yesterday it was 30. Now, we're talking about it, but it could double in the morning. So we have to advance. There could be a fatal result soonAbout\n-The operating room just announced that the 79 year old woman died\nI saw her yesterday. She was complicated by a chronic illness. By the way, this patient is a good example of why isolation and isolation are needed. I mean, she didn't say she was abroad. Apparently, she has connections at home with people from Goa, India. Someone came to visit her - one was not quarantined in time. Unfortunately, this is already a local shift. The second mistake: she left too late. She should be sent to our infection hospital right away. She went to a clinic, and then in the second, and then she came to us.\nWe diagnosed covid-19 and started treatment, but the patient already had complications of chronic diseases. -- reported at the headquarters of disease control this afternoon, The patient died of a large number of bilateral thrombi and pulmonary arteries. - about. Red\n-How to treat covid-19 in Moscow hospital?\nWe use special antiviral drugs. There are instructions on how to treat specific coronaviruses. However, these data are provisional because they are regularly revised based on new infection data. We don't have much experience, including China's. Now I have the seventh version of the Chinese method that they usAbout\nWe also used some drugs that proved effective in the treatment of SARS, because these viruses are 90%. We must give the patients comprehensive intensive drugs. Therefore, if people with many related chronic diseases, such as heart disease, become ill, the heart will be strengthened so that the body can control the infection.\nYou mentioned SARS caused by SARS virus. Its full name is SARS CoV, and the new Colorado State is SARS cov-2. Can we say that this is the same thing in two versions?\n- No. This is a brand new virus. This is 90% of SARS CoV homology, which leads to SARS, but it is quite different. At least no new virus was found in the diagnosis of SARS. Some sars-cov-2 looks like mers, like SARS.\nCould a new coronavirus be artificial?\n- No. In order to produce a new virus, its prototype should not be just a variation)（ In other words, the difference between the RNA of a new virus and its predecessor must be considerable, and there must be many differences. It's impossible. Only nature can do this. We haven't fully studied its full capabilities: why it produces new viruses, where it hides themAbout As we all know, infections are cyclical: they happen, then disappear, and then reappear in a while. It's a time to return, and it's hard to predict if it's not a seasonal infection.\nFor example, SARS was discovered in 2002 at about the same time as the new Colorado virus: November. By the summer of 2003, he was gone. Since then, they have been looking for, they want to find a sick person, but not infected. Why? No one can understand. There are samples of SARS CoV virus isolated from patients and stored in a special laboratory without infection.\n-Will the new coronavirus disappear like SARS?\n-Who knows? This is unpredictable. It's like we can't predict if it's going to be seasonal. You know we're still in the same season for the time being. We should see what will happen next year, and then we can come to a conclusion. We didn't even know he would be in a while.\n-Information can be found on the Internet（ The average temperature there is about the same every year. Is that so?\n-No, because the countries that have found new diseases are in different parallel positions. For example, the situation in Chile and Italy is deteriorating, but they are not exactly the sameAbout\n-May we have a similar situation in Colorado virus in Italy?\nShe won't happen again. We must do everything possible to avoid that in the future. That's why preventive restrictions are being implemented in Moscow. Unfortunately, people are not always able to assess the level of the threat. So, at some point, the government has to take tough action. Then, of course, it can be criticized, although, in my opinion, it is praiseworthy. In any case, Russia - one of the few countries that has succeeded in borders with China over the years - is not letting new infections in.\nYou know, people often ask me: why do we have so few infected people? If China is nearby. My answer: the density of residents in China's border areas is lower than that in Russia and Europe. The main patient is still in Moscow. In the Far East and Siberia, there are no such big cities. There is no such thing as Vladivostok and Khabarovsk. All the patients found in various regions - such as Nizhny Novgorod, Akim - returned from abroad and passed through Moscow.\n-How fast is the coroner?\nFour to eight hoursAbout\nSo now patients' biological samples are not sent to virus and Biotechnology Center vector \"Novosibirsk\"?\n-Now we have Colorado virus test systems everywhere. The analysis was carried out in Moscow before, but because it was the first time, they were considered suspicious, so the samples were sent to Novosibirsk for inspection. Now we only send suspicious results.\nDoes the covid-19 test require a hard filter? Now there have been complaints that doctors have refused to carry out such tests.\nThis makes sense because covid-19 is a medical procedure. Let's say there's no evidence for the X-rays and MRI that everyone wants to do - we don't have enough doctors or equipment. Most people don't need these studies. This is a similar situation. They were afraid and asked to do tests.\nThere's only one coroner that paramedics have to do. It's a procedure that includes bleeding, mucous membranes of the nose and throat. This needs some protection. If you doubt it, you can always call the hotline and tell them. Someone comes to you, maybe they'll analyze the biomaterials, maybe they won'tAbout\nFirst of all, this analysis enables those who come back from abroad to contact them, even if they have no symptoms of coronavirus infection.\nIn addition, the new coronavirus has a sinister ability: it may appear in the body, it will disappear. What do I mean? For example, if the patient is seriously dry, he swallows a lot of things and breathes something, then the virus may not show up in the test. In the test, it already exists. Therefore, the analysis must be modified several times.\n-Excuse me, as an infected person, should the person who contacts with the infected person be fined for violating the quarantine?\nYes, of course. What are they doing? Infect others. Now, everyone is afraid of bacterial weapons, but these contacts, in fact, are real bacterial bombs. Because they work with the virus and spread it. Intentional HIV infection is a punishment. This is the same. People bring unhappiness to society, so they have to take responsibility for it. If we do not punish them, they will continue to act and we will not be able to stop the epidemic.\nYou see, it's very difficult to predict the spread of new infections now, because more cases of coronavirus will be brought to Russia 100%. We have 1800 tourists in MontenegroAbout There are Russians in Spain, Italy, some countries in Germany, where the epidemic situation is complex. This is the great potential of infection in our country. At present, we only have 10 cases of local Colorado virus transfer, people contact with foreign people. We all got them. Next, it all depends on people's consciousness, they will come back. If they stay isolated, see a doctor in time, call a hotline, and if other people don't like the Colorado River, we can deal with the epidemic. Now a lot of things depend on you and me",

And my blood group holders are less likely to be infected than others. Experts published their research reports in medrxiv Electronic Science Library.\n\"For the first time, we found a link between blood groups and the risk of coronavirus infection. In particular, the second blood group (a) increases the risk of infection, while the first blood group (o) is less likely to be infected by the virus. If our data are confirmed, these characteristics of virus should be considered in medical practice. \"\nExperts in medicine and Biology (Wuhan University, China) and their colleagues at Shenzhen South University of science and technology are interested in whether there are other risk factors, In addition to age, lung injury, chronic disease and compromised immunity.\nThey drew attention to the fact that many viruses, including hepatitis B, Norfolk virus and some other pathogens, attack fourth blood group vectors much more frequently than others. And the pathogen of SARS, SARS, rarely enters the body of the first blood group carrier)About\nBased on this idea, the researchers determined the proportion of different blood types among ordinary residents in Wuhan. It turns out that there are nearly 4000 people in the monitoring group One third of the population belongs to category I, another third to category II, a quarter to category III and the remaining 9.1 per cent to category IV.\nBlood and virus\nIn the second part of the study, the scientists studied the same proportion of people suffering from covid-19 in a large hospital in Wuhan, 200 of whom have died. It has been proved that the proportion of the second type of patients is higher than that of the healthy population, 37.8% and 32.2% respectively. However, in the first group of owners, the opposite is true, their proportion is lower, 25.8% of patients and 33.8% of healthy people.\nTherefore, the proportion of patients with the first blood group is much lower, and the proportion of patients with the second blood group is much higher.\nIn order to check these proportions, scholars also investigated 398 patients' information in two other hospitals (Wuhan and Shenzhen). The hypothesis confirms that people with blood group 2 are more likely to be infected with coronavirus than other blood groups.\nWhat makes the second blood group carrier vulnerable to virus attack? Doctors can't say for the time beinAbout The researchers hope that a follow-up analysis of the data collected during the AIDS peak in Wuhan and other cities in China will help them find out.\nRussian federation\nThere are now more than 182000 people registered around the world. It is estimated that the number of new cases of coronavirus infection in 2001 was about 71000. The incidence and incidence of these diseases are increasing. Human beings. Outside China, the disease has been found in 155 countries, including Russia.\nAt the end of December, a new coronavirus (covid-19) broke out in Wuhan, China. In early March, the World Health Organization recognized the spread of the disease around the world, calling covid-19 a pandemic.\nThe new type of coronavirus belongs to the same kind of virus as SARS and mers, i.e. SARS and the Middle East mycoplasma. In the past decade, these two viruses have claimed hundreds of lives in the Middle East and East Asia and have repeatedly caused epidemics, Spread through camels and poultry. According to scientists, the original viral vector was bats, and there is also evidence that this may be the responsibility of pangolian or snakes.\n",

More information can be found here  .\nThe claim that coronavirus is designed is unfounded. CDC explains the source of COVID-19 was most likely a large seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, China (see here ). COVID-19 is believed to have spread from an animal to a person much like MERS and SARS. There is no indication or publicly available evidence suggesting that the coronavirus was \"designed\".\nThe Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation did fund a research center in England called the Pirbright Institute, (see here ; more on the institute www.pirbright.ac.uk/ ), which is named in the misleading post. The Pirbright Institute specializes in the study of viruses that affect farm animals, and viruses which transfer from animals to people, but they do not own a patent on the COVID-19 coronavirus. The Pirbright Institute has a patent for a type of coronavirus affecting animals (primarily chickens), which can be seen here  . The Pirbright Institute addressed the confusion between their patent and the novel coronavirus, COVID-19:\n\"The Pirbright Institute carries out research on infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, here), a coronavirus that infects poultry, and porcine deltacoronavirus that infects pigs. Pirbright does not currently work with human coronaviruses. More information on our coronavirus livestock research can be found on our website.\"\nThe post claims the “CDC will soon say a vaccine is available for Ebola, Zika and/or Corona.” There is already a vaccine for a certain strain of Ebola, see here No vaccines are currently publicly available for Zika, see here  . There is still no vaccine available for COVID-19.\nThe image further claims: \"The vaccine will contain the virus. If you get vaccinated, you might become infected with the virus.\" Some vaccines do contain a version of the virus that has been weakened, but it will not give you the disease it's vaccinating against. The CDC clearly describes how vaccination works here  . The CDC explains: “Vaccines help develop immunity by imitating an infection. This type of infection, however, almost never causes illness, but it does cause the immune system to produce T-lymphocytes and antibodies. Sometimes, after getting a vaccine, the imitation infection can cause minor symptoms, such as fever. Such minor symptoms are normal and should be expected as the body builds immunity.” There are multiple types of vaccines. Some – not all – vaccines use parts of a virus to strengthen the immune system to it, and this is done in a medical, scientific process (see here). Safe vaccines pass many stages before becoming available to the public, see more on this here .\nFalse: The coronavirus is not designed, Bill Gates did not patent COVID-19 and there is still no vaccine.

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several months before the coronavirus pandemic began, the Trump administration eliminated a key American public health position in Beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in China, Reuters has learned.\nThe American disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China’s disease control agency, left her post in July, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November, and as cases exploded, the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to help.\n“It was heartbreaking to watch,” said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. “If someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.”\nZhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr. Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.\nAs an American CDC employee, they said, Quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the United States and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier.\nNo other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Quick left in July, according to the sources. Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts.\nZhu and the other sources said Quick could have provided real-time information to U.S. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the Chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments.\nQuick left amid a bitter U.S. trade dispute with China when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the U.S. Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, would be discontinued as of September, the sources said. The U.S. CDC said it first learned of a “cluster of 27 cases of pneumonia” of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31.\nSince then, the outbreak of the disease known as COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. The epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems in some countries, including Italy, and threatens to do so in the United States and elsewhere.\nDuring a press briefing on Sunday shortly after this story was first published, President Donald Trump dismissed the Reuters report as similar to other stories regarding the CDC that he described as “100 percent wrong,” without addressing whether the role had been eliminated.\nU.S. CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield maintained the agency’s presence in China “is actually being augmented as we speak,” without elaborating.\nIn a statement to Reuters before the report was published, the CDC said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder Washington’s ability to get information and “had absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier.”\nThe agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser “started well before last summer and was due to China’s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.”\nThe CDC said it has assigned two of its Chinese employees as “mentors” to help with the training program. The agency did not respond to questions about the mentors’ specific role or expertise.\nThe CDC would not make Quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment.\nAsked for comment on Chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred Reuters to remarks by spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday. Geng said the country “has adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (World Health Organization) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.”\nOne disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government’s suppression of information.\n“In the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn’t have made a big difference,” Scott McNabb, who was a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at Emory University. “The problem was how the Chinese handled it. What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn’t.”\nAlex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) said on Friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early January, based on Redfield’s conversations with “Chinese colleagues.”\nRedfield learned that “this looks to be a novel coronavirus” from Dr. Gao Fu, the head of the China CDC, according to an HHS administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Dr. Redfield always talked to Dr. Gao,” the official said.\nHHS and CDC did not make Azar or Redfield available for comment.\nZhu and other sources said U.S. leaders should not have been relying on the China CDC director for alerts and updates. In general, they said, officials in China downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until Jan. 20.\nAfter the epidemic exploded and China had imposed strict quarantines, Trump administration officials complained that the Chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the United States had been unable to get American disease experts into the country to help contain the spread.\nAzar told CNN on Feb. 14 that he and CDC director Redfield officially offered to send a CDC team into China on Jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. HHS oversees the CDC.\n“Dr. Redfield and I made the offer on January 6th - 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,” Azar said. “We made the offer to send the CDC experts in to assist their Chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? What is the severity? What is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?”\nDays later, the World Health Organization secured permission to send a team that included two U.S. experts. The team visited between Feb. 16th and 24th. By then, China had reported more than 75,000 cases.\nOn Feb. 25, the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak at home, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its “censorship” of medical professionals and media.\nRelations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as Trump has labeled the coronavirus the “Chinese virus” - a description the Chinese have condemned as stigmatizing. Last week, the Chinese government announced that Americans from three U.S. news organizations, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, would be expelled from China.\nThe decision to eliminate Quick’s job came as the CDC has scaled back the number of U.S. staffers in China over the last two years, the sources told Reuters.\n“We had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,” the same expert said.\nThe CDC, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move. “It was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability” it said.\nThe U.S. CDC team in Beijing now includes three American citizens in permanent roles, an additional American who is temporary and around 10 Chinese nationals, the agency said. Of the Americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. COVID-19 is not influenza, though it can cause severe respiratory illness.\nThe CDC team, aside from Quick, was housed at U.S. Embassy facilities. No American CDC staffer besides Quick was embedded with China’s disease control agency, the sources said.\nChina in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people.\nNevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with Reuters said, the United States could use people like Quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes.\nThomas R. Frieden, a former director of the CDC, said that if the U.S. resident adviser had still been in China, “it is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.”\nDr. George Conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows Quick and had served as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among U.S health officials over whether China should be paying for funding its own training program.\nYet since the training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of Chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries.\n“We go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,” Conway said.\nIn 2007, Dr. Robert Fontaine, a CDC epidemiologist  and one of the longest serving U.S. officials in the adviser’s position, received China’s highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause.\nBut since last year, Frieden and others said, growing tensions between the Trump administration and China’s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration.\n“The message from the administration was, ‘Don’t work with China, they’re our rival,’” Frieden said.\nTrump’s re-election campaign sent out a statement Sunday evening dismissing controversy about the CDC’S cut as a matter of politics.\n“Democrats are eager to politicize the coronavirus crisis and weaponize it against President Trump, the statement said. “In so doing, they’re siding with the Chinese and providing cover for Beijing’s cover-up.”\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "华盛顿（路透社）-路透社获悉，在冠状病毒大流行开始前几个月，特朗普政府取消了美国在北京的一个重要公共卫生职位，该职位旨在帮助发现中国爆发的疾病。\n据四位知情人士透露，这位美国疾病专家是中国疾病控制机构的一名医学流行病学家，今年7月离职。新冠状病毒的首批病例可能早在11月就已经出现，随着病例的爆发，特朗普政府在2月就斥责中国审查有关疫情的信息，阻止美国专家进入中国提供帮助。\n2007年至2011年间，美国疾病预防控制中心（U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention）资助了担任这一职务的华裔朱宝平（Bao Ping Zhu），他说：“看到这一幕令人心碎。“如果有人在场，全世界的公共卫生官员和政府可能会行动得更快。”\n朱和其他消息来源说，美国专家琳达·奎克博士是中国现场流行病学家的培训师，他们被派往疫情中心，帮助追踪、调查和控制疾病。\n他们说，作为美国疾控中心的一名员工，Quick处于一个理想的位置，可以成为美国和其他国家在冠状病毒爆发时的耳目，并可能在几周前提醒他们注意日益增长的威胁。\n据消息人士透露，在Quick于7月离开后，没有其他外国疾病专家参与领导该项目。朱镕基说，在与中国同行建立密切关系之后，一位嵌入式专家往往可以很早得到疫情爆发的消息。\n朱和其他消息来源说，Quick可以向美国提供实时信. 以及世界各地的其他官员在疫情爆发的头几周表示，中国政府严厉打击信息发布，并提供了错误的评估。\n消息人士说，在美国与中国激烈的贸易争端中，她得知自己在中国的联邦资助职位（官方称为美国现场流行病学培训项目驻中国顾问）将于9月停止工作，于是迅速离开。美国疾控中心说，他们于12月31日在中国武汉首次发现了一个来源不明的“27例肺炎病例群”。\n此后，这种被称为COVID-19的疾病在全球迅速蔓延，造成13600多人死亡，317000多人感染。这一流行病已使包括意大利在内的一些国家的医疗系统不堪重负，并威胁到美国和其他地方的医疗系统。\n在这篇报道首次发表后不久的周日新闻发布会上，美国总统特朗普（Donald Trump）驳斥路透社的报道与他所说的“100%错误”的有关疾病预防控制中心的其他报道相似，但没有说明这一角色是否已被取消。\nU、 美国疾控中心主任罗伯特雷德菲尔德博士坚持说，该机构在中国的存在“实际上是在扩大，正如我们所说，”没有详细说明。\n中国疾控中心在报告发表前向路透社发表声明说，取消顾问职位并不妨碍华盛顿获取信息的能力，“与疾控中心没有更早了解中国的病例完全无关”\n该机构表示，其决定不设常驻顾问“早在去年夏天就开始了，这是因为中国的技术能力和项目的成熟。”\n中国疾控中心表示，已指派两名中国员工作为“导师”协助培训计划。该机构没有回答有关导师具体角色或专业知识的问题。\n疾控中心不愿让仍在该机构工作的Quick发表评.\n在被问及中国对疫情的透明度和反应能力时，中国外交部援引路透社发言人耿爽周五的讲话。耿雁生说，中国“以公开、透明、负责任的方式，采取了最严格、最全面、最彻底的防控措施，及时向（世界卫生组织）和有关国家和地区通报了最新情况。”\n一位疾病专家对路透社表示，鉴于中国政府对信息的压制，他怀疑这位美国常驻顾问是否能够更早或更好地向特朗普政府获取信息。\n“最终，根据中国的情况，这可能不会有太大的改变，”斯科特·麦克纳布说，他是疾控中心的流行病学家，20年了，现在是埃默里大学的研究教授。“问题是中国人是如何处理的。应该改变的是，中国人应该早一点承认，而不是。”\n美国卫生与公众服务部（HHS）部长阿历克斯•阿扎尔（Alex Azar）上周五表示，根据雷德菲尔德与“中国同事”的谈话，他的机构在1月初得知了冠状病毒\n据一位不愿透露姓名的卫生部官员透露，雷德菲尔德从中国疾控中心主任高福博士那里得知，“这看起来是一种新型冠状病毒”。“雷德菲尔德医生总是和高医生说话，”这位官员说。\n卫生部和疾病预防控制中心没有让Azar或Redfield发表评论。\n朱镕基和其他消息人士说，美国领导人不应该依赖中国疾控中心主任发出警报和更新。他们说，总的来说，中国官员在最初几周低估了疫情的严重性，直到1月20日才承认有人与人之间传播的证.\n疫情爆发后，中国实施了严格的隔离措施，特朗普政府官员抱怨说，中国审查了有关疫情的信息，美国无法让美国疾病专家入境帮助遏制疫情蔓延。\n阿扎尔2月14日告诉CNN，他和疾控中心主任雷德菲尔德1月6日正式提出派遣一支疾控中心小组进入中国，但仍然没有得到允许他们进入中国。卫生部监督疾病预防控制中心。\n阿扎尔说：“雷德菲尔德医生和我在1月6日至36天前提出了这个提议，6万例病例和1300例死亡。“我们提出让疾控中心的专家来帮助他们的中国同事弄清关键的科学问题，比如，这种疾病是如何传播的？严重程度如何？潜伏期是多少，会不会有无症状的传播？”\n几天后，世界卫生组织获得了派遣一个由两名美国专家组成的小组的许可。该队在2月16日至24日期间访问过。到那时，中国已经报告了75000多起病例。\n2月25日，疾病预防控制中心告诉美国公众准备在国内爆发疫情的第一天，美国国务卿蓬佩奥指责中国通过对医疗专业人员和媒体的“审查”不当处理疫情。\n此后，两国关系恶化，特朗普将冠状病毒贴上“中国病毒”的标签，中国人谴责这种说法是污名化的。上周，中国政府宣布，来自纽约时报、华盛顿邮报和华尔街日报三家美国新闻机构的美国人将被驱逐出中国。\n消息人士对路透表示，在决定取消Quick的工作之际，中国疾控中心在过去两年缩减了在华美国员工的数量。\n“我们已经撤回了许多公共卫生技术专家，”同一位专家.\n不过，疾控中心反驳说，人员配备是一个问题，或其信息受到了这一行动的限制。“不是人员短缺限制了我们的能力，”它说。\n该机构说，美国疾控中心在北京的团队目前包括三名美国公民担任永久职务，另外一名美国人是临时的，约有10名中国公民。在美国人中，有一位是流感专家，对呼吸道疾病有专长。COVID-19不是流感，尽管它可以引起严重的呼吸道疾病。\n疾控中心的小组，除了Quick，被安置在美国大使馆的设施。消息人士说，除了Quick之外，没有一名美国疾控中心的工作人员与中国的疾病控制机构有联系。\n近几周来，中国报告称，由于采取了严厉的遏制措施，包括对拥有6000万人口的湖北省实施封锁，新案件数量急剧下降。\n尽管如此，接受路透社采访的传染病专家说，美国可以利用像Quick这样的人在当地进行接触，特别是在第二波传染病的恐惧出现时。\n美国疾病预防控制中心（CDC）前主任托马斯弗里登（Thomas R.Frieden）说，如果美国常驻顾问仍在中国，“我们今天可能会更多地了解这种冠状病毒是如何传播的，以及什么最有效地阻止它。”\n医学流行病学家乔治康威博士（George Conway）知道得很快，曾在2012年至2015年期间担任驻地顾问。他说，由于美国卫生官员就中国是否应该为自己的培训项目出资展开长期争论，多年来，这一职位的资金一直很薄弱。\n然而，据知情人士透露，自2001年启动这项培训计划以来，它不仅加强了中国流行病学家在这一领域的队伍，而且还促进了两国公共卫生官员之间的合作关系。\n康威说：“我们作为有资格的外交官去那里，然后作为亲密的同事和朋友回家。.\n2007年，疾控中心流行病学家、担任顾问职务时间最长的美国官员之一罗伯特·方丹博士因其作为外国人在帮助发现和调查不明原因的肺炎集群方面的贡献，获得了中国对公共卫生做出杰出贡献的最高荣誉。\n但弗里登等人表示，自去年以来，特朗普政府与中国领导人之间日益紧张的关系显然损害了双方的合作。\n弗里登说：“政府发出的信息是，‘不要与中国合作，他们是我们的竞争对手’。\n特朗普的连任竞选团队周日晚间发表声明，驳斥了有关疾控中心削减开支的争议，认为这是一个政治问题。\n声明说：“民主党急于将冠状病毒危机政治化，并将其武器化以对抗特朗普总统。“他们这样做是站在中国一边，为北京的掩盖提供掩护。",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Reuters) - It has been only three months since reports first emerged from China of an unknown virus causing unusual cases of pneumonia, and scientists and public health experts already know more about it and how it works than at the same point in earlier outbreaks.\nBut there’s still a lot they don’t know.\nAs the new coronavirus continues to spread around the world, here are some of the most important questions researchers and doctors – as well as policymakers and economists – are still trying to answer:\nHow contagious is the virus?\nThe virus spreads from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth via coughing or sneezing, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It can persist on most surfaces up to several days, so in addition to directly inhaling the virus, you can become infected by touching something that has been contaminated and then touching your own nose, mouth or eyes. There is some evidence that virus particles in the feces of an infected person can transmit the disease through contact, but that remains unconfirmed.\nHow many people are infected, and how many do not show any symptoms?\nSo far, more than 550,000 cases have been reported worldwide, of which more than 127,000 have recovered and more than 24,000 have died. Some researchers estimate that up to 80% of people who are infected show no or only mild symptoms and may not even know they are sick. That would put the number of people who might have been infected in the millions. But we need many more studies and much more testing to close in on a more accurate number.\nGraphic: Tracking the spread of the coronavirus, here\nAre younger people less likely to die from the virus?\nYounger people, while less vulnerable, can still develop COVID-19 - the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus -  severe enough to require hospitalization. Just how much safer they are is still unanswered. The WHO says older people with pre-existing conditions - such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease - appear to develop serious illness more often than others, while a U.S. health official said the mortality rate in males appears to be twice that of women in every age group. Health officials have cautioned that anyone with those underlying conditions, as well as those with weakened immune systems, are at increased risk.\nCan people be re-infected?\nThis is a key question – and we don’t yet know the answer. There are a handful of cases of possible “reinfection” in recovered patients. But most scientists believe those are more likely to have been relapses. A patient may feel better and test negative for the virus in their nose and throat, while the virus remains elsewhere in their body. Fully recovered patients have antibodies in their blood that should protect them from fresh infection, but we don’t know how long those antibodies will last. With some viruses, antibodies fade faster. Even if they do persist, SARS-CoV-2 might undergo small changes over time, as flu viruses do each year, rendering the antibodies ineffective.\nSeveral academic laboratories and medical companies are looking to produce blood tests to figure out who has been exposed to the virus and whether some people have developed immunity. Serological testing will also give a better picture of the full extent of the pandemic.\nDo we know when there will be treatments or a vaccine?\nNo. So far there are no vaccines or antiviral medicines specific to the new coronavirus. Treatment for now focuses on relieving symptoms such as breathing assistance. Companies around the world are racing to develop vaccines. A few have launched early safety testing in humans, but experts say it could take a year or more to develop and test a vaccine. Another complication: viruses can mutate quickly. Some scientists have already identified subtle changes since SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China, in December. But recent studies show the virus is relatively stable, which suggests vaccines should still be effective when they become available.\nDoes the virus spread more slowly in hot places?\nSome experts had hoped that the onset of summer will naturally slow the virus. But the European Centre for Disease Control said on Wednesday that it is unlikely to diminish its spread. The WHO has also said that the virus can be transmitted in all areas, including hot and humid climates.\nHow long will the pandemic last?\nWe don’t know. It will depend on a range of factors, from how long people continue to isolate and avoid group gatherings to when effective drugs or a vaccine become available. President Donald Trump said this week that he hopes to “reopen” the U.S. economy by Easter Sunday on April 12. But he has faced criticism that such a timetable is too rushed and could lead to more people dying. In Hubei province, the epicenter of China’s coronavirus outbreak, life has started to return to normal after two months of lockdown. It remains to be seen whether such a return to normal spurs another outbreak.\nDoes the amount of exposure to the virus determine how sick someone gets?\nViruses enter the body and infect cells, using them as factories to make many millions of copies of themselves, so the number of virus particles that first enter the body has little effect on the eventual amount of virus in the system. At the same time, more frequent exposure does increase the chance that the virus will enter the body in the first place.\nWhen will the economy return to normal?\nThe International Monetary Fund expects the pandemic will cause a global recession in 2020 that could be worse than the one triggered by the 2008 financial crisis. The depth of a recession, how long it will last and the nature of the recovery are a matter of debate. Economists say it will largely depend on how long the lockdowns last – around a quarter of all humanity is currently in lockdown – and how far government support goes in helping individuals, businesses and markets survive the crisis.\nAre the trillions of dollars in emergency spending helping?\nCentral bank measures have sought to keep financial markets functioning, including areas that keep the real economy humming, such as the markets where companies go to raise short term cash to pay staff and where cities go to raise money for roads and schools. Steps taken by governments, such as the $2 trillion U.S. stimulus package, are expected to further help the economy by putting cash in the hands of individuals and providing additional funding to small businesses and companies. Such measures still need to work through the system, however, and it remains unclear whether they will be enough.\nIs it a good time to invest?\nSome investors and bank strategists are starting to look at whether people should buy back into the world’s stock markets, which have plunged some 25% from their highs in February. U.S. hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said this week he had turned increasingly positive on stocks and credit and was “redeploying our capital in companies we love at bargain prices that are built to withstand this crisis.” But with all the uncertainties, many more analysts and investors remain shy about calling the bottom of the market.\nGraphic: COVID-19 in the United States, here\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has a significant deficit in hospital beds, medical staff and intensive care facilities as health experts warn that it is primed to become a new epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data reviewed by Reuters.\nHealth experts say Indonesia faces a surge in coronavirus cases after a slow government response masked the scale of the outbreak in the world’s fourth most populous country.\nIndonesia has recorded 686 cases but the data is seen as understating the scale of infections because of a low rate of testing and a high mortality rate. Indonesia has reported 55 deaths, the highest in Southeast Asia.\nA study by the London-based Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases released on Monday estimates that as few as 2% of Indonesia’s coronavirus infections have been reported. That would bring the true number to as many as 34,300, which is more than Iran.\nOther modellers are projecting that cases could rise to as many as 5 million in the capital, Jakarta, by the end of April under a worst-case scenario.\n“We have lost control, it has already spread everywhere,” Ascobat Gani, a public health economist told Reuters. “Maybe we will follow Wuhan or Italy. I think we are in the range of that”.\nThe government says the impact of the virus will not be that severe.\n“We won’t be like that,” said Achmad Yurianto, a senior health ministry official, referring to comparisons with outbreaks in Italy and China.\n“What’s important is that we rally the people ... they have to keep their distance.”\nIndonesia’s health system compares poorly with those in other countries hit hard by the virus.\nThe country of more than 260 million people has 321,544 hospital beds, according to health ministry data. That is about 12 beds per 10,000 people. South Korea has 115 per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nIn 2017, the WHO found Indonesia had four doctors per 10,000 people. Italy had 10 times more, on a per capita basis. South Korea has six times more doctors.\nYurianto said with proper social distancing measures there should not be a need for a large number of additional beds and that medical staffing was sufficient to tackle the virus.\nHowever, Budi Haryanto, an epidemiologist from the University of Indonesia, told Reuters: “The hospitals are not ready to support the potential cases. Treatment will be limited.”\nAlthough only hundreds of people have been hospitalised for coronavirus, doctors told Reuters the health system was already under strain. Many health staff lack protective equipment, with one doctor telling Reuters how she had to wear a raincoat because there were no coveralls available.\nIn a sign of poor infection controls in hospitals and clinics, eight doctors and one nurse have died from the  coronavirus, according to the Indonesian Doctors Association.\nIn Italy, where there have been 6,077 coronavirus deaths, 23 doctors have died.\nStaff at one hospital on the outskirts of Jakarta had threatened not to come to work on Tuesday because of a lack of protective equipment, another doctor told Reuters.\n“We bring our own masks, our own suits that may not be of standard quality,” the doctor told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n“My friends, one by one, catch the virus,” he said, holding back tears.\nThe government said this week it had sourced 175,000 new sets of protective equipment for medical staff that would be distributed across the country.\nA new emergency hospital has been opened in Jakarta with an eventual capacity to treat up to 24,000 patients. Doctors and medical staff have been promised bonuses and 500,000 rapid testing kits have arrived from China.\nIndonesia’s health system is highly decentralised, making it hard for the central government to coordinate its response across a sprawling archipelago of some 19,000 islands spanning 5,100 km.\nA lack of intensive care unit (ICU) beds also worries experts, especially as the country enters peak dengue fever season, which adds to demand for the facilities.\n“If you are critically ill and you can get into ICU and get put on a ventilator, most people should survive,” said Archie Clements, a public health specialist from Perth’s Curtin University, referring to people infected with the coronavirus.\n“If you don’t get them into ICU and get them on a ventilator, then they will die.”\nA study in the Critical Care Medicine journal in January, which compared intensive care beds for adults in Asian countries using 2017 data, found Indonesia had 2.7 critical care beds per 100,000 people, among the lowest in the region.\n(This story corrects name of Budi Haryanto in paragraph 14)\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK/ LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - New York state suffered another quick and brutal rise in the number of COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, staggering hospitals at the U.S. epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic, as California said it could be facing the next major wave of the disease.\nIn New York City, the densely packed home of more than 8 million people, healthcare officials tried to find hospital beds for the surging number of coronavirus patients as the statewide death toll rose to 210, with more than 25,600 confirmed cases.\nThe White House advised anyone who has visited or left New York to isolate themselves.\n“Everybody who was in New York should be self-quarantining for the next 14 days to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread to others, no matter where they have gone, whether it’s Florida, North Carolina or out to far reaches of Long Island,” Deborah Birx, who is helping lead the White House coronavirus tax force, said at a late-afternoon press conference.\nThe expected need for hospital beds in New York state at the peak of the outbreak has spiraled to 140,000, nearly three times what are available. Infections were now doubling every three days in New York and the worst could still be two to three weeks away, said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.\nNationwide, COVID-19, which broke out late last year in Wuhan, China, has infected more than 53,000 people and killed at least 720.\nPresident Donald Trump declared major disasters for New York and Washington state, the nation’s first hot spot and accounting for at least 117 deaths, and said he would soon do the same for California.\n“We are enduring a great national trial,” Trump said. The president softened a vow to reopen the nation’s economy by Easter, saying he’ll listen to experts first, including Birx and Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nIn California, where 51 people have died and 2,200 tested positive, Governor Gavin Newsom said fully half the confirmed cases were between the ages of 18 and 49, figures he said are “a reminder for everybody to take this seriously.”\nNewsom cited the death of a teenage boy in Los Angeles County, although health officials there said the case was complex and an “alternate explanation” is possible.\nNewsom, who warned that half of Californians - or about 25 million people - could potentially be infected in the coming two months, said the next six to eight weeks would be pivotal in determining whether a clampdown on residents has slowed the spread of coronavirus.\nCalifornia also desperately lacks the hospital beds it needs to care for so many critically ill patients, Newsom has said, although Tesla co-founder Elon Musk “came through on his promise” to deliver over 1,000 badly needed hospital ventilators, and the state brought another 3,000 online.\nThe U.S. Navy hospital ship Mercy was expected to arrive at in Los Angeles on Friday with 1,000 hospital beds to ease the burden on the state’s healthcare system.\nDespite the crisis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1933 after U.S. lawmakers said they were close to a deal for a massive economic rescue package in response to the outbreak.\nThe World Health Organization said on Tuesday the United States had the potential to become the global epicenter of the pandemic, citing a “very large acceleration” in coronavirus infections.\nDemocrats, including Governor Cuomo, have criticized Trump, a Republican, for suggesting he would reopen the nation’s economy by mid-April.\n“If you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy, then it’s no contest. No American is going to say accelerate the economy at the cost of human life,” Cuomo said earlier in the day.\nNewsom did not criticize Trump but said April would be “sooner than any of the experts that I’ve talked to would believe is possible” for California to lift its restrictions.\nThe governors of at least 18 states in recent days have issued stay-at-home directives. The sweeping orders, unprecedented in their breadth and depth, encompass about half the nation’s population.\nThe rules are based on social distancing principles designed to put more space between individuals in order to slow the spread of the highly contagious and potentially lethal virus.\nEven before the first statewide controls went into effect last week in California, the coronavirus pandemic had virtually paralyzed sectors of the U.S. economy and upended daily lives of Americans as school districts and colleges canceled classes.\nAmericans reported frayed nerves after days of working from home, unable to take part in many activities and looking after children with no schools to attend.\nTerri Gilbert Thompson, 44, and her husband Scott, both teachers in Hilltown, Pennsylvania juggled teaching remotely with homeschooling their own three children.\n“It has been a challenge, but we are willing to make it work to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread,” Thompson said. “We’re doing our best to keep our students engaged in learning, monitor and enrich our own kids’ learning, while maintaining our own sanity during this challenging time.”\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Several months before the coronavirus pandemic began, the Trump administration eliminated a key American public health position in Beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in China, Reuters has learned.\nThe American disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China’s disease control agency, left her post in July, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November, and as cases exploded, the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to help.\n“It was heartbreaking to watch,” said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. “If someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.”\nZhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr. Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.  As an American CDC employee, they said, Quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the United States and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier.\nNo other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Quick left in July, according to the sources. Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts.\nZhu and the other sources said Quick could have provided real-time information to U.S. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the Chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments.\nQuick left amid a bitter U.S. trade dispute with China when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the U.S. Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, would be discontinued as of September, the sources said. The U.S. CDC said it first learned of a “cluster of 27 cases of pneumonia” of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31.\nSince then, the outbreak of the disease known as COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. The epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems some countries, including Italy, and threatens to do so in the United States and elsewhere.\nIn a statement to Reuters, the U.S. CDC said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder Washington’s ability to get information and “had absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier.”\nThe agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser “started well before last summer and was due to China’s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.”\nThe CDC said it has assigned two of its Chinese employees as “mentors” to help with the training program. The agency did not respond to questions about the mentors’ specific role or expertise.\n“CDC has had a 30-year partnership with China CDC and close collaboration,” the statement said. “We had the right staff to engage China and ability to provide technical assistance were it requested.”\nThe CDC would not make Quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment.\nAsked for comment on Chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred Reuters to remarks by spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday. Geng said the country “has adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (World Health Organization) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.”\nOne disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government’s suppression of information.\n“In the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn’t have had made a big difference,” Scott McNabb, who was a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at Emory University. “The problem was how the Chinese handled it. What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn’t.”\nAlex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS)said Friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early January, based on Redfield’s conversations with “Chinese colleagues.”\nRedfield learned that “this looks to be a novel coronavirus” from Dr. Gao Fu, the head of the China CDC, according to an HHS administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Dr. Redfield always talked to Dr. Gao,” the official said.\nHHS and CDC did not make Azar or Redfield available for comment.\nZhu and other sources said U.S. leaders should not have been relying on the China CDC director for alerts and updates. In general, they said, officials in China downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until Jan. 20.\nAfter the epidemic exploded and China had imposed strict quarantines, Trump administration officials complained that the Chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the United States had been unable to get American disease experts into the country to help contain the spread.\nAzar told CNN on Feb. 14 that he and CDC director Redfield officially offered to send a CDC team into China on Jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. HHS oversees the CDC.\n“Dr. Redfield and I made the offer on January 6th - 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,” Azar said. “We made the offer to send the CDC experts in to assist their Chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? What is the severity? What is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?”\nDays later, the World Health Organization secured permission to send a team that included two U.S. experts. The team visited between Feb. 16th and 24th. By then, China had reported more than 75,000 cases.\nOn Feb. 25, the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak at home, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its “censorship” of medical professionals and media.\nRelations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as Trump has labeled the coronavirus the “Chinese virus” - a description the Chinese have condemned as stigmatizing. Last week, the Chinese government announced that Americans from three U.S. news organizations, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, would be expelled from China.\nThe decision to eliminate Quick’s job came as the CDC has scaled back the number of U.S. staffers in China over the last two years, the sources told Reuters.\n“We had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,”  the same expert said.\nThe CDC, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move.  “It was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability” it said.\nThe U.S. CDC team in Beijing now includes three American citizens in permanent roles, an additional American who is temporary and around 10 Chinese nationals, the agency said. Of the Americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. Coronavirus is not influenza, though it is a respiratory disease.\nThe CDC team, aside from Quick, was housed at U.S. Embassy facilities. No American CDC staffer besides Quick was embedded with China’s disease control agency, the sources said.\nChina in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people. Nevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with Reuters said, the United States could use people like Quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes.\nThomas R. Frieden, a former director of the CDC, said that if the U.S. resident adviser had still been in China, “it is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.”\nDr. George Conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows Quick and had served as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among U.S health officials over whether China should be paying for funding its own training program.\nYet since the training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of Chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries.\n“We go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,” Conway said.\nIn 2007, Dr. Robert Fontaine, a CDC epidemiologist  and one of the longest serving U.S. officials in the adviser’s position, received China’s highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause.\nBut since last year, Frieden and others said, growing tensions between the Trump administration and China’s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration.\n“The message from the administration was, ‘Don’t work with China, they’re our rival,’” Frieden said.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "路透华盛顿3月22日电---路透获悉，在冠状病毒大流行开始前几个月，特朗普政府取消了美国在北京的一个重要公共卫生职位，该职位旨在帮助发现中国爆发的疾病。\n据四位知情人士透露，这位美国疾病专家是中国疾病控制机构的一名医学流行病学家，今年7月离职。新冠状病毒的首批病例可能早在11月就已经出现，随着病例的爆发，特朗普政府在2月就斥责中国审查有关疫情的信息，阻止美国专家进入中国提供帮助。\n2007年至2011年间，美国疾病预防控制中心（U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention）资助了担任这一职务的华裔朱宝平（Bao Ping Zhu），他说：“看到这一幕令人心碎。“如果有人在场，全世界的公共卫生官员和政府可能会行动得更快。”\n朱和其他消息来源说，美国专家琳达·奎克博士是中国现场流行病学家的培训师，他们被派往疫情中心，帮助追踪、调查和控制疾病。他们说，作为美国疾控中心的一名员工，Quick处于一个理想的位置，可以成为美国和其他国家在冠状病毒爆发时的耳目，并可能在几周前提醒他们注意日益增长的威胁。\n据消息人士透露，在Quick于7月离开后，没有其他外国疾病专家参与领导该项目。朱镕基说，在与中国同行建立密切关系之后，一位嵌入式专家往往可以很早得到疫情爆发的消息。\n朱和其他消息来源说，Quick可以向美国提供实时信. 以及世界各地的其他官员在疫情爆发的头几周表示，中国政府严厉打击信息发布，并提供了错误的评估。\n消息人士说，在美国与中国激烈的贸易争端中，她得知自己在中国的联邦资助职位（官方称为美国现场流行病学培训项目驻中国顾问）将于9月停止工作，于是迅速离开。美国疾控中心说，他们于12月31日在中国武汉首次发现了一个来源不明的“27例肺炎病例群”。\n此后，这种被称为COVID-19的疾病在全球迅速蔓延，造成13600多人死亡，317000多人感染。这一流行病已经使包括意大利在内的一些国家的医疗体系不堪重负，并威胁到美国和其他地方的医疗体系。\n美国疾控中心在向路透社发表的一份声明中说，取消顾问职位并不妨碍华盛顿获取信息的能力，“与疾控中心没有更早了解中国的病例完全无关”\n该机构表示，其决定不设常驻顾问“早在去年夏天就开始了，这是因为中国的技术能力和项目的成熟。”\n中国疾控中心表示，已指派两名中国员工作为“导师”协助培训计划。该机构没有回答有关导师具体角色或专业知识的问题。\n声明说：“中国疾控中心与中国疾控中心建立了30年的合作关系，并进行了密切合作。”。“我们有合适的工作人员与中国接触，如果中国提出要求，我们有能力提供技术援助。”\n疾控中心不愿让仍在该机构工作的Quick发表评论。\n当被要求就中国对疫情的透明度和反应发表评论时，中国外交部援引路透社发言人耿爽周五的讲. 耿雁生说，中国“以公开、透明、负责任的方式，采取了最严格、最全面、最彻底的防控措施，及时向（世界卫生组织）和有关国家和地区通报了最新情况。”\n一位疾病专家对路透社表示，鉴于中国政府对信息的压制，他怀疑这位美国常驻顾问是否能够更早或更好地向特朗普政府获取信息。\n“最终，根据中国的情况，这可能不会有太大的改变，”斯科特·麦克纳布说，他是疾控中心的流行病学家，20年了，现在是埃默里大学的研究教授。“问题是中国人是如何处理的。应该改变的是，中国人应该早一点承认，而不是。”\n美国卫生与公众服务部（HHS）部长阿历克斯•阿扎尔（Alex Azar）上周五表示，根据雷德菲尔德与“中国同事”的谈话，他的机构在1月初得知了冠状病毒\n据一位不愿透露姓名的卫生部官员透露，雷德菲尔德从中国疾控中心主任高福博士那里得知，“这看起来是一种新型冠状病毒”。“雷德菲尔德医生总是和高医生说话，”这位官员说。\n卫生部和疾病预防控制中心没有让Azar或Redfield发表评论。\n朱镕基和其他消息人士说，美国领导人不应该依赖中国疾控中心主任发出警报和更新。他们说，总的来说，中国官员在最初几周低估了疫情的严重性，直到1月20日才承认有人与人之间传播的证据。\n疫情爆发后，中国实施了严格的隔离措施，特朗普政府官员抱怨说，中国审查了有关疫情的信息，美国无法让美国疾病专家入境帮助遏制疫情蔓延。\n阿扎尔2月2日对美国有线电视新闻网. 14日，他和疾控中心主任雷德菲尔德正式提出，将于1月6日派遣一支疾控中心小组进入中国，但仍未获得允许他们进入中国。卫生部监督疾病预防控制中心。\n阿扎尔说：“雷德菲尔德医生和我在1月6日至36天前提出了这个提议，6万例病例和1300例死亡。“我们提出让疾控中心的专家来帮助他们的中国同事弄清关键的科学问题，比如，这种疾病是如何传播的？严重程度如何？潜伏期是多少，会不会有无症状的传播？”\n几天后，世界卫生组织获得了派遣一个由两名美国专家组成的小组的许可。该队在2月16日至24日期间访问过。到那时，中国已经报告了75000多起病例。\n2月25日，疾病预防控制中心告诉美国公众准备在国内爆发疫情的第一天，美国国务卿蓬佩奥指责中国通过对医疗专业人员和媒体的“审查”不当处理疫情。\n此后，两国关系恶化，特朗普将冠状病毒贴上“中国病毒”的标签，中国人谴责这种说法是污名化的。上周，中国政府宣布，来自纽约时报、华盛顿邮报和华尔街日报三家美国新闻机构的美国人将被驱逐出中国。\n消息人士对路透表示，在决定取消Quick的工作之际，中国疾控中心在过去两年缩减了在华美国员工的数量。\n“我们已经撤回了许多公共卫生技术专家，”同一位专家说。\n不过，疾控中心反驳说，人员配备是一个问题，或其信息受到了这一行动的限制。“不是人员短缺限制了我们的能力，”它说。\n该机构说，美国疾控中心在北京的团队目前包括三名美国公民担任永久职务，另外一名美国人是临时的，约有10名中国公. 在美国人中，有一位是流感专家，对呼吸道疾病有专长。冠状病毒不是流感，尽管它是一种呼吸道疾病。\n疾控中心的小组，除了Quick，被安置在美国大使馆的设施。消息人士说，除了Quick之外，没有一名美国疾控中心的工作人员与中国的疾病控制机构有联系。\n近几周来，中国报告称，由于采取了严厉的遏制措施，包括对拥有6000万人口的湖北省实施封锁，新案件数量急剧下降。尽管如此，接受路透社采访的传染病专家说，美国可以利用像Quick这样的人在当地进行接触，特别是在第二波传染病的恐惧出现时。\n美国疾病预防控制中心（CDC）前主任托马斯弗里登（Thomas R.Frieden）说，如果美国常驻顾问仍在中国，“我们今天可能会更多地了解这种冠状病毒是如何传播的，以及什么最有效地阻止它。”\n医学流行病学家乔治康威博士（George Conway）知道得很快，曾在2012年至2015年期间担任驻地顾问。他说，由于美国卫生官员就中国是否应该为自己的培训项目出资展开长期争论，多年来，这一职位的资金一直很薄弱。\n然而，据知情人士透露，自2001年启动这项培训计划以来，它不仅加强了中国流行病学家在这一领域的队伍，而且还促进了两国公共卫生官员之间的合作关系。\n康威说：“我们作为有资格的外交官去那里，然后作为亲密的同事和朋友回国。\n2007年，疾病预防控制中心流行病学家、担任顾问职务时间最长的美国官员之一罗伯特·方丹博士因其作为外国人在帮助发现和调查不明原因的肺炎群方面的贡献，获得了中国对公共卫生杰出贡献的最高荣.\n但弗里登等人表示，自去年以来，特朗普政府与中国领导人之间日益紧张的关系显然损害了双方的合作。\n弗里登说：“政府发出的信息是，‘不要与中国合作，他们是我们的竞争对手’。\n白宫没有立即回应置评请求。（泰勒在华盛顿报道；托尼·门罗在北京撰稿",

The legendary Viswanathan Anand's return to India has been put on hold over the restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic. He is expected to \"wait and watch\" with regard to his travel plans.Anand would also be busy with his commentary stint for a website for the FIDE Candidates tournament beginning in Russia on Tuesday.Meanwhile, India's No 4 chess player Adhiban Baskaran, who is back in India after playing three back-to-back tournaments, is happy that he would be getting a break.\"I am a bit tired after playing back-to-back tournaments. First I want to take rest and be at home with my family. Then I will train. I needed a break but I didn't expect to be for two to three months!\"Apart from training, I will be playing online tournaments,\" he added.Adhiban had played the Gibraltar Open and the Aeroflot Open in Moscow and in between featured in the national team championship.The Indian women's No 2 D Harika, who recently participated in the FIDE Women's GP Series event in Lausanne, Switzerland is back in the country and wants to use the break to train.\"Yeah, it will be a break and I will use this time for to work on chess and train myself. The (chess) Olympiad will be the next major event,\" she said from Hyderabad.Meanwhile, the 13-year old D Gukesh, the world's second youngest Grandmaster ever, said with all tournaments till April-end being cancelled, the focus will be on training.\"All planned tournaments till April-end have been cancelled. So just concentrating on training at the moment and see how things progress. Once things settle down, have to re-plan everything,\" the Chennai player said.The country's top paddlers -- A Sharath Kamal and G Sathiyan -- both residents of Chennai, will look to use the time to train in the city.While Sharath said he would wait till things calm down, Sathiyan, who is returning to the city later Monday, said he planed to practice and also enjoy time with the family.\"Yes.. training at home and I think it is a good window to spend time with family, eat mom's food, train at home centre and improve on skills and fitness,\" the 27-year old Sathiyan said.The deadly coronavirus outbreak, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has so far led to over 6.000 deaths globally and over 110 cases in India.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "\nShe trained at the KEM and Nair hospitals in Mumbai and spent three years doing her fellowship in infectious disease at Harvard. Dr Gilada has won a global award for HIV research.\nThe coronavirus epidemic, or for that matter any epidemic, that spreads from one country to the other, goes through different stages.\nStage One of the epidemic is when the cases are found only among people who travelled to that country (that had the viral outbreak).\nStage Two is when we find cases amongst contacts of these travellers.\nAnd Stage Three is when the disease has come into the community, which means that it's not just in the travellers or their contacts. It's also now in the general community, which means that now, if we were to screen only those who were travellers or contacts, we would miss a lot of cases.\nSo at this point, we (in India) are just between (Stages) Two and Three, because all the recent cases, that we have found, have only been in travellers or in their contacts. But we also know that what we find is probably just part of the cases.\nSo once the neighbour has acquired it, it is community spread.\nThat's true.\nIn a lot of cases, you will be able to just go back and see that: 'Oh so this person got it from the neighbour's house and the neighbour was in touch with this person'.\nBut once we skip, when three or four steps have gone (missing), and there is no way to go and say where did that happen from?\nAnd once that happens, that is the point where -- if you've seen the graph of any epidemic -- that is the time when the graph starts rising ie when it's community spread.\nWe are. Even now, they have always been able to track down the contacts and who these cases have been in touch with.\nBut we know that is not going to be like this for another one week. We know it is going to spill out into the community a bit.\nThe whole thing of social distancing is because we anticipate community spread.\nIf we were not anticipating community spread, there was no need of social distancing. Then just screening travellers and quarantining them and asking them to get self-isolated would have been enough.\nThe entire fact that we are all really, really urging on social distancing means that we anticipate that there is going to be community spread.\nSo in a lot of ways, we are slow.\nWe still want to think that we are doing everything up to the mark. And we are extremely well prepared for the epidemic -- which isn't true.\nWe aren't extremely well prepared for the epidemic. We are only saying that because we're still at (low fatality) numbers.\nIt is a good thing to think that way and say it in the papers.\nThey know that they are not well prepared.\nAt least in MCGM (the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai), and or in Bombay, we know that they are really taking a lot of proactive steps and are already planning for weeks ahead.\nLike they are coming up with plans that if this epidemic really blows up, what will be the other labs that will be open for testing, and what will be the other hospitals that will be utilised.\nBut we also know, it's not just about getting the infrastructure ready. It's also about retraining a lot of manpower to handle this epidemic in the right way.\nSo we really need to accept that we are in for a disaster in the next two weeks if we really don't do what a lot of other countries did in a very, very regulated and a strict manner. Like if you see what happened in Wuhan, they really, really had a very bad peak with the epidemic.\nBut if you see the rest of China they were beautiful in what they did. They did see huge numbers and they did see a lot of deaths. But they were able to do that they were able to curve that epidemic in a span of one-and-a-half to two months.\nWill we be able to do that if the epidemic comes to our country?\nWe know the answer is no.\nIf we really cannot handle an epidemic of that strata, (causing that kind) of excessive calamity, then we really have to prevent it. Then if we become complacent in even preventing it, then we are actually in for a disaster.\nPeople really worship politicians in India. They really worship (Prime Minister) Narendra (Damodardas) Modi and they worship some chief ministers.\nSo I think this is the time, that if they really come out and say that Narendra Modi is going to address the people of India at 8 pm tonight, it's like a big thing.\nAnd if he tells people to: 'Please stay at home and this is what we really want you to follow', we know it will make a big impact.\nBut this is not the first time. We know that health and education really doesn't receive that kind of priority or attention or response from politicians the way it should. I hope at this point, some good sense will prevail.\nHow do you know coronavirus is on your cell phone?\nThere is no way to say where coronavirus is at this point in time.\nYou should just assume that coronavirus is on surfaces that are being touched by several people, door handles, cabs and whatever.\nYou know, in our in sub-conscious mind, we just need to keep thinking that this virus is everywhere, which will really make us follow hand hygiene religiously.\nIt's not that difficult to kill the virus. Any disinfectant which is either alcohol- or bleach-based is enough to disinfect surfaces.\nSoap, water, bleach. Sterillium that we use. You can take some sterillium on a tissue or cotton and clean your cellphone. Little things. That's enough.\nThere are four qualities that decide how bad the disease is going to be.\nOne is the mode of spread. So any disease that spreads through respiratory secretions always tends to spread faster. Because the virus is there in the cough and the sneeze, and it's extremely difficult to have 100 per cent hand hygiene or cough etiquette.\nThe second is the infectiousness of the virus. And that is like an innate quality or that's like a personality of each virus.\nThere is something called R0 (basic reproductive rate) which decides how infectious each virus is going to be. And that number technically means that during the disease period, in any patient, how many other people will this patient infect.\nSo the R0 for coronavirus 19, the SARC-CoV2, is around three.\nNow, if you see a lot of other viral diseases, like for HIV, for that matter, the R0 for HIV is also three.\nSo you will think what's so different?\nBut the HIV positive person will infect three people in the course of the disease, which is an entire lifetime.\nIn contrast, someone with COVID-19 will infect three people, in the course of the disease, which is only 10 days. That means it's such a short span of time, three people will keep getting infected.\nNow, if three people get infected, and each of these infects another three, that's nine, and then another three it’s 27. So it's like exponential.\nAnd because it's in such a short span of time, within like a matter of months, we've really crossed huge numbers.\nNow that is the infectiousness of the virus. And that's the reason why this entire concept of social distancing, because, we believe, that if someone who's infected with the virus actually doesn't come in contact with that many people, we are basically trying to bring down the R0.\nSo instead of three people getting infected, we really want zero or one person to get infected, so that's the aim (with regard to) the infectiousness of the virus.\nAnd the third quality of the virus is the mortality rate or the case fatality rate. And the case fatality rate is out of hundred people who get infected with COVID-19, how many of them are going to succumb to COVID-19.\nAnd this case fatality rate, if you see, this number has changed from country to country like South Korea clearly has a very low case fatality rate.\nWhat China saw was between 2 to 4 per cent. The fatality rate in South Korea was 1 per cent.\nWhat we are actually seeing in Italy is around 6 per cent.\nYes. So the case fatality rate also depends on a lot of things. It depends on what the age structure of the population is, how good your healthcare system is.\nSometime the healthcare system will be great. But if it is over-challenged, so there are just too many people reaching the healthcare system beyond what the hospital can handle, then the entire system just collapses.\nSo if I was to receive five people in the ICU, I can offer really good care to five. But instead of five if I start receiving 15 on the same day, then I know that the care will be compromised.\nAnd that's the reason why they really want to flatten the curve (COVID-19 case curve). That's the entire concept of flattening the curve -- you don't want that peak to be really high.\nThe higher the peak, the more number of people who will reach the hospital and the more over-burdend the health system will be.\nBecause of this infectiousness: So SARS was like an epidemic that spanned over six months. And even over six months, the cases were not as much as what corona saw just in a matter of one-and-a-half months.\nBut at the same time, it hasn't killed, percentage wise, that many people.\nIn Ebola the fatality rate was 50 per cent and some countries saw 70 and 80 per cent, which was dangerous.\nWith COVID-19, we know that, at most, it has been 5 to 6 per cent.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "她在孟买的KEM和Nair医院接受培训，并在哈佛大学（Harvard）从事传染病研究。吉拉达博士获得了全球艾滋病研究奖。\n冠状病毒的流行，或者说任何从一个国家传播到另一个国家的流行，都经历了不同的阶段。\n这种流行病的第一阶段是只在前往该国（病毒爆发地）的人中发现病例。\n第二阶段是我们在这些旅行者的联系人中发现病例。\n而第三阶段是疾病进入社区的时候，这意味着它不仅仅出现在旅行者或他们的接触者身上。它现在也出现在普通社区，这意味着，如果我们只筛选那些旅行者或联系人，我们会错过很多案例。\n所以在这一点上，我们（在印度）只是处于第二阶段和第三阶段之间，因为我们发现的所有最近的病例，都只是在旅行者或他们的接触中。但我们也知道，我们发现的可能只是案件的一部分。\n因此，一旦邻居获得了它，它就是社区传播。\n那是真的。\n在很多情况下，你可以回去看看：“哦，所以这个人是从邻居家拿到的，而邻居和这个人有联系。”。\n但是一旦我们跳过，当三到四个步骤已经过去（丢失），没有办法去说，这是从哪里发生的？\n一旦发生这种情况，这就是——如果你看过任何流行病的图表——这就是图表开始上升的时间，即当它是社区传播的时候。\n我们是。即使是现在，他们也总能找到这些案件的联系人和联系者。\n但我们知道再过一周就不会这样了。我们知道它会蔓延到社区。\n社会疏远的全部原因是因为我们预料到了社会的蔓.\n如果我们没有预料到社区的蔓延，就没有必要疏远社会。那么，仅仅对旅行者进行检查和隔离，让他们自我隔离就足够了。\n事实上，我们都非常非常强烈地要求与社会保持距离，这意味着我们预计会有社区传播。\n所以在很多方面，我们都很慢。\n我们仍然想认为我们所做的一切都是符合标准的。我们对这种流行病已经做好了充分的准备，但事实并非如此。\n我们对这场流行病没有做好充分的准备。我们这么说只是因为我们的死亡率还很低。\n这样想并在报纸上发表是件好事。\n他们知道他们没有做好准备。\n至少在MCGM（大孟买市政公司）和/或孟买，我们知道他们确实在采取许多积极主动的步骤，并已经计划了几个星期。\n就像他们正在制定计划，如果这场流行病真的爆发了，将开放供检测的其他实验室是什么，将使用的其他医院是什么。\n但我们也知道，这不仅仅是要准备好基础设施。这也是为了重新培训大量人力，以正确的方式处理这一流行病。\n因此，如果我们真的不能像许多其他国家那样，以非常、非常规范和严格的方式行事，我们真的需要接受，我们将在未来两周面临灾难。就像你看到武汉发生了什么，他们真的，真的有一个非常糟糕的流行高峰。\n但如果你看到中国其他地方，他们的所作所为是美丽的。他们确实看到了大量的死亡病例。但他们能够做到，他们能够在一个半月到两个月的时间内扭转疫情。\n如果疫情蔓延到我国，我们能做到吗？\n我们知道答案是.\n如果我们真的不能处理这个阶层的流行病，（造成那种）过度的灾难，那么我们真的必须防止它。如果我们自满于甚至预防它，那么我们实际上就要面对一场灾难。\n在印度，人们真的崇拜政客。他们真的崇拜（总理）纳兰德拉（达莫达达斯）莫迪，他们崇拜一些首席部长。\n所以我认为现在是时候了，如果他们真的出来说，纳伦德拉·莫迪今晚8点要向印度人民发表讲话，那是件大事。\n如果他告诉人们：‘请呆在家里，这是我们真正希望你遵循的’，我们知道这会产生很大的影响。\n但这不是第一次。我们知道，卫生和教育并没有得到政治家们应有的重视、关注或回应。我希望在这一点上，会有一些好的判断力占上风。\n你怎么知道你手机里有冠状病毒？\n目前还无法确定冠状病毒在哪里。\n你应该假设冠状病毒存在于被几个人、门把手、出租车等接触的表面。\n你知道，在我们潜意识里，我们只需要不断地想，这种病毒无处不在，这真的会让我们虔诚地遵守手卫生。\n杀灭病毒没那么难。任何基于酒精或漂白剂的消毒剂都足以对表面进行消毒。\n肥皂，水，漂白剂。我们用的绝育药。你可以在纸巾或棉花上取些消毒液，然后清洗手机。小事情。够了。\n有四种品质决定了疾病的严重程度。\n一是传播方式。因此，任何通过呼吸道分泌物传播的疾病都往往传播得更快。因为病毒存在于咳嗽和打喷嚏中，要做到100%的手部卫生或咳嗽礼仪是极其困难的。\n第二是病毒的传染. 这就像是一种天生的品质，或者说是每种病毒的个性。\n有一种叫做R0（基本繁殖率）的东西决定了每种病毒的传染性。从技术上讲，这个数字意味着在疾病期间，在任何病人身上，这个病人还会感染多少人。\n所以冠状病毒19的R0，SARC-CoV2，大约是3。\n现在，如果你看到很多其他的病毒性疾病，比如艾滋病，就这个问题来说，艾滋病的R0也是3。\n所以你会觉得有什么不同？\n但HIV阳性者在发病过程中会感染3人，这是一辈子。\n相比之下，携带COVID-19的人会感染三个人，在发病过程中，也就是仅仅10天。这意味着时间很短，三个人会继续感染。\n现在，如果三个人感染了，每一个人又感染了三个人，那就是九个人，然后再感染三个人就是27个人。所以它是指数型的。\n因为它在如此短的时间内，在几个月内，我们真的跨越了巨大的数字。\n这就是病毒的传染性。这就是为什么整个社会距离的概念，因为，我们相信，如果一个感染了病毒的人实际上没有接触到那么多人，我们基本上是在试图降低R0。\n因此，我们真正想要的不是三个人感染，而是零个人或一个人感染，所以这就是病毒的传染性。\n病毒的第三个特性是死亡率或病死率。而病死率是在100名感染COVID-19的人中，有多少人会死于COVID-19。\n而这个病死率，如果你看到的话，这个数字从一个国家变到另一个国家，像韩国，显然病死率很低。\n中国所看到的是2%到4%之. 韩国的死亡率为1%。\n我们在意大利实际看到的是6%左右。\n对。所以病死率也取决于很多因素。这取决于人口的年龄结构，你的医疗体系有多好。\n有时候医疗系统会很好。但如果它受到了过度的挑战，那么有太多的人进入医疗系统，超出了医院所能处理的范围，那么整个系统就会崩溃。\n所以如果我能在重症监护室接待五个人，我可以为五个人提供非常好的护理。但如果我在同一天收到15份，我就不会收到5份，我知道这样的照顾会受到损害。\n这就是为什么他们真的想把曲线变平（COVID-19病例曲线）。这就是曲线平坦化的全部概念——你不希望峰值真的很高。\n高峰越高，到达医院的人数越多，卫生系统负担越重。\n因为这种传染性：所以非典就像一场跨越六个月的流行病。即使超过六个月，这些病例也没有科罗纳在一个半月内看到的那么多。\n但同时，它并没有杀死那么多人。\n在埃博拉，死亡率为50%，有些国家为70%和80%，这是危险的。\n对于COVID-19，我们知道，最多只有5%到6%",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Shares opened sharply higher in Asia on Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to its best day since 1933 with Congress and the White House nearing a deal on injecting nearly $2 trillion of aid into an economy ravaged by the coronavirus.\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 index jumped 5.3 per cent, while Hong Kong added 3 per cent and Sydney climbed 3.6 per cent. Markets across Asia were all up more than 2 per cent.\nThe Dow burst 11.4 per cent higher, while the more closely followed S&P 500 index leaped 9.4 per cent as a wave of buying around the world interrupted what has been a brutal month of nearly nonstop selling. Investors released some frustration that had pent up over days of watching the US Senate stalemate over the crucial rescue package.\nDespite the gains, investors were far from saying markets have hit bottom. Rallies nearly as big as this have punctuated the last few weeks, and none lasted more than a day. Economists and investors alike are still expecting to see some dire economic numbers in the days and weeks ahead.\nToday was a good day, but we would not necessarily see this as turnaround time, said Adam Taback, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank.\nBoth Democrats and Republicans said Tuesday they’re close to agreeing on a massive economic rescue package, which will include payments to US households and aid for small businesses and the travel industry, among other things. A vote in the Senate could come later Tuesday or Wednesday.\nInvestors were imploring Congress to act, particularly as the Federal Reserve has done nearly all it can to sustain markets, including its latest round of extraordinary aid launched Monday.\n\"It’s sort of like, keep the patient alive in the emergency room so you can provide some treatment options,\" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management.\nThe Dow rose 2,112.98 points, its biggest point gain in history, to 20,704.91. The S&P 500, which is much more important to most 401(k) accounts, rose 209.93, or 9.4 per cent, to 2,447.33 for its third-biggest percentage gain since World War II. The Nasdaq composite jumped 557.18 points, or 8.1 per cent, to 7,417.86.\nIn Asia early Wednesday, Tokyo’s Nikkei was at 19,053.40, while the Hang Seng rose to 23,374.57. South Korea’s Kospi gained 4.2 per cent to 1,678.13 and the S&P/ASX 200 picked up 3.6 per cent to 4,906.10. Taiwan’s benchmark jumped 4.4 per cent.\nUS crude oil gained 88 cents to $24.89 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international pricing standard, added 91 cents to $30.65 per barrel.\nIn currency trading, the US dollar was at 110.90 Japanese yen, down from 111.22 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0803 from $1.0790.\nEarlier share rebounds have evaporated. Since stocks began selling off on Feb. 20, the S&P 500 has had six days where it’s risen, and all but one of them were big gains of more than 4 per cent. Afterward, stocks fell an average of 5% the next day.\n\"One of the things to be careful about is thinking this will be the panacea or that this fiscal response will be sufficient,\" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank Wealth Management.\nUltimately, investors say they need to see the number of new infections peak before markets can find a floor. The increasing spread is forcing companies to park airplanes, shut hotels and close restaurants to dine-in customers.\nPresident Donald Trump said Tuesday during a Fox News virtual town hall that he hopes to open up the economy by Easter. Analysts said the pronouncement wasn’t a contributor to the day’s huge rally, which was mostly due to the stimulus hopes.\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. Those with mild illness recover in about two weeks. Severe illness including pneumonia can occur, especially in the elderly and people with existing health problems. Recovery could take six weeks in such cases.\nEconomists are topping each other’s dire forecasts for how much the economy will shrink this spring due to the closures of businesses, and a growing number say a recession seems inevitable.\nSome of the market’s areas hardest hit by the closures, though, led the way higher Tuesday as expectations rose for incoming aid from the US government.\nNorwegian Cruise Lines, MGM Resorts and American Airlines Group were all up at least 33 per cent. Energy companies and banks were also strong, though all remain well below where they were a month ago.\nGovernments and central banks in other countries around the world are unveiling unprecedented levels of support for their economies in an attempt to limit the scale of the upcoming virus-related slump. Germany, a bastion of budgetary discipline, also approved a big fiscal boost.\nThe gains came even as the first reports arrived showing how badly the outbreak is hitting the global economy. In the United States, a preliminary reading on business activity in March showed the steepest contraction on record, going back to 2009. Reports were also gloomy for Europe.\nEveryone was prepared for a set of shockers, and that is precisely what we got, but they are not a surprise, said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. It is at times like this that the market’s propensity to look forward is demonstrated most effectively.\nMore gloomy data is nearly assuredly on the way. On Thursday, economists expect a report to show the number of Americans applying for jobless claims easily set a record last week. Some say the number could be way beyond 1 million, amid a wave of layoffs, topping the prior record of 695,000 set in 1982.\nHelping to lift sentiment in markets was news from China that it is preparing to lift the lockdown in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and from Italy reporting a reduction in the number of new cases and coronavirus-related deaths.\n\"It’s still early days, of course -- perhaps investors can start to envisage life beyond the coronavirus,\" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe. That could make stocks look a little more attractive, although anyone jumping back in now will need to have nerves of steel.\nDespite Tuesday’s big gains, it’s no time to get complacent, said Wells Fargo’s Taback.\n\"We would caution that the danger is not all behind us at this point, he said. We still have not seen numbers that give us an indication of just how bad things are.\"\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "周三，道琼斯工业平均指数（Dow Jones Industrial Average）飙升至1933年以来的最高水平，美国国会和白宫就向受冠状病毒蹂躏的经济体注入近2万亿美元援助接近达成协议，亚洲股市大幅高开。\n日本日经225指数上涨5.3%，香港上涨3%，悉尼上涨3.6%。整个亚洲市场的涨幅均超过2%。\n道琼斯指数暴涨11.4%，紧随其后的标普500指数大涨9.4%，因全球范围内的购买浪潮中断了近一个月来近乎不间断的残酷抛售。投资者释放了一些沮丧情绪，这些沮丧情绪在过去几天里一直被美国参议院在关键救助方案上的僵局所压抑。\n尽管上涨，但投资者远没有说市场已经触底。过去几周，几乎和这一规模相当的反弹不时出现，没有一次超过一天。经济学家和投资者都预计，未来几天和几周内，经济数据仍将十分糟糕。\n富国私人银行（Wells Fargo Private Bank）首席投资官亚当•塔巴克（Adam Taback）表示，今天是个好日子，但我们不一定认为这是一个转折时期。\n民主党和共和党周二都表示，他们接近就一项大规模的经济救援计划达成一致，其中包括向美国家庭付款、对小企业和旅游业的援助等。参议院可能在周二或周三晚些时候进行投票。\n投资者曾恳请国会采取行动，尤其是美联储（fed）已尽其所能维持市场，包括周一推出的最新一轮特别援助。\nNorthern Trust Wealth Management的首席投资官凯蒂•尼克松（Katie Nixon）说：“这有点像，让病人在急诊室里活着，这样你就可以提供一些治疗选择。”。\n道指上涨2112.98点，创历史最大涨幅，至20704.91。标准普尔500指数（S&P 500）上涨209.93点，至2447.33点，涨幅为9.4%，为二战以来的第三大百分比涨幅。标准普尔500指数对多数401（k）账户而言更为重要。纳斯达克综合指数上涨557.18点，至7417.86点，涨幅8.1%。\n周三早盘亚洲股市，东京股市日经指数报19053.40点，恒生指数升至23374.57点。韩国综合股价指数（Kospi）上涨4.2%，至1678.13点，标准普尔/ASX 200指数上涨3.6%，至4906.10点。台湾基准指数上涨4.4%。\n美国原油在纽约商品交易所（New York Mercantile Exchange）电子交易中上涨88美分，至每桶24.89美元。国际定价标准布伦特原油价格上涨91美分，至每桶30.65美元。\n在外汇交易中，美元从周二尾盘的111.22日元跌至110.90日元。欧元从1.0790美元升至1.0803美元。\n早些时候的股价反弹已经蒸发。自2月20日股市开始抛售以来，标准普尔500指数已连续六天上涨，除一天外，其他所有股票都大幅上涨逾4%。随后，隔天股市平均下跌5%。\n美国银行财富管理首席投资官埃里克•弗里德曼（Eric Freedman）表示：“需要谨慎的一点是，我们认为这将是灵丹妙药，或者说，这种财政应对措施将是足够的。”。\n最终，投资者表示，他们需要看到新感染人数达到峰值，然后市场才能找到底部。这种蔓延正迫使企业停飞机、关闭酒店和餐馆，以便在顾客中用餐。\n美国总统特朗普周二在福克斯新闻（Fox News）虚拟市政厅（virtual town hall）表示，他希望在复活节前开放经济。分析人士表示，这一表态并没有对当天的大幅反弹起到推波助澜的作用，这主要是因为人们对刺激经济的希望。\n对大多数人来说，冠状病毒只引起轻微或中度症状，如发烧和咳嗽。那些小病患者大约两周后康. 包括肺炎在内的严重疾病可能发生，特别是在老年人和存在健康问题的人身上。在这种情况下，康复可能需要6周。\n经济学家们对今年春天由于企业倒闭而导致的经济萎缩程度的预测超过了其他人的预测，越来越多的人认为经济衰退似乎是不可避免的。\n不过，受关闭影响最严重的一些市场领域周二领涨，因市场对美国政府将提供援助的预期上升。\n挪威邮轮、米高梅度假村和美国航空集团（American Airlines Group）股价均上涨至少33%。能源公司和银行也表现强劲，不过仍远低于一个月前的水平。\n世界上其他国家的政府和中央银行正公布前所未有的对本国经济的支持力度，试图限制即将到来的病毒相关经济衰退的规模。作为预算纪律的堡垒，德国也批准了一项大规模的财政刺激计划。\n尽管第一批报告显示疫情对全球经济的打击有多严重，但这一数字还是有所上升。在美国，3月份对商业活动的初步解读显示，2009年以来，美国经济出现了有记录以来最严重的收缩。对欧洲来说，报告也很悲观。\nIG首席市场分析师克里斯•波尚（chrisbeuchamp）表示：每个人都准备好了一套鞋带，这正是我们得到的，但这并不令人意外。正是在这种时候，市场的前瞻性得到了最有效的证明。\n更令人沮丧的数据几乎可以肯定地说即将公布。周四，经济学家预计一份报告将显示上周申请失业救济人数轻松创下纪录。有人说，在裁员浪潮中，这一数字可能远远超过100万人，超过1982年创下的69.5万人的纪.\n有消息称，中国正准备解除疫情中心武汉的封锁，意大利报告新病例和冠状病毒相关死亡人数减少，这有助于提振市场情绪。\n欧安达欧洲高级市场分析师克雷格•厄拉姆（Craig Erlam）表示：“当然，现在还为时过早——或许投资者可以开始设想冠状病毒以外的生命。”。这可能会让股市看起来更具吸引力，尽管现在任何一个重返股市的人都需要钢铁般的神经。\n富国银行（Wells Fargo）的塔巴克（Taback）表示，尽管周二大涨，但现在不是自满的时候。\n他说：“我们要提醒的是，目前危险还没有完全过去。我们仍然没有看到数字表明情况有多糟。",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Young German adults hold \"corona parties\" and cough toward older people. A Spanish man leashes a goat to go for a walk to skirt confinement orders. From France to Florida to Australia, kitesurfers, college students and others crowd the beaches.\nTheir defiance of lockdown mandates and scientific advice to fight the coronavirus pandemic has prompted crackdowns by authorities on people trying to escape cabin fever brought on by virus restrictions. In some cases, the virus rebels resist threatening police as officials express outrage over public gatherings that could spread the virus.\n\"Some consider they're little heroes when they break the rules,\" French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said. \"Well, no. You're an imbecile, and especially a threat to yourself.\"\nAfter days of noncompliance by people refusing to stay home and venture out only for essential tasks, France on Friday sent security forces into train stations to prevent people from traveling to their vacation homes, potentially carrying the virus to the countryside or beaches where medical facilities are less robust. The popular Paris walkway along the Seine River was closed and a nightly curfew was imposed in the French Mediterranean city of Nice by Mayor Christian Estrosi, who is infected with the virus.\nFlorida officials closed some of the state's most popular beaches after images of rowdy spring break college crowds appeared on TV for days amid the rising global death toll, which surpassed 13,000 on Sunday. Australia closed Sydney's famous Bondi Beach after police were outraged at pictures of the crowds.\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday that people from 18-to-49 account for more than half of the state's coronavirus cases, warning them \"you're not Superman, and you're not Superwoman.\"\nMany people were not complying with social distancing recommendations to stay away from each other in New York City's vast city park network ahead of a ban on congregating in groups that goes into effect Sunday night, Cuomo said.\n\"You can wind up hurting someone who you love, or hurting someone wholly inadvertently. Social distancing works, and you need social distancing everywhere,\" Cuomo warned.\nAs new coronavirus cases in China dropped to zero several days in a row, the chief medical officer for the International Clinic of Wuhan was alarmed at those elsewhere refusing to follow rules to contain the virus. Dr. Philippe Klein said people should look to China's confinement of tens of millions as an example to emulate \"with courage, with patience, with solidarity.\"\n\"I exhort you, the French, to apply the rules in our way,\" said Klein, who is French.\nWorldwide, over 307,000 people have been infected. For most, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms. But it can cause more severe illness in others, especially older adults and people with existing health conditions. Some 92,000 people have recovered, mostly in China, where the virus first struck late last year.\nThe virus rebels tend to range from restless teens to wealthy adults who can travel to their getaway homes. Even in Italy, where the virus death toll soared beyond China's last week, authorities are still trying to rein in people from going outside for fresh air, sun and visits with friends to escape walled-in lives.\nFrench farmers' markets where people congregate to shop for food have posed a special challenge for police trying to keep people apart from each other at the recommended 2 meters (6 feet), along with neglected urban housing projects where distrust and disobedience of authorities runs deep.\nIn Clichy-Sous-Bois, a Paris suburb where nationwide riots triggered by police harassment allegations erupted in 2005, a person bit a police officer trying to enforce confinement rules, said Linda Kebbab, a police union spokesperson. And a large crowd threatened to spit on officers who had planned to disperse them in the southeastern city of Lyon but left instead, she said.\nIn the southern German state of Bavaria, Gov. Markus Soeder lamented that \"there are still corona parties, there are young people who cough at older people and shout corona for fun and, above all, there are an incredible number of groups being formed.\"\nNational police in Spain, which has the second-highest number of coronavirus infections in Europe after Italy, are using helicopters to spot groups of people meeting up outdoors. Then agents are sent in to break up the gatherings.\nSpanish police have also taken to highlighting examples on social media of what people should not do in public during the country's state of emergency. In the southeastern Murcia region, they posted video of police stopping a person waddling outside in a full-body dinosaur costume and tweeted that pets can be taken for brief walks by owners but that \"having a Tyrannosaurus Rex complex is not\" allowed.\nAnd in Spain's northeastern region of Catalonia, police posted a picture of a man walking a goat on a leash, apparently trying to take advantage of the pet walking exception.\nFrance now has 100,000 security personnel on the streets who are issuing fines amid a new national \"Stay Home\" mantra and warnings by officials that the country's two-week lockdown could be extended if the country's infection rate keeps rising. More than 1.7 million checks were carried out in the last five days and more than 22,500 people fined, the Interior Ministry said. By Sunday, France counted more than 16,000 confirmed infections and 674 deaths.\nIn Greece, the prime minister tried to convince people to say home, warning citizens that future virus prevention measures depend \"on our behavior.\"\nBut after Florida's officials shut down some of the state's famed beaches, some businesses were still trying to draw in tourists, including Clearwater Mega Bite Shark Boat, a 40-foot (12-meter) vessel with a bow shaped like a shark's snout that cruises the Gulf of Mexico off Florida's western coast.\nThe boat can carry 50 passengers but the owner was limiting trips to 10 to comply with federal advice.

        "news_content_translate_en": "The global economy is already in a recession as the hit to economic activity from the coronavirus pandemic has become more widespread, according to economists polled by Reuters amid a raft of central bank stimulus actions this week.\nThe spread of the disease caused by the virus, COVID-19, has sent financial markets into a tailspin despite some of the biggest emergency stimulus measures since the global financial crisis announced by dozens of central banks across Europe, the Americas, Asia and Australia.\nThe panic was clear in stocks, bonds, gold and commodity prices, underlining expectations of severe economic damage from the outbreak.\nMore than three-quarters of economists based in the Americas and Europe polled this week, 31 of 41, said the current global economic expansion had already ended, in response to a question about whether the global economy was already in recession.\n\"Last week we concluded that the COVID-19 shock would produce a global recession as nearly all of the world contracts over the three months between February and April,\" noted Bruce Kasman, head of global economic research at JP Morgan.\n\"There is no longer doubt that the longest global expansion on record will end this quarter. The key outlook issue now is gauging the depth and the duration of the 2020 recession.\"\nEconomists have repeatedly cut their growth outlook over the past month and have increased their forecast probabilities for recession in most major economies.\nThe worst-case views on growth taken just weeks ago in some cases have already into the central scenario for private sector economists in Reuters polls.\n\"The evolving news on COVID-19 has triggered forecast leap frogging,’ with economists and strategists repeatedly lowering their forecasts. Among the big three economies, the US and the euro area will see negative growth, while Chinese growth is expected to come in at a paltry 1.5 per cent,\" said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at BofA.\n\"Our first piece on the virus shock was titled bad or worse’; now we amend that to 'really bad or much worse.' We now expect COVID-19 to cause a global recession in 2020, of similar magnitude to the recessions of 1982 and 2009.\"\nThe global economy was forecast to expand 1.6 per cent this year, about half the 3.1per cent predicted in the January poll, and the weakest since the global financial crisis of 2007-09.\nForecasts for 2020 global GDP ranged from -2.0% to +2.7 per cent.\n\"As cases of coronavirus spiral upward, disruptions to the global economy are increasing. We have cut our global GDP growth forecast to 1.25 per cent for the year - less severe than the deep recessions of 1981-82 and 2008-09, but worse than the mild recessions of 1991 and 2001,\" noted Goldman Sachs’ economics research team.\n\"Consistent with this, our economists now expect recessions in Europe, Japan, Canada and possibly the United States.\"\nThe US economy was almost certain to enter a recession this year, if it is not in one already, according to a poll published on Thursday and taken after the Federal Reserve’s emergency move on Sunday.\n\"The US economy is going to have a shock from this coronavirus and I think that there’s still a lot of uncertainty around the size and the depth and the prolonged period of the shock,\" said Tiffany Wilding, North American economist at Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO).\n\"We’re still getting our heads wrapped around that. We think it’s quite likely that the US has a small technical recession this year.\"\nAs for the world’s second largest economy, China, where the virus outbreak originated, a Reuters poll published on March 6 showed the outlook was once again cut significantly for this quarter, next quarter, and for 2020.\nSince then, economists have been slashing their forecasts even more.\nThe economic damage from the outbreak was predicted to reverberate through other major economies in Asia too, with most forecast to slow significantly, halt or shrink outright in the current quarter according to a February 26 Reuters poll.\nJapan’s economy, which already contracted sharply toward the end of 2019, was expected to grow only 0.1 per cent in the new fiscal year that begins in April, a March 6 Reuters survey found, revised down from 0.5 per cent projected in February.\nFollowing the rapid spread of virus infections from China to other countries, including Europe, the risk of a euro zone recession doubled in a poll taken earlier this month.\nIt was not very different for the UK, where the Bank of England cut rates to near-zero on Thursday and re-started its asset purchases.\nThe British economy was expected to expand 0.1 per cent this quarter and then contract 0.3% next quarter, a sharp revision from the 0.3 per cent expansion they had expected before for both the quarters in the previous poll.\nIn a worst case scenario, the economy was forecast to contract 1.0 per cent next quarter and by 0.7% in 2020. Forecasts were as low as -5.0 per cent and -3.0 per cent, respectively, with no economist expecting growth in either period in the worst case.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Two major global ratings agencies have downgraded India's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth rate for 2020 in two days. Both have attributed the cut in India's economic growth forecast to the spread of novel coronavirus. And, India is the only country likely to pay a heavy economic cost of novel coronavirus pandemic.\nMoody's on Tuesday marginally cut down India's GDP growth rate for 2020 from its February projection of 5.4 per cent to 5.3 per cent. Moody's had already slashed the growth forecast from 6.6 per cent to 5.4 in February.\nOn the other hand, S&P Global Ratings lowered India's growth forecast of India from 5.7 per cent to 5.2 per cent for 2020. The agency said not just India but the whole world could be in a deep recession under the impact of novel coronavirus pandemic.\nThe problem is bigger for India particularly as the novel coronavirus pandemic hit the world when it was already in a prolonged phase of economic slowdown. The country had just registered a seven-year low GDP growth rate of 4.7 per cent in September-December 2019 quarter when novel coronavirus hit world's economy beginning from the global manufacturing and supply hub of China.\nNovel coronavirus pandemic is already causing shutdowns in sector after sector. The travel and tourism industry is staring down the barrel with little light at the end. This has impacted the hotel industry badly. Even the medical sector, a provider of good amount of employment, has been badly hit in India.\nThough official records will take time to come out, industry estimates in India suggest that the aviation sector has seen up to 75 per cent drop in international bookings and 20 per cent in domestic bookings.\nLayoffs had already begun by February. Major travel agency Expedia laid off 3,000 employees globally to compensate the losses caused by novel coronavirus outbreak then.\nhttps://www.businesstoday.in/buzztop/buzztop-corporate/expedia-to-lay-off-3000-employees-as-coronavirus-hits-travel-industry/story/397040.html\nThe United States has seen sudden spike in layoffs across the country. Reports indicate the sharpest rise in unemployment in the US since the Great Recession of 1929-30. Some 45,000 workers have applied for unemployment benefits in Ohio in the US, more than 15,000 in New Jersey and another 8,000 in Connecticut. This is scary as they all suggest layoffs.\nSimilar reports have come from Spain, Norway, China, South Korea, Italy and a host of other countries. India too is having its share of layoffs. Sporadic reports of layoffs due to novel coronavirus outbreak have been pouring in but there is no consolidated official record of the same. Experts believe that hiring in services sector especially the IT field will be hit by up to 30 per cent due to novel coronavirus outbreak in India.\nIndia has shut down most of its shopping malls and cinema halls in big cities, advised people to stay home as much as possible. Major economic events such as the Indian Premier League have been deferred or curtailed. All these have employment consequences.\nAccording to a report the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) released in the first week of March, the unemployment rate in the shadow of novel coronavirus outbreak in India hit a four-month high of 7.78 per cent.\nGrowth projections for India have been declining in the past eight-nine months. Almost every revision of growth forecast by agencies has downgraded the GDP growth projection.\nAccording to the latest report of SBI Research released on Tuesday, the novel coronavirus-induced lockdowns could bring down India's GDP by almost 1 percentage point (0.9 per cent). This comes on account of a 5 per cent inoperability shock from travel, tourism and hotel industries. The SBI Research paper says the impact could be larger in 2020-21.\nThere is a rush world over to announce economy boosters. The US has announced multi-billion dollar impetus and rate cuts, many countries in Europe have announced tax cuts, the RBI in India did not alter the rates to maintain stability in the wake of novel coronavirus outbreak but it may announce a cut of up to 50 basis points in April to give a fillip to the market.\nStock markets the world over are crashing, wiping out crores of rupees. In India, the Sensex has lost around 10,000 points in less than a month. The accurate impact of the novel coronavirus is still months away from assessment but the contagion looks set to bring in a new global recession.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Over 6,000 people have died globally since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. More than 1,62,000 have been infected by Covid-19. What started in China, soon spread across France, the US, Spain, Italy, South Korea and now India.\nIndia, so far, has officially reported 110 cases and two deaths, according to the Ministry of Health. More cases are emerging every day even as states continue to issue advisories on social distancing.\nThe government has put in place stringent measures to curb the spread of the virus. A mandatory quarantine of 14 days has been initiated for all international travellers arriving in the country.\nFrom thermal screenings at major entry-exit points to sanitisation of public places, the Indian government has put its best foot forward in battling the pandemic which has led to significant panic among Indians.\nSelf-discipline is the best cure\nHowever, more than scrutinising the steps taken by the government, the utmost requirement at the moment is self-discipline.\nWith the threat of the rapidly spreading virus looming large over India due to its billion-plus population, it is important to understand the depravity that could be if the spread is not limited in the initial days.\nItaly is the best example to map how rapidly the virus can spread and why it is absolutely essential to impose self-restrictions at an early stage, and not wait for the disaster to strike.\nThe country recorded 368 more deaths from the coronavirus outbreak on Sunday, its biggest single-day rise, amid growing concern about the ability of its strained health system to cope with the relentless increase in new cases. With 24,747 cases and 1,809 deaths by Sunday - a rise of 368 or 25 per cent in the death toll in just 24 hours - Italy's experience has offered an alarming example for other European countries. And, Indians should take note.\nThe daily rise in cases around the globe, especially in countries like Italy -- with a small population of 60 million people -- is alarming. If the virus spreads with such aggressiveness in India, it could result in severe consequences even after the virus fades away.\nIn Italy, hospitals are also unable to cope with such high-frequency rise on a daily basis. Roberta Re, a nurse at Piacenza hospital in Emilia-Romagna called the situation 'war-like', as reported by The Guardian.\n\"It's an experience I would compare to a world war, but it's a war that isn't fightable with traditional arms - as we don't yet know who the enemy is and so it's difficult to fight. The only weapon we do have to avoid things getting even worse is to stay at home and to respect the rules, to do what they did in China, as this is paying off,\" she said.\nPrecaution, not panic\nWith an abundance of global examples that show the severe spread of Covid-19, it can be deduced that most infections spread through lack of individual restrictions at an initial stage. And as the situation aggravated with rising cases in a country or one particular area, the excessive panic was witnessed.\nThis panic, if substituted by precautions at early stages, could help India avoid the health crisis of a much larger magnitude. However, the government alone would not be able to help limit the virus; all citizens must also act responsibly and take the outbreak seriously.\nSocial media chatter over the past few months since the outbreak has often misled people, as some took it lightly and others panicked to insanity. However, doctors advised none of the above. Instead, they asked people to be prepared with some basic but necessary precautions. Social distancing, however, is the most important one.\nThree ways that you can help\n1) Doctors have asked people to stay home if they absolutely do not have to go out.\n2) Medical experts have also asked people to avoid any kind of large gatherings.\n3) Take care of hygiene, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your face\nThese are a few simple steps you can take to support the government in limiting the spread of Covid-19. While not much is known about this virus, doctors, have asked people to follow these important steps at the moment to delay the spread of the virus. But even if you test positive, there is no need to suppress your travel history or run away.\nThe quarantine process is not only for the recovery of an infected person but it is also for the safety of other people in the country. Going by the rate of spread in Italy, Iran, and China, any person with symptoms coming in contact with other people could prove deadly as the virus would keep multiplying. Even if it does not affect an individual carrying it, doctors have clearly mentioned that its spread could be fatal for older people with a weak immune system.\nFor instance, one of the first cases in Uttar Pradesh's Noida which led to an initial shut down of two schools and a five-star hotel, was from a man who returned from Italy and kept his travel history suppressed. He then kept on with his usual social life, exposing others to the danger.\nThere are many other reports in India about suspected people running away in fear that they would be kept in isolation in the quarantine facility. But people have to realise that the process will help in containing the spread of the virus to a great extent.\nIndia is still in the initial stages with 110 official confirmed cases, and so far, it has managed to keep the death toll much lower than the other countries in the third week of the outbreak. And, by imposing self-restrictions, individuals can help the government in flattening the curve further.\nPeople on social media, especially, the young batch who are yet to grasp the seriousness of the issue, need to be more self vigilant. The basics include - doctor visit for 'flu-like symptoms', avoiding crowded places and social gathering until absolutely necessary, restricting movement, opting for work-from-home. It is important to realise that every country initially had a mere number of cases, but within days it rose massively.\nDesperate times call for desperate measures, and at this hour, more than scrutinising the steps taken by the government, it is imperative to focus on personal hygiene and self-discipline.\n",

Mumbai and most parts of Maharashtra also saw thinner crowds in comparison to other years as well.\nWhile many chose to skip the celebrations altogether, some preferred small gatherings of friends and relatives but without colours. Some, however, played Holi only with 'gulal'.\nEvents like rain dances, Holi parties where large number of people gather were much lesser due to the recent coronavirus developments.

The oil and gas and mining sectors led gains as oil regained its footing after plunging 25% following the breakdown of a crucial global oil pact.

The number of deaths rose by 38 to bring the total toll for mainland China to 2,981 by March 3.\nAll but one new death occurred in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak.\nWith the number of new daily infections overseas now exceeding new cases in China, Chinese officials have begun to seek ways to control the spread of the virus outside of China and guard against future outbreaks.\nAuthorities have asked overseas Chinese hoping to return home to reconsider their travel plans, while cities across the country have set up quarantine rules for those entering from high-risk places.\nAn infected person is known to have arrived in China from Iran, one of the virus' new hotspots, last week.\nChina is encouraging domestic producers of medical protective equipment to export protective suits to meet overseas demand as the virus spreads, Cao Xuejun, an official with China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in a press briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.\nChina's health authorities are also studying setting up emergency reserves for medical resources and protective materials, Mao Qunan, an official at China's National Health Commission said at the same briefing.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "At the end of 2019, a coronavirus has broken through the species barrier, reached humans and is scaring the world. Since it's a new virus infecting humans, there's still a lot to know about it. The scientific community and public health authorities have been working together to get to know the details and as soon as possible. What do we really know about this epidemic with epicenter in the city of Wuhan in the center of China?\nAre there already cases in Portugal of infection with the new coronavirus? Yes, the first two cases of Portuguese with Covid-19 were confirmed this Monday (2nd March). The first case was one of a 60-year-old doctor on holiday in northern Italy. He was admitted to St. Anthony's Hospital in Porto and experienced the first symptoms on 29 in February. The second case was confirmed by a 33-year-old commercial in the construction sector returned from Valencia, Spain. He was admitted to St John's Hospital in Oporto and experienced the first symptoms at 26 in February. This Tuesday, the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) confirmed two more cases: that of a man 60-year-old who is connected to another case already confirmed in Portugal and is at the University Hospital Centre of St John in Oporto; and that of a man 37 years since he was also linked to another case and is at Curry Cabral Hospital in Lisbon.\nWhat's the name of the virus and the disease? The official name of the virus is coronavirus of severe acute 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), as it has genetic similarities to SARS-CoV in about 80%. This designation was assigned by the International Committee for Virus Taxonomy and published this week in an article in the bioRxiv free access repository. Until then, it has been temporarily designated \"2019-nCoV\".\nThe name chosen for the disease caused by the virus was \"Covid-19\", which emerged from the English acronym for the expression \"coronavirus disease 2019\" (coronavirus disease 2019Yeah. The decision was taken by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in collaboration with the World Organisation for Animal Health and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation.\nBoth the name of the virus and the disease were chosen in such a way that there are no references to specific geographical locations, groups of people or animals, so that stigmatisation is avoided.\nIs it known what the origin of the new coronavirus is and how it passed on to humans? No, there are only suspicions. In a recent report, the WHO indicated that there is increasing evidence that there is a link between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses found in bats, especially those of subspecies of the genus Rhinolophus, which are abundant in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. The transmission circuit is also unknown and \"the most likely scenario is that an intermediate host animal played a role in the transmission\". Last week, a team of Chinese scientists concluded that Pangolim is a potential intermediate host of the virus.\nDiscovering the source of the coronavirus may help to understand how the onset of the outbreak took place in Wuhan City and thus prevent future coronavirus outbreaks. There are several teams, including one from the WHO in China, trying to answer these and other questions.\nWhat symptoms does it cause? Dry cough, fever, fatigue and difficulty breathing. Most people have flu-like symptoms and a small proportion of patients will develop pneumonia. In the most serious cases of pneumonia, organ failure may occur and Covid-19 becomes fatal.\nHow is it transmitted? Through direct contact with infected people. This can happen through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, saliva droplets or nose secretions. Therefore, the WHO recommends having a \"good respiratory hygiene practice\", such as sneezing at the elboYeah. It is also important that people wash their hands regularly when they are in contact with people with the symptoms of Covid-19.\nAlthough the origin may have been an animal, there is no evidence to indicate that a domestic animal can transmit this coronavirus. Even so, the WHO states that food should be cooked with care to avoid cross contamination or to pay attention to contact with live animals or areas on live animal markets.\nAs to whether it is safe to receive an order from China, one of the most frequently asked questions, the WHO undoubtedly answers: \"It is safe. People are not in danger of contracting the new coronavirus if they receive orders. From the experience we have of other coronaviruses, this type of virus does not survive long in objects such as letters and packages.\"\nCan asymptomatic people really transmit this coronavirus? Yes, it may be possible that people infected with the virus may be infectious before showing significant symptoms, refers to WHO, which cites recent reports. Even so, according to the available data, people who have symptoms are causing most of the cases. It takes more clinical information to determine what the infectious period is.\nAnd what is the incubation period? For now, it is estimated that it can go from one to 12,5 days and that the average is between five to six days. The WHO states that these estimates should still be improved, but on the basis of information on other coronavirus diseases, the incubation period should be four days.\nIn February, a team of Chinese scientists announced that the average incubation period would be only three days and that this period could extend to 24 days. These preliminary results were briefly reported at the MedRxiv Health Science Research portaYeah. At a press conference, the Director General for Portuguese Health, Grace Freitas, did not value the study, saying it is information \"that is not validated\", \"one of the many studies that are circulating\" and that the WHO does not even mention it.\nHow dangerous can this virus be? Based on the available data, the mortality rate is about three%. However, this number may be overestimated because it only takes into account confirmed cases and there may be even more infected people, according to information made available by the UK Science Media Centre.\nHave we reached the peak of the epidemic? We don't know yet. February 12th, the WHO announced that the number of new cases of coronavirus had stabilised the previous week. However, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO, warred that care was needed for interpretations made from there: \"This outbreak could still go in any direction.\" On the very next day more than 13 thousand new cases were recorded in a single day in the Hubei region, where Wuhan is. The WHO points out that this was due to a change in the way cases were diagnosed. \"We have seen a significant spike in the number of cases reported in China, but there is no significant change in the course of the Covid-19 outbreak,\" said Mike Ryan, Director of the WHO Emergency Programme at a press conference later this week. He also pointed out that Covid-19 cases are not rising dramatically outside China. The exception was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which confirmed more 44 cases. All along, that ship quarantined in Japan already had over 200 confirmed cases.\nIn an interview with Reuters, epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan (researcher of the Chinese National Health Commission) was optimistic and stated that the peak of the outbreak could be reached in mid-or late April. But it's too early for prognosisYeah.\nWho could be more vulnerable to the virus? It has yet to be better understood how this coronavirus affects people, but older people and people with pre-existing diseases appear to be at greater risk of seriously developing Covid-19.\nHow many infected people have recovered worldwide? According to data from the real-time Worldometer statistics website of 80.026 confirmed cases in mainland China, 44.462 (56%) managed to recover from the disease. According to Johns Hopkins University (USA), the recovery rate in China exceeds the 50%barrier.\nHow long does the virus survive on the surfaces? It is not well known either, but WHO refers to preliminary information suggesting that it may survive \"a few hours or more\". Simple disinfectants may be enough for the virus not to last long enough to infect people.\nIs there a specific treatment? No, there is still no specific medicine or treatment recommended to prevent or treat Covid-19. Infected people receive health care to alleviate or treat their symptoms. In the most serious cases, they receive organ support therapy. Because it's a virus, the WHO warns that antibiotics won't kill it.\nApproximately 300 experts meeting in Geneva (Switzerland) in February at a meeting organised by the WHO set out different priorities: the treatment of people already infected with Covid-19; finding easy ways to test; and understanding the behaviour of the virus.\nDetails of the treatments for the virus were also given. Quoted by New Scientist magazine, WHO noted that results of clinical trials to determine whether HIV medicines (lopinavir and ritonavir) are effective for treating Covid-19 symptoms \"will be known in a few days or weeksYeah. Clinical trials for remdesivir (which was initially developed for Ebola virus) are also expected to be ready in \"a few weeks\". Four Covid-19 vaccines are also being developed at the moment. The WHO estimated that in three or four months'time, people would start testing for one or two of these vaccines and that one would be available for general use in 18 months' time.\nWhat are the recommendations for people to protect themselves? These are the basic recommendations used to reduce any risk of acute respiratory infection and are mainly for travellers, such as: avoiding close contact with people with these infections; frequently washing their hands, especially after being in direct contact with sick people; avoid unprotected contact with wild animals or for human consumption; or adopt respiratory label measures.\nIf you have been in an area where Covid-19 has existed or still exists, you should follow the recommendations of the WHO and the national and local health authorities. If you have not been in an area where you have Covid-19 and have not been with infected people, your risk of infection is low, refers to the WHO in a recent report. \"It is understandable that you may be anxious about this epidemic. But check the facts from credible sources to help you determine the risks accurately and be able to take reasonable precautions,\"he also recommends to the WHO. The Health Directorate has created a website dedicated to the new coronavirus.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nIf you have symptoms, what should you do? In general, the Directorate-General for Health recommends that people coming from an affected area where they may have had contact with patients should actively monitor and contact the SNS 24 (808 24 24) line to get advice on what to do. \"It will be a case-by-case worYeah. And other measures may be defined from the counselling,\"said Grace Freitas, Director General of Health, at a press conference.\nWhich Portuguese hospitals may receive infected patients? In the north of the country, they are able to receive patients with the new coronavirus hospitals of San Juan and San Antonio, both in Oporto, as well as the Braga Hospital, the Local Health Unit (ULS) of Matosinhos and the Tamega and Sousa Hospitality Centre. At the center, the response is reinforced at the Guard ULS and the Coimbra Children's Hospital. In the region of Lisbon and Vale do Tejo, are the University of Lisbon Centre for Hospitality Northern (Santa Maria Hospital and Pulido Valente Hospital) and the Western Lisbon University Hospital for Hospitality (Egas Moniz Hospital and San Francisco Xavier Hospital). In Alentejo, she is ready to admit patients with the new coronavirus to Litoral ULS Alentejano. In the Algarve, the answer is provided through the Algarve University Hospitality Centre.\nIs this a pandemic already? No. The WHO considers that coronavirus is not yet a pandemic, a term used to describe situations in which an infectious disease threatens many people simultaneously and around the world. \"We are in an epidemic phase with multiple outbreaks,\" said Sylvie Briand, director of the global preparedness department for WHO infectious risks. At the moment, over a 90 thousand people are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have died from more than three thousand people around the world, according to the data from the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). Italy is the country of Europe with the most recorded cases, going beyond the 1600s.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Postponed premieres, hundreds of closed theaters all over the world, almost ghost rooms, cancelled footage. The impact of SARS-CoV-2, commonly known as the new coronavirus, on the film industry is leading to immediate shortages in box office results and estimates of losses that may rise to the four,5 billion euro worldwide, but above all with the focus on Asia.\nThe accounts are of analysts quoted by the Hollywood Reporter magazine, who estimate that losses may rise or even exceed, and that the largest world exhibition market, the US, is also the victim of a drop in turnout, the 4,5 billion euro. The main damage is mainly related to the screening of cinema in the countries most affected by the coronavirus, and which in some cases are even the most important markets in the world. There is no time limit for regularising the situation with regard to decisions by companies and authorities, nor for the confidence of some spectators to return.\nThe countries most affected by the sharp decrease in the number of spectators are China (the world's second largest market), South Korea (the world's fifth largest market), Italy or Japan (the world's third largest market). In addition, in the world of entertainment, there are postponed concert tours of musicians to Asian portions or promotional or press events that take place in Skype sessions or web conferences, the closing of cinemas, The escape of spectators and the cancellation of premieres in important Chinese or South Korean markets are having a direct impact on cinema.\nIn China there are 70 thousand closed cinemas and no re-opening forecast for the coming monthYeah. A gigantic drop in box office results is palpable in the numbers: Variety magazine cites data from the film market analyst Comscore that show how in the first two months of 2020 the Chinese box office made only 214 million euros (gross results) against the 1,8 billion euros it had embedded in 2019. Only in the last month, that of the Chinese New Year and the one in which the Covid-19 outbreak became known, the revenue went from 1,5 billion euros in 2019 to mere 4,2 million euros this year.\nIn South Korea the loss is 70% compared to last year. \"Cinemas are open, but they might as well not be,\" says a distributor anonymously to the Hollywood Reporter. \"The situation is much worse than what we saw during the MERS outbreak in 2015 [the Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS-CoV]. At the time there was a public outage of over 40% but there were no closed cinemas and the market was revived after a month\", says the responsible South Korean Film Commission official. Viewers tend to avoid rooms at a time when there are more than 4800 cases in the country, where for example the premiere of a black-and-white version of Parasites, the South Korean film that historically snatched the Oscars this year, has been postponed.\nIn Japan (980 cases confirmed this Tuesday), there is estimated to be a 10 to 15% drop in the box office. Already in Italy, the biggest European focus of the new disease, only last weekend did the influx to Italian theaters fall 75% in relation to the same weekend as 2019, for example. This week, in Italy there are about 850 screens not working, the total in the country is 1830, recalls Variety. The premieres of some American films were postponeYeah.\nAlso in China, American film premieres for the next few weeks and months are suspended: Mulan premieres, 007: No Time to Die, Dolittle, 191, Jojo Rabbit, Sonic the Movie have been postponed; in South Korea, the debut of Bora A, Pixar, is also dated. The postponement of simultaneous global premieres, notably by failing the important Chinese market, increases the risk of piracy and additional loss of revenue.\nLooking to the future is a tough thing to do right now. In the Chinese capital, for example, we must comply with the directives of the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the Municipal Cinema Office, which, since 26 in February, have forced the authorities to approve in advance the start of cinemas. To reopen, tickets must only be sold in alternating queues and only to spectators who identify themselves. Each room must be thoroughly disinfected immediately after one session and before the next.\nAs for filming, Variety recalls, if the teams are less than fifty people, they are almost automatically allowed to film in Beijing as long as the body temperature of the workers does not exceed the 37 degrees centigrade and everyone (except actors) wears masks. The larger teams are even forbidden to work. \"Looking at the current situation, the film industry is not equipped to resume work\", admits Chen Bei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Beijing municipal government. Among the outstanding films is Jia Zhang-ke's next project, as the director told the IndieWire website, whose shooting is postponed sine die.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nIn this field, and among the first professional victims of the coronavirus impact are the filming of the next Mission: Impossible in Venice, suspended until further notice.\nIndustry also resents the purely negotiating sideYeah. The presence of Chinese buyers on audiovisual markets such as MIPTV this spring, as with the low accession of Chinese distributors at the last Berlin Film Festival, should be sparse and important distribution agreements may therefore be lost. With cancellations or postponements of events and fairs around the world, from the Bologna Children's Book Fair to the Paris Book Hall, the Hollywood Reporter indicates that the Cannes Festival is still on the table and that preparations for the biggest international film event continue, while paying attention to \"developments and directives of authorities\"",

The German, 33-year-old, will have become infected after having had a meeting with a Chinese colleague visiting the country, explained to the Bavarian authorities where the citizen is hospitalized, quoted by the El Pais. According to the AFP, the examinations confirmed the infection this Monday evening.\nThe Chinese woman who infected the German patient is from Shanghai and will have \"started to feel bad on the flight home, 23 in January\", said Andreas Zapf, from the Bavarian health department.\nThere have also been two other cases of human contagion outside China: one in Vietnam and one in Japan, with the Japanese authorities confirming the first case of contagion in the country this Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, China moved to 106 this Tuesday the number of deaths caused by the coronavirus detected in Wuhan. The number of new cases has also increased to 1300 and the latest balance sheet indicates the existence of infected 4000.\nThe latest data led Hong Kong to adopt a new strategy to try to prevent the spread of the disease. Carrie Lam, the head of the local executive, announced on Monday night the suspension of boat and train connections and the reduction to half flights to and from mainland China. The issue of authorisations for entry into the territory from China is also suspended.\n\"The flow of people between the two locations has to be drastically reduced,\" said Carrie Lam, quoted by the South China Morning Post.\nAs cases increase, several countries are trying to find a way to get nationals out of China, and Portugal is one of them.\nIn Hubei province, where the epidemic began, the new coronavirus has killed more 24 people and infected 1291Yeah. No deaths have yet been reported outside Hubei Province and the Chinese authorities are concentrating efforts in that province, sending almost 6000 doctors to the area. A total of 4130 doctors, integrated into thirty teams, have already arrived and started work, said Jiao Yahui, a head of the National Health Commission, During a press conference in Beijing, adding that 1800 more will arrive by the end of this Tuesday. The first teams were dispatched from Shanghai City and Guangdong Province on Friday.\nThe latest estimate indicates that more than fort00 are already confirmed infected in China. In addition to mainland China, cases of infection have also been reported in Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Singapore, Vietnam, Nepal, Malaysia, France, Germany, Australia and Canada.\nThe Wuhan region is under quarantine, which affects 56 million people. The quarantine, determined by the Chinese Government as a measure to prevent the transmission of this new coronavirus, cancelled most of Wuhan's long-haul air and ground transport out.\nThis Tuesday, the Japanese Government reported that it will be sending a charter flight to Wuhan to withdraw 200 from the 650 Japanese citizens in what was the epicentre city of the epidemic. \"The Chinese side has informed us that it is now ready to accept a charter flight. The first flight to Wuhan Airport will leave tonight and we will also bring another kind of help,\"said Toshimitsu Motegi to journalists, quoted by Lusa agency.\nThe United States follows in its footsteps, with a flight planned for Thursday night, although there is some doubt whether the schedule will be met, writes The Guardian. South Korea and France also want to remove their citizens from Chinese territory this week, but are studying possibilities with the Chinese authoritieYeah.\nThe same is true of Portugal: the Portuguese Government wants to withdraw the around-20 nationals stranded in Wuhan by air, using a chartered civilian aircraft that takes these Portuguese \"directly to Portugal\". The possibility of carrying out the operation together with other European Union countries within the European solidarity mechanism foreseen for this type of situation is considered.\nIn the Philippines, on the other hand, we opted to suspend visas to and from China, a \"temporary\" measure, which aims to reduce the influx of group travel from China, which is the second largest tourist market for the Philippines. Other countries, such as the US or the United Kingdom, are asking their citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to China.\nThe Portuguese Government strengthens this advice: \"In the present circumstances, it is advisable at this time, and until the current situation is reviewed by the Chinese authorities, non-essential travel to China, not only for possible health risks but also for the present limitations on movement within the country\", reads the Community Portal.\nThe Director General of Health said on Monday that the Portuguese living in Wuhan, the Chinese city of origin of the new coronavirus, \"are healthy\". \"Initially, as far as we know, they [the Portuguese citizens living in Wuhan, China] are not symptomatic, nor are they sick. They are healthy and they are well. They will come [to Portugal] like any other asymptomatic passenger,\"he said to the agency Lusa Grace Freitas.\nGrace Freitas explained that, \"how they come from the epicentre of the disease\", on arrival in Portugal a \"small medical history will be made to understand if they have been in contact with patients\" infected with the new coronavirus or if they have been in contact with animalIf these citizens don't show symptoms, we know where they're going, we stay in touch with them, we contact the health authorities in the area of residence so that if they develop symptomatology in the next few days they can contact that health authority, the Director-General for Health (DGS) continued.\nIf any of these Portuguese develop symptoms, they should contact the health authorities recommended by the DGS, indicate if they have had contact with other people outside the residence, with patients or animals and \"some social isolation precaution\" may also be requested.\nGrace Freitas further explained that there will be completely different health protocols if \"they are already sick there [in Wuhan]\" or if they show symptoms on board the plane. \"They can board there without signs, symptoms and develop the signs and symptoms on board. There is also a protocol to this,\"he said, clarifying that this will involve the commander of the aircraft alerting health authorities on the ground and those patients being removed.\nThe virus, nicknamed by the WHO as 2019-nCoV, is a form of coronavirus that has not yet been observed in humans. The most common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing difficulties. In more serious cases infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, renal failure or to death, according to WHO.\nThe coronavirus is \"transmitted between animals and humans\". \"Detailed investigations have shown that SARS-CoV was transmitted between cats-civeta and humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans\", explains the WHO.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nComparisons with severe acute respiratory syndrome (better known as SARS) are almost inevitable and com e out strengthened after the genome analysis of this new coronavirus, which has been shown to be more similar to SARS than any other coronaviruYeah. The last SARS outbreak started in South China and more than eight thousand cases were reported worldwide. About 800 people died between 2002 and 2003. Since 2004, no new case has been reported worldwide and the medical community has considered SARS eradicated. SARS symptoms are common to other viral respiratory infections: fever, chills, muscle pain, cough and difficulty breathing.\nThe Chinese authorities have admitted that the ability to spread the virus has increased. Infected persons may transmit the disease during the incubation period, which takes between one day and two weeks, without the virus being detected. The wearing of masks is now compulsory in most cities, writes the BBC. There's still no treatment or vaccine.\nThe government decided to extend the Lunar New Year's holiday period, which was due to end on Thursday, to try to limit population movements",

After all, the 38-year-old did bring his Sanctuary World Tour to 26 cities in China last year, which puts him among the top three three artistes, along with Jonathan Lee and Li Ronghao, to have toured the most Chinese cities. And it's because of this that his absence on the “most tickets sold” list has become even more glaring to his fans. \n And boy are they incensed. Not only did they doubt the authenticity of the report, they also took to Jay’s Weibo fan page to air their grievances. \n However, what JJ’s fans did not realise was that the list was an accumulation of all box office sales for the past three years.You see, JJ’s Sanctuary World Tour started in 2018 and lasted all through 2019. On the other hand, Jay’s Invincible World Tour was held from 2016 to 2018, while his Carnival World Tour started in 2019 and would still be going on if not for the COVID-19 pandemic.

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON — The United States now has more Covid-19 infections than any other country, and a record number of newly unemployed people, as the coronavirus crisis deepens around the world. \n Hours after his nation reached the grim milestone, US President Donald Trump spoke by phone to China's Xi Jinping, after weeks of bickering and finger pointing over a disease researchers say could kill at least 1.8 million people by the end of the year. \n \"Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China,\" Mr Trump tweeted. \n \"China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!\" \n The warm words — which were not quite echoed in the Chinese state media readout of the call — came after a few weeks in which the White House had repeatedly referred to \"the Chinese coronavirus\", angering Beijing. \n China, which appears to have got on top of its own outbreak, readied to bar entry to foreigners as it frets over a surge in imported cases, illustrating the difficulty of containing a virus in an interconnected world. \n Wuhan, the city where the illness first emerged late last year, was — from midnight — to ease severe movement restrictions in place for two months. \n That initial lockdown has now been aped around the world, with three billion people told to stay indoors. \n Healthcare systems in even the most developed nations are being stretched to breaking point with dire warnings they could soon be overwhelmed. \n More than 530,000 people globally have been sickened by the disease. \n A tally by Johns Hopkins University showed that by around 5pm SGT Friday (March 27), there were almost 86,000 known infections in the US. That figure is higher than both China and hard-hit Italy, which accounts for a third of the 24,000 deaths worldwide. \n GRIM PREDICTIONS \n Even with lockdowns implemented around the world, researchers at Imperial College London said Thursday the global death toll could be staggering. \n Their model shows 1.86 million people could die, with nearly 470 million infected this year.  \n Failure to act swiftly in imposing lockdowns and strict social distancing could make those numbers far higher, they warned. \n \"Our analysis highlights the challenging decisions faced by all governments in the coming weeks and months, but demonstrates the extent to which rapid, decisive and collective action now could save millions of lives,\" the researchers said. \n As fears mount over a global recession that could even dwarf the Great Depression of the 1930s, leaders from the Group of 20 major economies held crisis talks by video link on Thursday. \n They pledged a \"united front\" to fight the outbreak — along with an enormous financial rescue package. \n \"The virus respects no borders,\" the leaders said in a statement. \n \"We are injecting over US$5 trillion (S$7.17 trillion) into the global economy, as part of targeted fiscal policy, economic measures, and guarantee schemes to counteract the social, economic and financial impacts of the pandemic.\" \n They also pledged \"robust\" support for developing nations, where experts fear the coronavirus could wreak havoc. \n PAINFUL CHOICES \n Medical systems in even the most developed nations are straining under the weight of new patients. \n In New York, where tens of thousands are ill, Governor Andrew Cuomo warned there were simply not enough hospital beds. \n \"Almost any scenario that is realistic will overwhelm the capacity of the current healthcare system,\" he said. \n For those fighting on the frontlines, the pressure was showing. \n \"To watch somebody in their thirties die, it's hard,\" said one respiratory therapist in the city who requested anonymity. \"You can't have visitors.

        "news_content_translate_en": "BUENOS AIRES - As Argentina was scrambling to introduce emergency measures to insulate its ailing economy from the coronavirus last week, the Chinese ambassador paid a visit to the home of President Alberto Fernandez to discuss an offer.  \n At the meeting in the wealthy Olivos suburb of Buenos Aires, ambassador Zou Xiaoli laid out how the Asian giant was ready to help Argentina face the pandemic: donating masks, gloves, thermometers and protective suits.  \n The donations, welcomed by Fernandez's government, show how China is leveraging its production of medical equipment and expertise in halting the coronavirus as a soft-power tool in regions like South America, where it is jostling for influence against the United States.  \n From Argentina to Mexico, Brazil to Peru, Latin American nations have accepted offers of support from China as the number of coronavirus cases across the region has climbed, amid growing fears about the preparedness of their healthcare systems.  \n There have been nearly 500,000 confirmed cases worldwide of the virus, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, and over 20,000 deaths.  \n Although South America has so far not been as hard hit as other parts of the world, experts fear that may change as winter arrives in the southern hemisphere.  \n \"Some countries in the region have reached out to China asking for help,\" a Chinese official in Buenos Aires, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. \"We will share with them our experience in combating COVID-19 and offer sanitary materials within our capacity.\"  \n As trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have simmered in recent years, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has warned Latin American nations that they should be wary of becoming too economically reliant on China - to little avail.  \n In Argentina, the region's third-largest economy, China has made steady in-roads, from solar power investments to the construction of a new space monitoring station. It has supplied over $17 billion of financing since 2007, Inter-American Dialogue data shows. China has also become the top consumer of Argentine soybeans and beef.  \n As the coronavirus spread in China, Argentina's new left-leaning leader Fernandez - who took office in December - exchanged correspondence with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.  \n In letters seen by Reuters, Fernandez offered solidarity to China in February as the virus raged from the outbreak center of Wuhan. In March, Xi replied that the situation in China was improving and he called for a deepening of ties between the two nations.  \n Days later, the Chinese embassy announced its donations, posting pictures on Twitter of large trucks carrying a mobile hospital that was set up within a military base near the Argentine capital.  \n \"China will continue to help in all possible channels. Long live friendship!\" the embassy said on Twitter.  \n The help came at a difficult time for Argentina, which is grappling with a severe economic crisis and re-negotiating $110 billion in foreign debt with creditors, including the International Monetary Fund.  \n \"This is part of the link we have with China, which is a solid relationship of mutual respect and ties that go beyond strong trade,\" a spokesman for Argentina's foreign ministry told Reuters, when asked about the donations.  \n  \n INFORMATION CONTROL  \n China's aid to Latin America reflects a broader global trend, as Beijing looks to steer the narrative away from it being the country where the coronavirus started and was initially downplayed. Instead, China wants to be seen as spearheading the global fight against the pandemic, experts say.  \n Luo Zhaohui, a vice minister at China's foreign ministry, said at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday that the country would \"ride out the storm with people from other countries, strengthen cooperation and strive to win the last victory in the fight against the virus.\"  \n While Trump has been criticized by opponents for branding the pandemic 'the Chinese virus,' China has won praise among Latin American governments that have accepted its help. The Chinese government said it has supplied test kits, protective suits and other forms of medical aid to more than 80 countries and international organizations.  \n \"It's remarkable and a credit, in a way, to China's own commanding control of information that it's been able to re-envision itself as a leader in the fight against coronavirus globally,\" said Margaret Myers, director of the China and Latin American program at the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue.  \n Myers said the recent re-start of Chinese industry, as cases have subsided, has enabled the country to be a provider of key products as the rest of the world's production slows.  \n \"This will create opportunities for China in the coming years,\" she said.  \n The United States, meanwhile, is struggling with its own battle to contain the virus, with the World Health Organization warning on Tuesday that the country could become a new epicenter of the crisis.  \n Before the epidemic hit hardest, Washington in February pledged $100 million towards international efforts in combating COVID-19, including for developing nations. A regional breakdown of that funding was not immediately available.  \n  \n THANK YOU, CHINA  \n In Latin America, China's hands-on approach has been well received.  \n Chile, which has among the highest numbers of coronavirus cases in the region, has sought advice from Chinese health officials to guide its response and is sending an air force plane to China to pick up donated supplies, including tests and respiratory equipment, Chile's health minister said.  \n In Mexico, officials have said they are awaiting 300 ventilators from China, crucial yet scarce equipment in treating patients, while in Panama, government health officials heralded a video conference with Chinese experts to work on strategy, something China has done with more than 100 countries.  \n In Venezuela, the government of President Nicolas Maduro said China would send protective gear for health professionals and coronavirus test kits. The country has also opened talks with China over possible financial support.  \n \"Thank you China for cooperation and solidarity with Ecuador!\" the country's Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner wrote on Twitter, itemizing help from China that he said included 40,000 surgical masks, infrared thermometers, and protective suits.  \n In Brazil, right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has moved quickly to heal a diplomatic rift with China and Chinese officials have said Beijing would assist with medical supplies and technical assistance.  \n Chinese firms, including Alibaba, Huawei, COFCO, China Communications Construction and the Bank of China have pledged donations around the region.  \n Back in Argentina, Washington is keen to show that it also wants to help.  \n \"We plan this week to make funds available to Argentine authorities to combat coronavirus,\" an official at the U.S. embassy in Buenos Aires told Reuters, adding the country was \"looking at the possibility of additional donations.\" REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "MADRID — More than three billion people around the world were living under lockdown on Wednesday (March 26) as governments stepped up their efforts against the coronavirus pandemic which has left more than 20,000 people dead. \n As the number of confirmed cases worldwide soared past 450,000, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that only a concerted global effort could stop the spread of the virus. \n In Spain, the number of fatalities surpassed those of China, where the novel coronavirus first emerged three months ago, making it the hardest-hit nation after Italy. \n A total of more than 20,800 deaths have now been reported in 182 countries and territories, according to an AFP tally. \n Stock markets rebounded after the US Congress moved closer to passing a US$2.2 trillion relief package to prop up a teetering US economy. \n In Washington, US President Donald Trump said New York, the epicenter of the US outbreak with over 30,000 cases, likely has a few \"tough weeks\" ahead but he would decide soon whether unaffected parts of the country can get back to work. \n \"We want to get our country going again,\" Mr Trump said. \"I'm not going to do anything rash or hastily. \n \"By Easter we'll have a recommendation and maybe before Easter,\" said Mr Trump, who had been touting a strong US economy as he faces an election in November. \n UN chief Guterres said the world needs to ban together to stem the pandemic. \n \"Covid-19 is threatening the whole of humanity — and the whole of humanity must fight back,\" Mr Guterres said, launching an appeal for US$2 billion to help the world's poor. \n \"Global action and solidarity are crucial,\" he said. \"Individual country responses are not going to be enough.\" \n TWO DEATHS IN RUSSIA \n India's stay-at-home order for its 1.3 billion people is now the biggest, taking the total number of individuals facing restrictions on their daily lives to more than three billion. \n Anxious Indians raced for supplies after the world's second-biggest population was ordered not to leave their houses for three weeks. \n Russia, which announced the death of two patients who tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday, is expected to follow suit. \n Russian President Vladimir Putin declared next week a public holiday and postponed a public vote on controversial constitutional reforms, urging people to follow instructions given by authorities. \n In Britain, heir to the throne Prince Charles became the latest high-profile figure to be infected, though he has suffered only mild symptoms. \n The G20 major economies will hold an emergency videoconference on Thursday to discuss a global response to the crisis, as will the 27 leaders of the European Union, the outbreak's new epicenter. \n China has begun to relax its own draconian restrictions on free movement in the province of Hubei — where the outbreak began in December — after the country reported no new cases. \n Crowds jammed trains and buses in the province as people took their first opportunity to travel. \n But Spain saw the number of deaths surge to more than 3,400 after 738 people died in the past 24 hours and the government announced a 432 million euro (S$682 million) deal to buy medical supplies from Beijing. \n The death toll in Italy jumped in 24 hours by 683 to 7,503 — by far the highest of any country. \n The number of French deaths was up by 231 on Wednesday to more than 1,330, and metro and rail services in Paris were cut to a minimum. \n Spain and Italy were joined by France and six more EU countries in urging Germany and the Netherlands to allow the issue of joint European bonds to cut borrowing costs and stabilise the eurozone economy. \n The call is likely to fall on deaf ears when EU leaders talk on Thursday — with northern members wary of pooling debt with big spenders — but they will sign off on an \"unprecedented\" recovery plan. \n 'PEOPLE DYING ALONE' \n At La Paz University Hospital in Madrid, nurse Guillen del Barrio sounded bereft as he related what happened overnight. \n \"It is really hard, we had feverish people for many hours in the waiting room,\" the 30-year-old told AFP. \n \"Many of my colleagues were crying because there were people who are dying alone, without seeing their family for the last time.\" \n Coronavirus cases are also spreading in the Middle East, where Iran's death toll topped 2,000, and in Africa, where Mali declared its first case and several nations announced states of emergency. \n In Japan, which has postponed this year's Olympic Games, Tokyo's governor urged residents to stay home this weekend, warning of a possible \"explosion\" of the coronavirus. \n Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre, believed by Christians to house Christ's tomb, was shut as Israel tightened movement restrictions. \n The impact of the pandemic is also hitting European football, with leagues and tournaments cancelled, while the fate of the Wimbledon tennis tournament could be decided next week. \n The economic damage of the virus — and the lockdowns — could also be devastating, with fears of a worldwide recession worse than the financial meltdown more than a decade ago. \n But financial markets rose after US leaders reached agreement on a stimulus package worth roughly 10 percent of the US economy, an injection Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said represented a \"wartime level of investment.\" \n Meanwhile, more than half of all Americans have been told to stay at home, including residents of the largest state, California. \n The United States has at least 65,700 cases and 942 people have died.

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW DELHI/MUMBAI - India ordered a 21-day lockdown of its 1.3 billion people on Tuesday to try to protect the world's second most populous country from the coronavirus spreading around the world.  \n Health researchers have warned that more than a million people in India could be infected with the coronavirus by mid-May, prompting the government to shut down all air and train travel, businesses and schools.  \n On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the powerful leader of the world's biggest democracy went further, saying nobody in the world's biggest democracy will be allowed to leave their homes for the next three weeks from midnight on Tuesday.  \n \"The only way to save ourselves from coronavirus is if we don’t leave our homes, whatever happens, we stay at home,\" Modi said in a second address in less than a week to try and rally around Indians behind the sweeping lockdown.  \n \"Every district, every lane, every village will be under lockdown,\" he said, warning the country would be set back by decades if it didn't shut down and fight the virus.  \n Scores of people turned up at shops in Delhi and Mumbai and elsewhere to buy essentials before the ban orders went into effect.  \n India has found 482 cases of the coronavirus and 10 people have died from the COVID-19 disease it causes but alarm is growing across the region about prospects for its spread into impoverished communities and the ability of resource-starved public health sectors to cope.  \n  \n VIRUS ENTERING SMALL TOWNS  \n Already health officials said the virus was spreading out of big Indian cities where it first appeared into the small towns that dot the landscape.  \n More than 377,300 people have been infected by the coronavirus globally and 16,520 have died since it emerged in China, according to a Reuters tally.  \n China's Wuhan where the virus emerged imposed a two-month lockdown which is only being eased now.  \n Modi acted just a day after the WHO called for aggressive action by India, saying it was critical to the global fight against the disease.  \n India's population is even more densely packed than China's.  \n \"... The future of this pandemic to a greater extent will be determined by what happens with very large, densely populated countries,\" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's emergencies programme, said.  \n \"So it's really, really important that India continues to take aggressive action at the public health level and at the level of society to contain, control and suppress this disease.\"  \n The Indian government said essential services including groceries, fuel stations and banks will remain open. The stock market, located in the financial capital Mumbai, will also operate on Wednesday.  \n  \n PANIC BUYING  \n But ahead of the shutdown starting midnight, people in Delhi and Mumbai were rushing to shops to stock up essentials and in some areas police were deployed to main order.  \n Modi said the government was working to reduce the difficulties for the poor who will be the hardest hit by the shuttering down of Asia's third largest economy. But he did not provide any details.  \n He urged people not to crowd around shops and said there was enough stocks.  \n \"It is a decisive decision - a difficult one, but probably the right one,\" said Partha Chatterjee, professor of economics at Shiv Nadar University near New Delhi.  \n \"The first priority is to save lives and then think of reconstruction.\"  \n Across South Asia, home to a quarter of the world's population, authorities are scrambling to raise their defences as the virus spreads.  \n Four NATO service members in Afghanistan tested positive for coronavirus shortly after entering the country, the first confirmed cases in the mission, NATO said in a statement.  \n \"The service members were newly arrived in country, and were in a precautionary screening facility when they became symptomatic, were moved to isolation and were tested,\" the statement said.  \n Around 1,500 NATO service members, most of whom had recently arrived in Afghanistan, were in screening facilities as a precautionary measure, NATO said.  \n Afghanistan's health ministry said that WHO had estimated that 80 percent of the war ravaged country's 32 million population could be infected with the virus in the next five months. So far it has had 74 cases and one death.  \n Invoking a 56-year-old law, Nepal also ordered a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the virus after reporting a second case in the Himalayan nation of 30 million people.

        "news_content_translate_en": "HONG KONG — The number of \"silent carriers\" — people who are infected by the new coronavirus but show delayed or no symptoms — could be as high as one-third of those who test positive, according to classified Chinese government data seen by the South China Morning Post. \n That could further complicate the strategies being used by countries to contain the virus, which has infected more than 280,000 people and killed nearly 13,000 globally. \n More than 43,000 people in China had tested positive for Covid-19 by the end of February but had no immediate symptoms, a condition typically known as asymptomatic, according to the data. They were placed in quarantine and monitored but were not included in the official tally of confirmed cases, which stood at about 80,000 at the time. \n Scientists have been unable to agree on what role asymptomatic transmission plays in spreading the disease. A patient usually develops symptoms in five days, though the incubation period can be as long as three weeks in some rare cases. \n One obstacle is that countries tally their confirmed cases differently. \n The World Health Organisation classifies all people who test positive as confirmed cases regardless of whether they experience any symptoms. South Korea also does this. But the Chinese government changed its classification guidelines on Feb 7, counting only those patients with symptoms as confirmed cases. The United States, Britain and Italy simply do not test people without symptoms, apart from medical workers who have prolonged exposure to the virus. \n The approach taken by China and South Korea of testing anyone who has had close contact with a patient — regardless of whether the person has symptoms — may explain why the two Asian countries seem to have checked the spread of the virus. Hong Kong is extending testing to airport arrivals in the city, even if travellers have no symptoms. Meanwhile in most European countries and the US, where only those with symptoms are tested, the number of infections continues to rapidly rise. \n A growing number of studies are now questioning the WHO's earlier statement that asymptomatic transmission was \"extremely rare\". A report by the WHO's international mission after a trip to China estimated that asymptomatic infections accounted for 1 to 3 per cent of cases, according to a European Union paper. \n \"The number of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) cases worldwide continues to grow, and the gap between reports from China and statistical estimates of incidence based on cases diagnosed outside China indicates that a substantial number of cases are underdiagnosed,\" a group of Japanese experts led by Mr Hiroshi Nishiura, an epidemiologist at Hokkaido University, wrote in a letter to the International Journal of Infectious Diseases in February. \n Based on their research, Mr Nishiura put the proportion of asymptomatic Japanese patients evacuated from Wuhan, ground zero of the outbreak in China, at 30.8 per cent — similar to the classified Chinese government data. \n But official figures from South Korea — which had carried out nearly 300,000 tests on all close contacts of its confirmed cases as of Wednesday — are the most comparable to China's. More than 20 per cent of the asymptomatic cases reported to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention remained without symptoms until they were discharged from hospital. \n \"Korea currently has a significantly higher rate of asymptomatic cases than other countries, perhaps due to our extensive testing,\" Ms Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of South Korea's CDC, told a press briefing on March 16. \n Another useful point of reference is the data collected from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined for weeks in Yokohama, Japan. All of its passengers and crew were tested, with 712 people testing positive — 334 of whom were asymptomatic, according to official Japanese figures. \n An EU report has put the proportion of asymptomatic cases in Italy at 44 per cent, but in most parts of the country people without symptoms are not tested. \n In Hong Kong, 16 of the 138 confirmed cases as of March 14 were asymptomatic or presymptomatic, according to Mr Ho Pak-leung, a professor with the microbiology department of the University of Hong Kong. \n All of these numbers point to a significantly higher ratio of asymptomatic cases than indicated by data publicly released by China so far. There were 889 asymptomatic patients among the 44,672 confirmed cases as of February 11, epidemiologists from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention wrote in a paper published online in JAMA Network Open on February 24. \n The WHO has said the role of asymptomatic transmissions in the spread of the disease was not clear, but carriers without symptoms were unlikely to be a key factor overall. \n However, some scientists are asking whether asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmissions have been underestimated. \n A joint study by experts in China, the US, Britain and Hong Kong estimated that undocumented cases of the pneumonia, mostly with mild or even no symptoms, were the source of infection for 79 per cent of documented ones before Wuhan was locked down on Jan 23. \n \"These undocumented infections often experience mild, limited, or no symptoms and hence go unrecognised, and, depending on their contagiousness and numbers, can expose a far greater portion of the population to the virus than would otherwise occur,\" the specialists from Columbia University, the University of Hong Kong, Imperial College London, Tsinghua University, and the University of California, Davis wrote in the report. \n A separate study by scientists from the University of Texas at Austin estimated that people who had not yet developed symptoms transmitted around 10 per cent of the 450 cases they studied in 93 Chinese cities. Their findings are awaiting publication in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. \n Mr Ho from the University of Hong Kong said some asymptomatic patients had a viral load similar to those with symptoms. \n \"Of course it is hard to say if they may be less infectious if they don't cough. But there are also droplets when you speak,\" he said, referring to how the respiratory virus is transmitted. \n Mr Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiology and biostatistics professor at the University of Hong Kong, said there was \"clear evidence that infected persons could transmit infection before symptoms appear\". \n \"There are many reports of transmission around one to two days before symptom onset,\" he said. \n A better understanding of asymptomatic cases could lead to adjustments in public health policy, experts said. \n \"The asymptomatic ratio ... could be higher among children than in older adults,\" Mr Nishiura wrote in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. \"That would considerably change our scope of the outbreak, and even the optimal interventions can change.\" SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "It was more or less inevitable that one of the most popular fake news in the world released by Twitter about the Chinese and American covid-19. Believing the news, the pandemic virus did not originate in China, but in the USA. This information is at the top of a total of 3180 tweets produced last week and identified as suspects of spreading lies related to the coronavirus by an automatic fake news extraction system designed by the Port Science Faculty and the Institute of Systems Engineering and Computers, Technology and Science (INESC TEC).\nAccording to Nuno Guimaros, the researcher who proposed to develop this system, the increase in fake news about the pandemic on Twitter has been exponential. Preliminary results show that there was a jump from 157 suspected tweets in the first week of February to 658 between 16 to 23 February and 3180 last week. And the trend is to keep rising.\nStatistics refer to tweets produced in English worldwide. Developing since the end of 2018, it is the first time that this software is applied to a specific event. Initially, the system was able to detect fake news on Facebook as well, but was limited to Twitter after Zuckerberg's social network blocked the possibility of extracting this data massively. Also WhatsApp was off-radar because it was a private means of communication, only accessible to those directly involved in exchanging messages. To get around the problem, a MediaLab team at ISCTE-IUL, specializing in fake news, created a number of WhatsApp on purpose and began receiving messages as if they were an individual user. A report from last week on the results of the analysis centered on the early days of the pandemic concluded that audio files are more popular on WhatsApYeah. \"They are very effective because there is emotion contained in the intonation as information is transmitted,\" says the researcher Gustavo Cardoso. A fact-checking team made of the ten most shared files concluded that seven of them contained incorrect facts.\nIn the experience with Twitter, Alvaro Figueira, professor at the Faculty of Porto Sciences, explains that although it is not possible to guarantee the 100% that all situations identified by the system correspond to false information, the degree of probability is very high, and a complex combination of parameters is used, including measuring the level of emotion associated with each tweet. \"Fake news has its own record. They usually use stronger adjectives and are more alarmist.\"But the most reliable criterion is related to the sites to which tweets refer and which have been referred as\"unreliable\"by presenting a history of false news.\nAmong the most popular fake news released on Twitter is the idea that vitamin C has been used in high doses as an effective remedy; the thesis that coronavirus is a combination of several viruses, including HIV, or that there is no limit to the number of reinfections.\nIn the case of the revelation that after all the virus originated in the US, the tweet (sent back after 782 thousand times) was linked to a link referring to a supposed research centre in Canada, where an article presents alleged evidence, including the allusion to (false) news from 2019's \"New York Times\". The thesis: The coronavirus is a biological weapon of American manufacture. Days later, BuzzFeed reported that one of the people who had released the tweet was the spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Minister.",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SEOUL - President Moon Jae-in said on Monday he was increasingly confident South Korea would overcome the coronavirus as the rate of new infections continued to drop, although authorities noted another large cluster had emerged in the greater Seoul area.  \n There were 74 new coronavirus infections reported on Monday, down from 76 on Sunday and marking the second day in a row that the number has been below 100. That is well below a Feb. 29 peak of 909.  \n South Korea has 8,236 confirmed infections - the highest number in Asia outside China - while the death toll rose by four to 79, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).  \n Another 303 patients had been released after recovering, bringing the number of those who had gone home to 1,137.  \n \"Unless there are unexpected developments, we expect this trend will also gain momentum,\" Moon said during a meeting with health officials at Seoul City Hall. \"Our confidence that we can overcome COVID-19 is growing.\"  \n Both Moon and other officials warned against complacency - their remarks coming on the same day that the central bank, in a bid to soften the economic impact of the virus, cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points in an emergency meeting, taking it below 1% for the first time ever.  \n \"For three straight days we have seen more numbers of discharged than newly confirmed, but we should not forget the lessons we’ve learned,\" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told a briefing.  \n There were new clusters from unknown sources in cities other than the hardest hit city of Daegu, Kim said, adding: \"This implies the coronavirus is spreading across the country.\"  \n In Seongnam, south of Seoul, at least 46 members of a Protestant church have tested positive, including the pastor, after services on March 1 and March 8, despite government calls to cancel mass gatherings.  \n \"We have traced 46 confirmed patients linked to the church in Seongnam city since March 9. We are still investigating who those patients had contact with,\" KCDC chief Jeong Eun-kyeong told reporters.  \n Forty other people who came in contact with infected church members also tested positive, he said, noting the cluster was the second-largest in the Seoul metropolitan area.  \n Kim urged people to avoid mass gatherings and adopt \"social distancing\" measures. \"We should not let our guard down.\"  \n This week, South Korea adopted tougher border checks for visitors from Europe, similar to its rules for travellers from China and Iran.  \n The foreign ministry on Monday escalated its travel advisory level for 36 countries in Europe from 1 to 2, the second of four ratings, asking citizens to refrain from travel to the region. The countries affected include Italy, Germany, France and Spain.  \n On Sunday, the government classified the worst-hit South Korean provinces as \"special disaster zones\", allowing the government to subsidise up to half of restoration expenses and exempt residents from taxes and utility payments.

        "news_content_translate_en": "HONG KONG — When a virus enters the human body, it's in a race against time to hijack cells, reproduce and spread. Its survival depends on it, because once the body's immune system detects the intruder an all-out microscopic war follows. \n While the Sars-CoV-2 virus behind the present pandemic has killed thousands and spread fear around the world, the immune system — which has evolved over millions of years of fighting pathogens — shows no such trepidation. It responds with ferocity to obliterate the invader, led by armies of killer T-cells. \n That immune system is one reason the human species still exists, but in some cases its fight against viruses can resemble the scorched-earth policy of warfare, where everything in the area of the conflict takes damage, meaning body tissue itself. The immune system takes no prisoners. \n But before the war at the cellular level, the virus slips into the body, navigating past defences in the mucus that gathers in noses and throats, on the hunt for cells it can commandeer. At the same time, it's trying to disguise its presence to avoid tripping the chemical alarm system of the immune system — a deadly game of hide-and-seek. \n In the first few hours after the pathogen's entry, it was \"almost like a dance between the innate immune response and the virus\", said Mr Gene Olinger, an immunologist with the US-based scientific institute MRIGlobal. The virus tries different tricks to dodge the immune system's many detection devices. \n This was the start of what become an \"arms race\" between the virus and immune system, said Ms Marjolein Kikkert, an associate professor who researches this type of biochemical conflict at Leiden University Medical Centre in the Netherlands. \n \"All viruses, including this one, will have multiple ways that they look to circumvent or suppress immune response ... there's an arms race, especially in the beginning, when the virus is trying to prevent these first responses,\" Ms Kikkert said. \n Once the immune system is triggered and a T-cell finds a body cell that has become a virus factory, it typically latches on and fires molecules that punch through the cell's membrane, killing it and everything inside. \n But as Sars-CoV-2 is a newly discovered virus, researchers have not had enough laboratory time to determine the specifics of how the battle plays out. That leaves questions like why some healthy people infected with Sars-CoV-2 become severely ill and others do not, researchers have said. \n Much of what is suspected about how the body fights back is based on research on the body's immune response to closely related coronavirus infections, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). There are also the clinical records of patients with Covid-19, the disease caused by Sars-CoV-2. \n What that indicates is that \"every part of the immune system is needed to clear this virus\", according to Mr Stanley Perlman, a professor of immunology at the University of Iowa, whose lab is now replenishing its stock of lab mice genetically engineered for research on immune response to Sars. \n As the body's immune response can be so aggressive, researchers say that the war against the virus can do damage that causes fatal repercussions in the body. \n In particular, Sars-CoV-2 attacks the lungs, an especially sensitive battleground. Also, as the immune system tries to fight a virus that it has never before encountered, it can go into overdrive, causing excessive damage to adjoining cells and tissue. \n The body's early-warning system for invading pathogens was multilayered, Ms Kikkert said. An abnormality inside a cell would typically trigger a \"cascade\" of cell signals. \n She said this led to the production of \"alarm bell\" proteins that warned surrounding cells about the presence of the virus and triggered a flood of immune molecules, creating an \"antiviral state\". \n As more alarms sound throughout the body, the Sars-CoV-2 virus races to propagate and attack more cells. When T-cells arrive to hunt, capture and kill infected cells, the lungs become a battleground, swelling with immune cells, molecules and the fluid that they use to navigate. \n Mr Olinger said that once a T-cell found an infected cell it latched on, \"almost like a Velcro connection\". \"These cells will attach and send molecules that go through that cell and start to kill it,\" he said. \n Meanwhile, antibodies, Y-shaped proteins, also arrive and swarm onto the virus, smothering the spikes it uses to attach to healthy cells. Larger white blood cells called macrophages also sweep in, swallowing big clusters of dead virus particles. \n As this cellular carnage spreads, dead cells pile up in the lungs. \n \"They are clogging the airways and reducing the oxygen flow,\" said Ms Ashley St John, an assistant professor at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore who researches immune pathology. \n \"You need that tissue to be able to stretch and fill with oxygen, but at the same time you are filling it with immune cells and fluid ... it can prevent someone who is trying to breathe from getting enough oxygen,\" she said. \n Some patients who recover from this stage, their lungs can heal. Others may recover, but suffer lasting damage. \n China released data at the end of February that indicates that about 80 per cent of the Sars-CoV-2 infections were mild to moderate, while 14 per cent were severe. The remaining 6 per cent of critical patients may have suffered respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiple organ failure. \n Globally, about 3.4 per cent of infected people might die from a Sars-CoV-2 infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) said last week, although that number may change as disease controls evolve. In China, the fatality rate fell during the course of the outbreak and the increase in infections. \n In interviews, researchers said that the exact way Sars-CoV-2 behaved in the body was still being investigated, but it was clear it took the heaviest toll on the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. \n More than 20 per cent of infected people aged over 80 were likely to die. Death rates for those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease are double the average rate, according to statistics from the WHO-China Joint Mission on Covid-19 published at the end of February. \n Some researchers suspect that in the \"hide-and-seek\" period, Sars-CoV-2 compromises the early immune response, either by dividing too rapidly for the system to keep up or disrupting the way the immune system regulates itself. \n There was some evidence this can push a panicked system into overdrive and a \"cytokine storm\" follows that causes tissue inflammation. \n \"With a cytokine storm you have a situation where the brakes aren't working and you have all of these [immune] products [going] out of control ... cells infiltrating into the tissue, breakdown of blood vessels,\" St John said. \n As the body sent out alarms for cells to come to fight the virus, too many or the wrong combination could show up, causing excessive tissue damage, Mr Olinger said. \n \"The lung is the worst place to have that happen. Those cells are there to kill, they are there to encapsulate, and control the infection ... over-response can lead to the damage in the lungs. Cells in that region are not able to transfer oxygen ... it can lead to death of the tissue.\" \n An overwhelming immune response could also lead to death itself, researchers said. \n Getting to the bottom of the \"dance\" between the virus and the immune system's response was something that was hard to do without watching it play out in cells and in animals, Mr Olinger said. \n \"The reality is that until you have the virus in hand you really can't answer a lot of those questions,\" he added. \n \"[This virus] turned science upside down on us, because we know more about the genomic sequence now, whereas in the past other outbreaks that would come way after we had grown the virus and played with it in the laboratory, known how it performs in different cell types.\" \n That is the work now facing researchers like those in Mr Perlman's laboratory as they hope to use mice to get a ringside seat to the fight between Sars-CoV-2 and a mammal immune system. \n Such work needed to be done to work out how to build a Sars-CoV-2 vaccine, Mr Perlman said. \n \"How do you make a vaccine that works well if you are not sure what you need to protect a person from infection?\" SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "香港-当病毒进入人体时，它与时间赛跑，劫持细胞，繁殖和传播。它的生存取决于它，因为一旦身体的免疫系统检测到入侵者，一场全面的微观战争就会随之而来。\n虽然目前这场大流行背后的Sars-CoV-2病毒已经杀死了数千人，并在世界各地传播了恐惧，但经过数百万年与病原体抗争进化而来的免疫系统却没有表现出这样的恐慌。它以凶猛的反应消灭了由大量杀伤性T细胞领导的入侵者。\n这种免疫系统是人类物种仍然存在的原因之一，但在某些情况下，它与病毒的斗争可能类似于焦土战争政策，冲突地区的一切都会受到损害，也就是身体组织本身。免疫系统不需要俘虏。\n但在细胞层面的战争之前，病毒会潜入人体，在鼻腔和喉咙中聚集的黏液中穿过防御屏障，寻找它能占领的细胞。同时，它试图掩盖它的存在，以避免跳过免疫系统的化学警报系统——一个致命的捉迷藏游戏。\n位于美国的MRIGlobal科学研究所的免疫学家吉恩•奥林格表示，在病原体进入后的最初几个小时内，它“几乎就像是先天免疫反应和病毒之间的舞蹈”。这种病毒试图用不同的方法来躲避免疫系统的许多检测设备。\n荷兰莱顿大学医学中心（Leiden University Medical Centre）研究这类生化冲突的副教授马若琳•基克特（Marjolein Kikkert）表示，这是病毒与免疫系统之间“军备竞赛”的开始。\n“所有的病毒，包括这个病毒，都会有多种方式来规避或抑制免疫反应。. 有一场军备竞赛，特别是在一开始，当病毒试图阻止这些最初的反应，”基克特女士说。\n一旦免疫系统被触发，T细胞找到一个已经成为病毒工厂的体细胞，它通常会锁住并激发穿透细胞膜的分子，杀死细胞和细胞内的一切。\n但由于Sars-CoV-2是一种新发现的病毒，研究人员还没有足够的实验室时间来确定这场战斗的具体结果。研究人员说，这就留下了一些问题，比如为什么一些感染了Sars-CoV-2的健康人会变得重病，而其他人却不会。\n人们对人体如何反击的怀疑，很大程度上是基于人体对密切相关的冠状病毒感染（如中东呼吸综合征（Mers）和严重急性呼吸综合征（Sars））的免疫反应的研究。还有由Sars-CoV-2引起的疾病Covid-19的临床记录。\n爱荷华大学（University of Iowa）免疫学教授斯坦利•帕尔曼（Stanley Perlman）表示，这表明“免疫系统的每一部分都需要清除这种病毒”，他的实验室目前正在补充用于研究Sars免疫反应的基因工程实验鼠的库存。\n由于人体的免疫反应是如此具有攻击性，研究人员说，对抗病毒的战争会造成损害，在人体内造成致命的影响。\n特别是Sars-CoV-2攻击肺部，这是一个特别敏感的战场。此外，当免疫系统试图对抗一种它从未遇到过的病毒时，它会进入超速状态，对邻近的细胞和组织造成过度损伤。\nKikkert女士说，人体对入侵病原体的预警系统是多层次的。细胞内的异常通常会触发细胞信号的“级联.\n她说，这导致了“警钟”蛋白的产生，这些蛋白警告周围细胞病毒的存在，并引发大量免疫分子，形成“抗病毒状态”。\n随着越来越多的警报声响彻全身，Sars-CoV-2病毒竞相繁殖和攻击更多的细胞。当T细胞到达目的地猎捕、捕获和杀死受感染的细胞时，肺部就成了战场，充满了免疫细胞、分子和它们用来导航的液体。\n奥林格先生说，一旦T细胞发现一个被感染的细胞，它就会紧紧抓住，“就像尼龙搭扣一样”这些细胞会附着并发送穿过细胞的分子，并开始杀死它。”。\n同时，抗体，Y形蛋白，也会到达并聚集到病毒上，抑制病毒用来附着在健康细胞上的尖峰。更大的白血球被称为巨噬细胞，也会吞噬大量死亡的病毒颗粒。\n随着细胞屠杀的蔓延，死亡细胞堆积在肺部。\n新加坡杜克国立医学院研究免疫病理学的助理教授阿什利·圣约翰女士说：“它们阻塞了呼吸道，减少了氧气的流动。”。\n“你需要那些组织能够伸展和充满氧气，但同时你也在用免疫细胞和液体填充它。。。它可以阻止试图呼吸的人获得足够的氧气，”她说。\n一些从这个阶段恢复的病人，他们的肺可以痊愈。其他人可能康复，但遭受持久的损害。\n中国在2月底公布的数据显示，约80%的Sars-CoV-2感染是轻到中度的，而14%是严重的。其余6%的危重病人可能患有呼吸衰竭、感染性休克和多器官衰竭。\n全球范围内，约3世界卫生组织（WHO）上周表示，有4%的感染者可能死于Sars-CoV-2感染，不过随着疾病控制的发展，这一数字可能会发生变化。在中国，在疫情爆发和感染增加的过程中，死亡率下降。\n在采访中，研究人员表示，目前仍在调查Sars-CoV-2在人体内的确切行为方式，但很明显，它给老年人和免疫系统较弱的人带来的损失最大。\n超过20%的80岁以上的感染者可能死亡。根据世界卫生组织-中国Covid-19联合调查团2月底公布的统计数据，心血管疾病、糖尿病和慢性呼吸系统疾病患者的死亡率是平均死亡率的两倍。\n一些研究人员怀疑，在“捉迷藏”时期，SARS COV-2通过过早地分裂系统来保持或破坏免疫系统调节自身的方式来破坏早期免疫应答。\n有证据表明，这会使惊慌失措的系统进入超速状态，随之而来的“细胞因子风暴”会导致组织炎症。\n“在细胞因子风暴中，你会遇到刹车失灵的情况，所有这些（免疫）产品都失去控制。。。细胞渗入组织，血管破裂，”圣约翰说。\n奥林格表示，当人体发出警报，让细胞来对抗病毒时，可能会出现过多或错误的组合，造成组织过度损伤。\n“肺脏是最糟糕的地方。这些细胞是用来杀死的，它们是用来包裹的，控制感染。。。过度反应会导致肺部损伤。那个区域的细胞不能转移氧气。。。它会导致组织死亡。”\n研究人员说，压倒性的免疫反应也可能导致自身死.\n奥林格表示，要弄清病毒与免疫系统反应之间的“舞蹈”，如果不观察病毒在细胞和动物身上的表现，是很难做到的。\n他补充说：“事实是，除非你手里有病毒，否则你真的无法回答很多这些问题。”。\n“（这种病毒）颠覆了我们的科学，因为我们现在对基因组序列了解得更多，而在过去，在我们培育出病毒并在实验室里进行处理之后，其他病毒爆发的时候，我们知道它在不同细胞类型中的表现。”\n这是像帕尔曼先生的实验室里的研究人员现在面临的工作，他们希望用老鼠在Sars-CoV-2和哺乳动物免疫系统之间的斗争中获得有利地位。\n帕尔曼表示，要想研制出一种Sars-CoV-2疫苗，就需要做这样的工作。\n“如果你不确定你需要什么来保护一个人不受感染，你如何才能制造出一种有效的疫苗？”南华早",

        "news_content_translate_en": "As global makers of household cleaners race to pitch their products as coronavirus killers, one major company, Reckitt Benckiser, may have a leg up on the competition.  \n The maker of Lysol and Dettol disinfectants said it has already obtained a strain of the novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, from an independent lab and plans to use the strain to test whether its products kill the virus.  \n Watchdogs in the United States and Europe stipulate that a product must be tested in a regulator-approved lab to prove it can be effective against 99.9% of a virus before it can make a virus-killing claim on its label or in ads. In 2012, for instance, when MERS-coronavirus was a major public health concern, cleaning products had to prove they could kill 9,999 out of 10,000 MERS-Coronavirus cells, according to the agencies’ requirement.  \n COVID-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus, originated in Wuhan, China, and has spread to more than 100 countries across the world.  \n The pandemic presents both a challenge and an opportunity for marketers of household brands to show how their products can help consumers deal with a frightening and fast-developing public health crisis. Doing it right could mean added market share; doing it badly will likely have other consequences.  \n \"This coronavirus is the new hype,\" said Michael Reynen, the former research head of Procter & Gamble's surface care business in parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  \n British consumer goods maker Reckitt told Reuters it procured a sample of the novel coronavirus strain a few days ago and will soon be testing its existing disinfectants for commercial use at a virology lab.  \n The lab, which Reckitt declined to name, is in the process of duplicating the virus samples to enable sufficient quantities for testing, it said. The lab can test six Reckitt Benckiser products per week, with results of the first batch expected by the end of April, the company said.  \n Before Reckitt can re-label and stock shelves with its Dettol disinfecting sprays and Lysol toilet cleaners, it must complete a battery of regulator-mandated tests that typically take at least six months. It could take over a year if they need to create entirely new coronavirus-killing products.  \n Reckitt’s move, which Reuters could not independently verify, could put some of its rivals on the back foot.  \n At stake are potentially billions of dollars in sales. Consumers spent nearly $22 billion on surface cleaners globally and another $1.43 billion on cleaning wipes in 2019. Clorox has about 4% percent and 37% percent of the surface cleaner and disinfecting wipes categories, respectively, followed by Reckitt, with share of 7.3% and 17.2%.  \n During public health emergencies, such as 'Bird flu,' the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and the 2013 MERS crisis, demand for surface cleaners and disinfecting wipes typically spikes, a Reuters analysis of Euromonitor data shows.  \n  \n 'RUSHING AROUND'  \n Reynen, who held several top research roles in his 24 years at P&G, said companies can spend a few thousand dollars to buy aggressive virus strains like the novel coronavirus from regulator-approved microbiology laboratories, which mail the samples with a glycerin solution in small, deep-frozen vessels.  \n “Procter and Clorox will be rushing around to get a strain,” he said. “If they don't have it in their labs by now, I'd expect they will in the next week or two.”  \n P&G, Clorox and Unilever declined to comment on whether they’re pursuing or have managed to get samples of the novel coronavirus.  \n The companies likely do not have labs sophisticated enough to complete the rigorous six-month testing for a virus as nasty as this, so they outsource most of the work to external labs approved by regulators, a process that could cost about $100,000-$200,000, Reynen said. The contracted labs typically work with top biomedical research organizations such as the private non-profit Institut Pasteur in Paris and the German government agency Robert Koch-Institut in Berlin.  \n As deaths and illnesses from the novel coronavirus mount, companies are resorting to the most powerful claims they can make. The U.S. EPA and European Chemicals Agency do allow for certain carefully-worded statements even in the absence of testing against a strain of the novel coronavirus.  \n For example, Lysol, P&G and Clorox recently created websites promoting awareness, claiming some of their disinfectant products \"demonstrated effectiveness against viruses similar to 2019 Novel Coronavirus\" and \"can be used\" against coronavirus on certain surfaces. P&G also put out a new line of sanitizing products called Microban 24 in late February with TV ads touting they were better than rival Lysol, but the company said the launch was not connected to the coronavirus outbreak.  \n Retail sales for Lysol wipes and rival Clorox wipes rose 184% in the week ended Feb. 29 versus last year, according to data firm Bloomreach. At the same time, shares of Reckitt, P&G and Clorox have outperformed the broader market, which has plunged since the first case of Coronavirus was detected in China on Dec. 31. REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "随着全球家用清洁剂制造商竞相将其产品推销为冠状病毒杀伤者，一家主要公司Reckitt Benckiser可能会在竞争中占上风。\n溶醇消毒剂和滴滴涕消毒剂的制造商说，他们已经从一个独立的实验室获得了一种新型冠状病毒，称为SARS-CoV-2，并计划用这种病毒来测试其产品是否能杀死病毒。\n美国和欧洲的监管机构规定，产品必须在监管机构批准的实验室中进行测试，以证明其能够有效抵御99.9%的病毒，然后才能在其标签或广告上进行病毒杀灭声明。例如，2012年，当MERS冠状病毒成为公众健康的一大问题时，根据该机构的要求，清洁产品必须证明它们可以杀死10000个MERS冠状病毒细胞中的9999个。\nCOVID-19是一种由新型冠状病毒引起的疾病，起源于中国武汉，目前已传播到全球100多个国家。\n这场大流行给家居品牌的营销人员带来了挑战和机会，让他们展示自己的产品如何帮助消费者应对一场可怕的、快速发展的公共卫生危机。做得好可能意味着增加市场份额；做得不好可能带来其他后果。\n“这种冠状病毒是一种新的炒作，”宝洁（Procter&Gamble）在欧洲、中东和非洲部分地区的表面护理业务前研究主管迈克尔•雷恩（MichaelReynen）说。\n英国消费品制造商雷基特（Reckitt）对路透社表示，该公司几天前采购了一种新型冠状病毒株的样本，不久将在一家病毒学实验室对现有消毒剂进行商用测试。\n雷基特拒绝透露实验室的名字，该实验室正在复制病毒样本，以便能够进行足够数量的检测. 该公司说，该实验室每周可以测试6种瑞奇特本基产品，第一批产品的测试结果预计将在4月底公布。\n在Reckitt能够重新贴上标签并用其Dettol消毒喷雾剂和Lysol马桶清洁剂存放货架之前，它必须完成一系列监管机构规定的测试，通常至少需要6个月。如果他们需要开发全新的冠状病毒杀灭产品，可能需要一年多的时间。\n路透社无法独立核实雷基特的这一举动，可能会让一些竞争对手背黑锅。\n潜在的数十亿美元的销售额将受到威胁。2019年，全球消费者在表面清洁剂上花费了近220亿美元，在清洁湿巾上又花费了14.3亿美元。Clorox在表面清洁剂和消毒湿巾类别中分别占4%和37%，其次是Reckitt，分别占7.3%和17.2%。\n路透社对欧睿数据的分析显示，在“禽流感”、2009年H1N1大流行和2013年MERS危机等公共卫生紧急情况下，对表面清洁剂和消毒湿巾的需求通常会激增。\n“四处奔波”\n雷恩在宝洁24年的工作中担任过几项顶级研究职位，他说，公司可以花几千美元从监管机构批准的微生物学实验室购买攻击性病毒株，比如新型冠状病毒，这些实验室将甘油溶液邮寄到深冻的小容器中。\n他说：“普罗克斯特和克罗克斯会四处奔波，以缓解压力。”。“如果他们现在实验室里还没有，我想他们会在未来一两周内拿到。”\n宝洁、Clorox和联合利华拒绝就他们是否在寻找或设法获得新型冠状病毒样本发表评论.\n雷恩说，这些公司可能没有足够成熟的实验室来完成对像这样恶劣的病毒的严格的6个月测试，因此他们将大部分工作外包给监管机构批准的外部实验室，这一过程可能需要大约10万到20万美元。签约的实验室通常与顶级生物医学研究机构合作，如巴黎的私营非营利性巴斯德研究所和柏林的德国政府机构罗伯特·科赫研究所。\n随着新型冠状病毒导致的死亡和疾病不断增加，企业正诉诸于他们能提出的最有力的声明。美国环保署和欧洲化学品署确实允许某些措辞谨慎的声明，即使没有对新型冠状病毒株进行检测。\n例如，Lysol、P&G和Clorox最近创建了提高认识的网站，声称他们的一些消毒剂产品“显示了类似于2019年新型冠状病毒的有效性”，并“可用于”某些表面上的冠状病毒。宝洁公司在2月底还推出了一款名为Microban 24的新型消毒产品，电视广告宣传其优于竞争对手Lysol，但该公司表示，此次上市与冠状病毒爆发无关。\n数据公司Bloomreach的数据显示，截至2月29日的一周，Lysol湿巾和竞争对手Clorox湿巾的零售额较去年增长了184%。与此同时，Reckitt、宝洁和Clorox的股价表现优于大盘，自12月31日中国发现首例冠状病毒以来，大盘大幅下挫。路透社",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Doctors \"had never seen a respiratory pathogen capable of being transmitted to an entire community\", said this Monday the Director General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. This is why the world is in \"unknown territory\", he added, while stressing that Covid-19 can be contained, since the necessary measures were taken in eight countries no new cases were recorded in two weeks, highlighted Ghebreyesus.\nIgnorance favors comparisons, but these must be cautious, alerting experts. Especially when it comes to influenza viruses, curiously called both to devalue the new coronavirus and to argue otherwise. To draw conclusions, nothing like jumping to the facts.\n\"Seasonal influenza and Covid-19 are both infectious respiratory diseases but have important specificities,\" she begins by clarifying Caria Canaries, representing the work commission on respiratory infectiveness of the Portuguese Society of Pneumology. The origin of each disease is distinct. In the case of the current epidemic, it concerns a virus \"with unique characteristics that differ from other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, and which is also different from the influenza virus (disease caused by various types and subtypes of Influenza virus).\nAmong the various designations, the new coronavirus 2019, is also referred to as acute acute acute acute coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, needs the researcher at the University of Lisbon Faculty of Medicine.\nWith the exception that Covid-19 transmission routes are still under investigation, the two viruses have the fact that they can be transmitted from person to person through droplets spread by an infected person, \"more frequently through speech, cough or sneeze\".\nSo far, the new coronavirus seemed to be more contagious than most flu strainsYeah. \"Each person with the new coronavirus appears to infect on average 2,2 other people\", while each person with seasonal influenza appears to infect 1,3 other people on average explains Caria Canaries.\nMore recent data did however bring another reading. \"The World Health Organisation reported this Tuesday that the latest data analysis indicates that Covid-19 is not transmitted as efficiently as the influenza virus\". The researcher explains: \"In influenza, people may be contagious before the symptoms develop, making it difficult to control the spread of the virus, which does not seem to be the case with COVID-19\".\nHowever, and although the number of people infected with coronavirus is unknown who have only very mild symptoms or none, evidence from China suggests that only 1% of reported cases have no symptoms and that most develop symptoms within two days.\nSimilar symptoms are involved, usually sudden onset, including fever, cough, myalgia (body pain), malaise and headache. There may also be vomiting and diarrhea. Both diseases \"may evolve into various clinical situations: from asymptomatic infection to viral pneumonia, and may in some cases evolve into a fatal pathology\".\nA recent study with nearly 140 patients at Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University, epicenter of the outbreak, identified a pattern typical of the symptoms associated with the new coronavirus. High fever was the main symptom, in 99% of cases, while more than half of the patients presented tiredness and a dry cough. One third reported muscle pain and difficulty breathing. A minority complained of diarrhea and nausea one or two days before these symptoms.\nBoth coronavirus and influenza are more dangerous for people over 65 years old, who have chronic diseases or have a weakened immune systeYeah. The World Health Organisation warns, however, that the new virus causes more serious cases of disease than seasonal influenza, underlines Caria Canaries.\nIt is not known whether the new coronavirus poses a serious threat to pregnant women, while in the case of influenza the associated risks are recognised.\nAs for children, infections with the new coronavirus tend to show mild or non-existent symptoms. Even in the case of influenza, it is more severe, especially in very young children.\nAunt Canary points out that \"there is still no conclusive answer to this question\". Although Covid-19's mortality rate is currently considered higher than most influenza viruses, the true mortality rate may be similar to that of a severe seasonal influenza.\nThe earliest estimates of the coronavirus mortality rate in China, the epicenter of the outbreak, were about 2%. There are, however, more recent studies that indicate a lower rate in China, 1,4%, refers to the specialist. But \"it is believed that there may be many light cases or no symptoms that have not been detected, which would lead to an even lower mortality rate by coronavirus, less than 1%\".\nAntibiotics treat none of the viruses, since they only work on bacterial infections, it's never too much to remember.\nFor influenza, antiviral medicines are \"approved specifically for this situation\" and \"more effective when started one or two days after the onset of symptoms\".\nThere are no approved antiviral medicines for the new virus dye, although some are being tested. This is why only supportive treatment is given: patients are medicated for the relief of symptoms as they arisYeah.\nLike influenza, Covid-19 can cause pneumonia and respiratory problems, and patients with a more serious medical condition \"may need specific hospital care and/or respiratory care, such as oxygen administration or mechanical ventilation\".\nMost people globally developed immunity for seasonal influenza, which is not the case for Covid-19.\nAfter viral infections occur, people usually develop antibodies that fight the virus and protect them against future infections, so \"it is reasonable to assume that people who have had the new coronavirus will have immunity\", says Caria Canaries. \"However, it is not known how long this immunity may last and if it really exists\", alerts the expert, adding that \"in case of co-existence of infection with other coronaviruses, immunity may decrease\".\nWithout any vaccine approved for the coronavirus, a total of 20 are currently in development.\nAlthough recent references to the possibility that the rise in temperature may reduce the cases of Covid-19, the representative of the Working Committee on Respiratory Infectivity of the Portuguese Pneumology Society emphasizes that, \"Since this is a new virus, there is no information available to us to infer how climate can affect coronavirus infection.\"\nAdditionally, Katia Canaries adds, \"even if the virus declines in the spring, there is a risk of reappearance in late autumn, standard seen with influenza.",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Climate scientists tell us that climate change will not only bring about rising sea levels and more extreme weather events, it also increases the likelihood of epidemics. But despite the clear linkage between the two, our response to the current Covid-19 pandemic is almost completely opposite to our usual response to climate change. \n While the coronavirus can be fatal, the risk that one will die from the disease is (still) low. Nonetheless, governments in hard hit areas have acted promptly to declare “war” on the pandemic while societies have made large sacrifices to contain the disease. \n With climate change, while the impacts are far greater in terms of loss of lives and risk to the very survival of the human species, mitigating climate change is seldom a priority in a government’s resource allocation decisions. \n In short, we respond to epidemics (when they occur) with excessive fear and pessimism, even as we routinely discount the risks of, and are naively optimistic about, the very thing that makes them more likely. \n In dealing with low-probability, high-dread events such as dying from Covid-19, we systemically overestimate our risks — much like how people overestimate their risks of dying in a terrorist attack or a plane crash relative to far more common causes of death. \n On the other hand, people and institutions underestimate the high (and increasing) risk of climate catastrophe. How do we explain this paradox? \n PROBABILITY NEGLECT, PRESENT BIAS AND GLOBAL COMMONS \n Our overestimation of risks linked to the coronavirus and our underestimation of climate risks are two sides of the same coin; they are explained by a bias called probability neglect. \n When dealing with risks (whether the risk of an epidemic or of climate change), we do not rely on actual probabilities but on how easily the risk comes to mind (saliency bias), our instincts, and our instant emotive reactions (the affect heuristic). \n The coronavirus is very salient; we are constantly inundated by news of it and daily updates of the numbers infected and dead around the world. It also evokes strong emotional reactions, especially fear. Salience combined with fear causes us to believe that something is far more probable than it is. \n Climate change is exactly the opposite. It is usually not salient as most people believe it will occur in some distant future. Climate change also does not evoke strong emotional responses in most people, except possibly for the young. Being an abstraction for most people, climate risks are systematically underestimated. \n The result of our collective fear is that governments prioritise the “war” against the Covid-19 pandemic, often at the expense of other priorities. \n Global supply chains have also been disrupted; financial markets are roiled by the news of the disease spreading and of rising number of infections. \n The different responses to coronavirus and climate change also stem from what is known as present-biased preferences. People tend to overvalue immediate costs or benefits while discounting long-term impacts. \n In the case of the coronavirus, people are willing to make immediate sacrifices as there are short-term benefits, that of being protected from a potentially life-threatening disease.  \n With climate change, people are reluctant to incur even small costs today because the benefits (such as the survival of mankind and preservation of the natural environment) are in the future and, therefore, heavily discounted.  \n Climate change and epidemics are both problems of the global commons. Effective solutions require cooperation and coordination between governments.  \n But such cooperation is difficult because every country has an incentive to free ride on the efforts of others. \n With epidemics, this free-rider problem is less pronounced as the domestic costs of an epidemic are high enough for most governments to take some preventive measures. \n With climate change, the free-rider problem (and the consequent tragedy of commons) seems more insurmountable. \n The benefits of not taking any climate action are internalised (that is, the benefits are fully captured by the country not taking climate action), while the costs to the global commons are externalised (that is, the costs are shared or distributed to the rest of the world). \n LESSONS FOR CLIMATE ACTION \n First, there is an opportunity for those of us who wish to see more resolute climate action to use the coronavirus crisis to emphasise the causal link between climate change and epidemics.  \n Our message to governments and our fellow citizens should be: “If you do not wish to live with more of such viruses, we must take far more aggressive action on climate change.” \n Second, there are many things governments can do to highlight the salience of climate risks. \n For example, just as the number of confirmed infections and deaths from the coronavirus has been highly visible, governments should also provide regular information on the costs and damages of climate change, as well as how these are expected to rise. \n Third, governments can take steps to counter our present bias. With the coronavirus, the benefits of governments taking aggressive action now are clear for all to see.  \n With climate change, governments need to find ways to create a sense of crisis to persuade their populations that the costs of climate change are already upon us, and that the sacrifices needed to deal with it cannot be delayed anymore. \n Finally, the costs of climate change do not have to be fully internalised for countries to take action; they only need to be sufficiently internalised.  \n That the coronavirus began in China, the fastest growing emitter of carbon emissions, also creates an opportunity for China to play a leadership role in climate change mitigation. By doing so, China would also reduce the risks of future epidemics. \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHORS: \n Donald Low is senior lecturer and professor of practice in public policy at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where Xun Wu is professor and head of the Division of Public Policy.

        "news_content_translate_en": "HONG KONG — As the coronavirus continues to spread around the world, China has one important lesson for other governments in fighting the disease — be prepared to pay so that patients won't let costs deter them from getting tests and treatment. \n The coronavirus — which causes a disease called Covid-19 — has spread to more than 100 countries, with Italy, Iran and South Korea emerging as growing epicentres of the epidemic. \n Italy has reported more than 10,000 cases of infection, overtaking South Korea as the worst affected country outside China. The United States has also begun to report more confirmed cases as health authorities cleared some restrictions that had limited the availability of testing for the contagion. \n But in China, where the disease was first reported, the epidemic is waning, with 24 new cases of infection reported on Wednesday (March 11). \n A coronavirus test reportedly costs about 370 yuan (S$74) in China. And in the southern city of Shenzhen, the average cost of treating the disease ranged from 23,000 yuan for elderly patients to about 5,600 yuan for minors, the Chinese Hospital Management journal reported on Feb 28. \n Some of the country's treatment methods such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation — which artificially oxygenates a patient's blood for a limited period of time — are expensive but they are all covered by the government, which has earmarked 110.48 billion yuan for treatment, subsidies for medical staff and medical equipment. \n In the US, where there have been 25 deaths among 696 confirmed cases, public anxiety is growing over the cost of testing. \n The US government does not charge for coronavirus confirmation tests at designated laboratories but a trip to the hospital will incur other hefty expenses, in one case over US$3,200 (S$4,448). Insurance lobby group America's Health Insurance Plans said individuals needed to check their insurance providers for coverage of costs related to Covid-19. \n As of Monday, only 1,707 people had been tested by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. More tests may have been conducted at lower level public health laboratories but the number of infections could also be bigger, according to a new Cedars-Sinai study, which estimated that between 1,043 and 9,484 people in the US may have been infected by March 1. \n South Korea, with more than 7,700 Covid-19 patients as of Wednesday, announced in January that the government and insurance companies would cover the expenses associated with examination, isolation and treatment for coronavirus patients. The country has greatly expanded testing stations to include drive-through services and tested about 15,000 people a day. \n Japan designated Covid-19 as an infectious disease in February, making it the government's responsibility to pay inpatient bills related to the coronavirus infection. \n In Britain, about 18,000 people have received free testing since last month, and 382 have been confirmed as infected as of Wednesday. \n Professor Dirk Pfeiffer, chair professor of One Health at City University's Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, said affordability would hinder the epidemic control efforts. \n \"Clearly, wherever you have to pay for health care, individuals with mild symptoms in the lower-income groups will hesitate to visit a health care facility, and that may also be the case in some individuals with severe disease. These behaviours will extend the epidemic,\" Mr Pfeiffer said. \n But he said aggressive testing was not realistic in most countries and social distancing would continue to be the most important risk mitigation measure. \n \"I don't think large-scale testing is realistic in most countries because of the sheer number of tests required. And even where it is feasible, it will not eradicate the virus from the population. Therefore, testing would have to remain risk-based, focusing, for example, on those in contact with known cases,\" he said. \n Mr Pfeiffer said that in Western democratic societies, social distancing would be based mostly on voluntary compliance in contrast to China where tests were mandatory under the country's infectious disease control regulations. \n \"The consequence of this difference will be that the epidemic will take longer in the countries where social distancing is voluntary,\" he said. \n Mr Ni Feng, director of the Institute of American Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said China and the US had different conditions and it was understandable they used different strategies, but China's success in bringing the epidemic under control could be a good opportunity for both countries to work together. \n \"This is the least-sensitive area. There are many fields where the two countries can cooperate. We saw some solid cooperation in the past with Sars, H5N1 and H7N9 aviation influenza outbreaks, but not this time,\" Mr Ni said.

We must continue to help China during this difficult period of fighting the virus.” \n Dr Balakrishnan said that his Chinese counterpart had “conveyed China’s understanding of the actions we had taken due to the unique circumstances faced by Singapore”. China had also expressed their gratitude for Singapore’s efforts and support during the health crisis. \n Singapore has sent testing equipment and test kits developed here to Wuhan, as well as personal protective equipment and other medical supplies. More than S$6 million were raised by the Singapore Red Cross for affected communities in China, he said. \n Besides China, Dr Balakrishnan said that his ministry has also been working with the international community to tackle Covid-19, including the Special Meeting of the Asean Coordinating Council and the Special Asean-China Foreign Ministers Meeting in Vientiane, Laos last month, where delegates “reaffirmed the importance of openness, decisiveness and co-operation to collectively address the crisis”. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The spread of Covid-19 and the imminence of a major pandemic can affect global geopolitics and is putting governments before difficult social problems. Analysts heard by Lusa agency believe that a pandemic can create \"pandemonium\" situations and stress that several rulers fear the future of a global catastrophe. social repercussions of the uncontrolled spread of the virus in a \"global village\" where phenomena do not recognise borders.\nOne visible case of this concern is the US President: concerned about the impact of the new coronavirus on his re-election attempt in November, Trump prevented a US citizen, who had been infected on the Diamond Princess ship in Japan, from being treated in his Alabama home state, Calling Republican Senator Richard Shelby to make sure he followed his instructions.\nAnalysts say the impact of Covid-19 on the US elections may be a \"double edged knife\": in the first hypothesis, the US economy is affected in the long term, weakening Trump's position, which has used the flag of economic performance; in the second scenario, the outbreak is short-lived, affecting the production of assets for a few months, with the offer to resume on the eve of the election, in a compact way, favoring Trump's position.\nAccording to American Political Journal, Trump has already asked his advisors to examine all scenarios and has requested a detailed report on emergency measures from the CDC. The CDC, in a document that was made public, warned the US President about the risk that \"the public health system will become overcrowded, with high rates of hospitalization and deaths\", and warned about the impact of a pandemic on transport systemsYeah.\nThe problem is global and the big variable is to know what size it will reach, says Jose Pedro Teixeira Fernandes, researcher at the Portuguese Institute for International Relations (IPRI-Nova). In statements to Lusa, this expert warns of the risks governments are taking if a pandemic spreads over long periods of time.\n\"The problem is of degree\", explains Teixeira Fernandes, referring to a situation that may involve many thousands of infected people in the same country over a long period, affecting not only health services, but also the supply chains of essential goods.\nFor the time being, in Europe, where cases of infection are beginning to multiply in various regions, governments are looking for mechanisms to contain the disease by triggering administrative mechanisms to isolate the virus.\nEven in France, where there is a strong tradition of individual rights, which make it impossible, for example, for a person who decides to disappear, to be sought by the police, even under the pretext of \"family interest\", the government has announced that it will make compulsory entry for infected people.\nThe topic of mandatory admission of an infected patient with a highly contagious virus is being discussed in several countries, including Portugal, where experts are divided in the legal reading of the solutions.\nConstantino Sakellarides, a specialist in Public Health and who was responsible for the Directorate-General for Health in Portugal, stated that Portuguese law allows the compulsory quarantine of a patient infected with a virus and even provides for the possibility of declaring a state of calamity, which should be proposed by the Government to the President of the Republic.\nOn the contrary, Francisco George, who was also Director-General of Health, considers that it will be necessary to make amendments to the Constitution to institute mandatory internment for public health reason\" In Portugal, it is time for Members of the Assembly of the Republic to amend Article 27(h) of Article 27(3) of the Constitution to allow compulsory entry for public health reasons. \"Unadiable\", wrote Francisco George, in an article of opinion recently released in the public diary.\nCaroline Barnett, professor of public health at the University of Paris, says the risk of this kind of measure increases with the size of the problem. The problem is when the state seeks mandatory admittance of hundreds or thousands of people, often without ensuring proper conditions for all these internments,\"Barnett said to Lusa, referring to a scenario that may occur in several countries in the short term.\nFor this specialist, an uncontrolled virus spreading situation can lead to a political pandemonium, with several governments having to recognise the inability to deal with thousands of dead people and health-care systems lacking in the means to welcome millions of infected people.\nIn Europe, the European Commission seeks solutions that are less intrusive than mandatory interbreeding, with mechanisms for isolating the spread of the virus which avoid the need for compulsory interbreeding, in particular by activating the European Civil Protection Pool- an organisation established to expedite coordination of efforts between member countries to respond quickly to disasters.\nA major political decision in the European Community concerns the closure of borders in the Schengen area, which the European Commission said this week is not yet being considered. The European Commissioner for Food Health and Safety, Stella Kyriakides, said that the World Health Organisation advised no restrictions in Europe to justify the removal of this solutioYeah.\nMr Pedro Teixeira Fernandes recalls that such a measure goes against the very spirit of Schengen, but recognises that an emergency situation can justify it over a short period of time.\nThe governments of Italy and France, whose countries border them, have announced that they are aware of this possibility, after the Italian provinces of Lombardy and Veneto have been heavily affected by the spread of the new coronavirus. Moreover, the Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, has been criticised by regional authorities for the most relaxed way in which he has addressed the issue of coronavirus, even criticizing local decisions on school closures and other public spaces.\nConte tried to allay fears that his government might not be able to contain the virus after being forced to admit that a hospital in northern Italy had deficiently treated an infection case, contributing to the spread of Covid-19.\nPolitically, the most delicate border is the one separating Italy from Austria, two countries which are in open confrontation around the discussion of the European budget and which also seem to have different views on how best to contain the coronavirus. The Austrian Government has already indicated that it would like to see the borders better guarded, but the Italian Government has already said that it sees no reason to suspend Schengen by asking the European Commission to quickly release the fund of 232 million euros to contain the spread of Covid-19.\nDiplomatically, the problem is also being used as an excuse to regulate the increasing flow of Chinese tourists in some Asian regions. Singapore authorities are blocking the entry of Chinese into the territory after the Minister of Business and Industry of this territory announced that the tourist area was overly dependent on China, using virus protection measures to justify medium- and long-term measures in moderation of entrYeah.\nTeixeira Fernandes recalls that the Covid-19 case is a serious threat to China's position, an early focus of the epidemic, at a time when it is launching its economic expansion programme, especially towards the United States, with whom it has been waging a trade war for almost two years.\nThe IPRI-Nova specialist also recalls another case of a country in conflict with the United States, Iran, which is also facing a serious problem of spreading the virus, which will also be fragile in the face of its enemies",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON - The Trump administration is asking Congress for $2.5 billion to fight the fast-spreading coronavirus, including more than $1 billion for vaccines, the White House said on Monday.  \n With financial markets falling on concerns that the virus will have a significant impact on the global economy, the Trump administration is eager to show it is prepared to combat the virus despite the limited number of cases so far in the United States.  \n The virus has spread to some 29 countries and territories beyond mainland China, with outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Italy. [L3N2AO07M]  \n \"The Trump administration continues to take the spread of the COVID-19 Coronavirus Disease very seriously. Today, the administration is transmitting to Congress a $2.5 billion supplemental funding plan to accelerate vaccine development, support preparedness and response activities and to procure much needed equipment and supplies,\" said Rachel Semmel, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget.  \n The money will be used for therapeutics, vaccine development and the stockpiling of personal protective equipment such as masks, the White House said.  \n Of the $2.5 billion request, $1.5 billion represents new funding. The rest would come from funds already budgeted by Congress, such as unused money to fight the Ebola virus. The administration requires congressional approval to redirect that money to fight the coronavirus.  \n House of Representatives Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, a Democrat, said in a statement the Trump administration's funding request was \"woefully insufficient to protect Americans from the deadly coronavirus outbreak.\"  \n House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said late on Monday that the supplemental funding requested by Trump is \"undersized\" and \"completely inadequate to the scale of this emergency\".  \n \"The House will swiftly advance a strong, strategic funding package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis,\" Pelosi said in a statement.  \n The United States has not seen the virus spread through its communities the way that China and other countries have experienced, but health officials are preparing for the possibility even as Americans affected so far have been quarantined.  \n There have been 53 confirmed U.S. cases of the new coronavirus so far - 14 in people diagnosed in the United States and 39 among Americans repatriated from the outbreak's epicentre of Wuhan, China, and from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  \n  \n TRAVEL WARNING  \n U.S. health officials have warned that cases among repatriated citizens will likely increase.  \n The CDC warned Americans on Monday to avoid travel to South Korea because of the virus.  \n \"We have aggressively worked to combat the spread of this virus, tried to prevent it as best we could from coming into this country,\" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters earlier on Monday.  \n Trump has been at odds with his own White House advisers over China's coronavirus response. He has sought to downplay the impact of the virus, saying it could fade in April with warmer weather - something health experts said is unknown.  \n Trump has praised the work of Chinese President Xi Jinping, even as his advisers have questioned the reliability of the information Beijing has shared on the virus and expressed frustration over its reluctance to accept U.S. expertise in combating it.  \n The Trump administration is also grappling with where to send Americans evacuated from the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the virus after backing off plans to quarantine them in a federal facility in Alabama.  \n In a statement on Monday, HHS cited a \"rapidly evolving situation,\" but said the Alabama centre was \"not needed at this time\" and that it was looking for alternatives.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Although it is still far too early to say the worst is over, the Covid-19 outbreak appears to have tapered off in Singapore in the past week, several experts said on Friday (Feb 21), four weeks after the coronavirus was first confirmed here. \n However, there is a growing concern that further cases of the infection could arrive from countries outside China and disrupt this recent positive streak, four infectious health diseases experts said in giving their take on the broad Covid-19 picture to date. \n Since the peak of confirmed cases a week ago, when nine cases were confirmed here in one day, Feb 14, experts noted that the number of new cases detected has fallen steadily, although there is no way to be certain that another surge will not happen. \n On both Thursday and Friday only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 in Singapore was reported by the Ministry of Health (MOH). \n On Wednesday, three cases were reported, including a 57-year-old woman who had initially been admitted to hospital for dengue fever. It was later confirmed she had both Covid-19 and dengue. \n No new clusters of local transmission have been detected for several days and most of the latest cases can all be traced back to earlier ones. A large number of patients confirmed with the disease have been discharged from the hospitals where they had been isolated. \n “The hysteria will quieten down in the next month unless something unexpected happens,\" Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) research policy and co-operation department in Geneva told TODAY. \n \"But, as I have said, the virus will most likely remain in the population. In my view? Normalise everything and learn to live with the virus,” he added. \n Recent reports from China, where the disease Covid-19 originated, have suggested that new transmission of the virus that causes it, Sars-CoV-2, has also fallen dramatically over the last few days. \n Referring to this trend, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had said that Chinese data “appears to show a decline in new cases’’ but noted that any apparent trend “must be interpreted very cautiously”. \n Using data made available by the Singapore MOH, TODAY looked at how the pace of the Covid-19 outbreak has changed over the past four weeks since Case 1, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident who arrived in Singapore on Jan 20 and was confirmed with the disease on Jan 23. \n DOWNWARD TREND IN THE NUMBER OF CASES IN PAST WEEK \n  \n Looking at the daily number of confirmed cases, the Covid-19 situation appears to have slowed in the past week, with a sharp drop in the number of cases from the record of nine on Feb 14 to one confirmed case on Friday. \n Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, said it looks like the number of cases found on Feb 13 and 14, mostly arising from the Grace Assembly of God cluster, appears to be the peak of the outbreak in Singapore. \n \"The number of cases is coming down,” said Dr Leong. \n He noted that Singapore has been doing hundreds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests per day — the test used to detect Covid-19 — and these cases must be seen in that context. \n “This means that we are truly looking for a needle in the haystack, which means the number of cases is truly low. There are very few, if not no cases of active transmission in Singapore,” he said. \n Agreeing with Dr Leong, Dr Pangestu said that the supposed peak outbreak here on Feb 14 is consistent with earlier scientific models that predicted that the number of new infections of the Covid-19 virus would peak in mid to late February. Chinese scientist Zhong Nanshan, the eminent 83-year-old epidemiologist who had discovered the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, had given the same prediction as well. \n One study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted a February peak based on the basic reproductive number of Covid-19, which is the expected number of cases directly generated by one patient. For Covid-19, this number averages between 1.5 and 4.5. \n Biostatistician Alex Cook, who is the vice dean of research at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said it is “certainly a good thing that the number of cases has been going down”. \n “(This falling trend) reflects the cases to identify and be isolated, and the efforts of MOH to conduct contact tracing, and healthcare workers to minimise infection in hospitals,” said Associate Professor Cook, who is the domain leader for biostatistics and modelling at the school. \n His colleague, Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, the school’s programme leader of infectious diseases and the co-director of global health, added that the fall in the number of confirmed cases in the past week indicates that Singapore’s efforts have been successful in limiting the spread of Covid-19. \n “It is likely that current massive contact tracing — initiated right at the start of the outbreak in Singapore — has led to the majority of cases being uncovered. Current quarantine and social distancing measures have also worked to reduce transmission in Singapore,” said Assoc Prof Hsu. \n FEWER NEW PRIMARY CASES DETECTED IN RECENT WEEKS \n  \n A key indicator is the number of primary cases found on a given day — patients who have had no known link to previous cases and could have contracted the virus through local transmission. \n Singapore upgraded its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) alert level to Orange on Feb 7 when it discovered another three such primary cases, including Case 32, a Victoria Junior College teacher who had no recent travel history to China and no known link to the earlier cases. \n While finding these primary cases helps the authorities discover new ones through contact-tracing, they also highlight that there are more unknowns about how the Covid-19 situation is spreading in the community, said experts. \n But in the past week, no new cluster and fewer primary cases have appeared. The exceptions are the recently discovered Case 82, a 57-year-old Singaporean who had contracted both dengue and Covid-19, and Case 85, a 35-year-old Chinese national who did not travel to China recently. \n As these cases were confirmed only recently, a link could be established later when more detailed contact tracing has taken place. \n Commenting on this trend of fewer primary cases in the past week, Prof Pangestu said he hoped this would help to calm the public. \n While it could also mean that potential primary cases are still hidden from view, it is unlikely as the Singapore Government has been “very vigilant” in contact tracing. The trend shows that infected people have been effectively detected, isolated and treated. \n “It’s the nature of these epidemics — they start explosively and then run out of steam as public health measures kick in and the virus runs out of susceptible hosts.” \n Dr Leong noted that with Singapore expanding its case definitions to screen all patients with pneumonia for Covid-19, it is unlikely that cases would fall under the radar. \n But Singapore’s strengths in contact tracing will still be limited by the ability for patients to recall where they have been and with whom they have interacted, which could account for those cases with no known links, he said. \n “Lousy recollection means lousy contact tracing, which leads to lousy curtailment. We need to think out of the box,” said Dr Leong, suggesting that there should be a mobile phone application that is able to help build Singapore’s capability in contact tracing in future. \n LARGE PORTION OF EARLIER CASES DISCHARGED \n  \n Experts also noted that a majority of the cases detected in the first two weeks of the outbreak have been discharged, a trend that is similar to the experience in other countries. This high rate of discharges is also a sign that the Covid-19 situation is improving in Singapore. \n As of Friday, 47 out of the 86 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. The number of cases in critical condition — five currently — has also come down. \n The number of discharged cases does not include Covid-19 patients who do not suffer from any symptoms throughout their infection but are still hospitalised. \n Assoc Prof Hsu noted that in this regard, data published out of China and other countries has been similar. \n “Covid-19 infections are mild for more than 80 per cent of patients, which means these patients would not have needed hospitalisation based on medical needs alone. The patients were kept isolated in hospital to minimise the risk that they would spread the virus to others in the community,” he said. \n While there is no known vaccine for the disease yet, in Singapore and elsewhere, Covid-19 patients are treated with a mix of antiviral drugs normally used for HIV cases, such as ritonavir and lopinavir. These have been promising, Professor Tan Chorh Chuan, MOH’s chief health scientist said previously. \n Besides Singapore becoming more adept at treating Covid-19, there is also the chance that the virus could be turning milder which would explain why the newer cases are not so severe, said Dr Leong. \n Of the cases in China, Covid-19 has a mortality rate of around 2.3 per cent. By comparison, Sars had a mortality rate of 9.6 per cent during the 2003 outbreak, while Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) has a fatality rate of 35 per cent. \n The mortality rate of Covid-19 outside China — based on a small number of deaths — is lower still, at around 0.2 per cent, which is similar to swine flu and slightly above the seasonal flu. \n Prof Pangestu added: “The implication of this? It simply proves that most cases of Covid-19 are not severe and people should not be unduly concerned. It’s just like the flu and Zika.” \n MAJORITY OF CASES WITH NO LINK TO CHINA \n  \n However, a concerning statistic has emerged in recent weeks: Cases that cannot be traced back to mainland China have now exceeded those with a known link to China, said experts. \n Dr Leong said while it is no cause for alarm, the fact that a majority of cases have no link to China shows how close Singapore came to losing the ability to contain the viral spread from China. \n He said strong contact tracing helped to rein in the numbers, otherwise the unknown cases would continue to mount. \n “The first round of infection comes from China. The second round comes from locals who were infected with contact with the Chinese. That is expected in any ongoing epidemic. It is crucial to keep the lid on the second group and we seem to have done it,” said Dr Leong. \n But the experts suggested that something more surreptitious could be at play given the mounting travel restrictions against China. There is a growing concern that undetected cases of Covid-19 may be entering Singapore from other countries. \n Said Dr Leong: “Within China, the numbers are coming down and it is good that viral spread in the source (country) is being controlled. But the more important question is those who have left China and seeded to countries with less resources — can they take the heat?” \n Covid-19 cases outside China are growing at an accelerating rate. The number of new cases detected outside China climbed at a steady rate since Feb 7, and crossed the threshold of 100 new daily cases for the first time on Feb 17 and has remained high ever since. \n While the number of imported cases of Covid-19 in Singapore has been negligible after Singapore put in place border control measures, Assoc Prof Cook predicts that this could climb again, with increasing numbers of imports from other countries seeding more clusters in Singapore. \n “In normal times there is a lot of travel to and from Singapore and places like Japan and Thailand, both of which have quite large numbers of confirmed cases,” he said. \n Given Singapore’s close proximity and connections to Malaysia and Indonesia, Assoc Prof Cook said he is also concerned about the risk of future importation from these two nations. Indonesia has zero detected cases of Covid-19, though a Harvard study had questioned whether this was due to its lack of detection rather than the incidence of the virus. \n “With more cases being observed beyond China it looks far too early to celebrate,” said Assoc Prof Cook. \n   \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "新加坡——尽管说最坏的情况已经过去还为时过早，但几位专家周五（2月21日）表示，在冠状病毒首次在新加坡被证实4周后，Covid-19在新加坡的爆发似乎在过去一周逐渐减弱。\n然而，四位传染病专家在介绍迄今为止广泛的Covid-19照片时说，人们越来越担心，更多的感染病例可能来自中国以外的国家，并破坏最近的这种积极势头。\n自一周前确诊病例高峰出现以来，2月14日一天内这里确诊9例，专家指出，新发现病例数量稳步下降，但无法确定不会再次出现激增。\n周四和周五，新加坡卫生部（MOH）仅报告了一例Covid-19新确诊病例。\n星期三，报告了三个病例，其中包括一名57岁的妇女，她最初因登革热入院。后来证实她同时患有Covid-19和登革热。\n几天来没有发现新的本地传输集群，最新的大多数病例都可以追溯到早期病例。大量确诊患有此病的病人已从隔离的医院出院。\n李光耀公共政策学院（Lee Kuan-Yew School of Public Policy）访问学者、世界卫生组织（世卫组织）日内瓦研究政策与合作部前主任蒂基·艾尔卡·潘盖斯托教授今天表示：“除非发生意外，否则歇斯底里症将在下个月平息下来。”。\n“但是，正如我所说，这种病毒很可能仍然存在于人群中。在我看来？使一切正常化，学会与病毒共存，”他补充说.\nCovid-19病毒的发源地中国最近的报告显示，导致它的新病毒Sars-CoV-2在过去几天也急剧下降。\n在谈到这一趋势时，世卫组织总干事特德罗·阿德南姆·盖布雷耶苏曾表示，中国的数据“似乎显示新病例有所下降”，但他指出，任何明显的趋势“都必须非常谨慎地加以解释”。\n利用新加坡卫生部提供的数据，今天研究了自1号病例（66岁武汉居民，于1月20日抵达新加坡，并于1月23日确诊患有该病）以来，Covid-19疫情爆发的速度在过去四周内发生了怎样的变化。\n上周病例数下降趋势\n从每日确诊病例数来看，Covid-19的情况在过去一周似乎有所放缓，病例数从2月14日的9例锐减至周五的1例确诊病例。\n伊丽莎白山医院传染病专家梁浩南博士说，2月13日和14日发现的病例数量，似乎是新加坡爆发疫情的高峰期，这些病例大多来自上帝集团的恩典大会。\n“病例数量正在下降，”梁医生说。\n他指出，新加坡每天都要进行数百次聚合酶链反应（PCR）检测，这种检测方法用于检测Covid-19，这些病例必须在这种情况下才能看到。\n“这意味着我们正在大海捞针，这意味着案件数量确实很低。在新加坡，即使没有主动传播的病例，也很少。”。\n潘杰图博士同意梁振英博士的观点，他说，2月14日在这里出现的爆发高峰与先前的科学模型相一致，后者预测Covid-19病毒的新感染人数将在2月中下旬达到高峰. 83岁的著名流行病学家、发现Sars病毒的中国科学家钟南山也给出了同样的预测。\n伦敦卫生和热带医学院的一项研究根据Covid-19的基本生殖数量预测了2月份的高峰，这是一名患者直接产生的预期病例数。对于Covid-19，这个数字平均在1.5到4.5之间。\n生物统计学家亚历克斯·库克（Alex Cook）是Saw-Swee-Hock公共卫生学院的副院长，他说“病例数量下降无疑是件好事”。\n“这一下降趋势反映了需要识别和隔离的病例，以及卫生部进行接触追踪的努力，以及医护人员减少医院感染的努力，”库克副教授说，他是该校生物统计学和建模领域的负责人。\n他的同事、该校传染病项目负责人、全球卫生联合主任徐立扬副教授补充说，过去一周确诊病例数量的下降表明，新加坡在限制Covid-19的传播方面取得了成功。\n“目前的大规模接触追踪很可能是在新加坡疫情爆发之初就开始的，导致大多数病例被发现。目前的隔离和社会隔离措施也有助于减少在新加坡的传播。\n近几周新发现的原发病例较少\n一个关键的指标是在一天内发现的原发性病例的数量，这些病例与以前的病例没有已知的联系，并且可能通过本地传播感染了病毒.\n新加坡在2月7日将疾病爆发反应系统状态（Dorscon）警报级别提升至橙色，发现了另外三个这样的主要病例，其中包括病例32，一名维多利亚初级学院教师，他最近没有到中国旅行的历史，也与之前的病例没有已知联系。\n专家说，虽然发现这些主要病例有助于当局通过接触者追踪发现新病例，但他们也强调，关于Covid-19的情况如何在社区蔓延，还有更多的未知因素。\n但在过去的一周里，没有新的病例群出现，原发病例减少。例外情况是最近发现的病例82，一名57岁的新加坡人感染了登革热和Covid-19，病例85，一名35岁的中国公民，最近没有到中国旅行。\n由于这些病例只是最近才得到确认，因此在以后进行更详细的接触追踪时可以建立联系。\n在评论过去一周初审案件减少的趋势时，潘基斯托教授说，他希望这将有助于平息公众情绪。\n虽然这也可能意味着潜在的原发病例仍被隐藏在视线之外，但由于新加坡政府在接触追踪方面一直“非常警惕”，因此可能性不大。这一趋势表明，已对感染者进行了有效的检测、隔离和治疗。\n“这是这些流行病的本质——随着公共卫生措施的启动，病毒从易感宿主身上消失，它们开始爆炸，然后失去动力。”\n梁振英博士指出，随着新加坡扩大病例定义，对所有肺炎患者进行Covid-19筛查，病例不太可能落入关注范围。\n但他说，新加坡在接触追踪方面的优势仍将受到患者回忆曾经去过的地方和与谁互动的能力的限制，这可能会解释那些没有已知联系的病例。\n“糟糕的回忆意味着糟糕的接触追踪，导致糟糕的缩减. 我们需要跳出框框思考，”梁振英博士说，他建议未来应该有一个手机应用程序，能够帮助新加坡建立联系追踪的能力。\n大部分早期病例已出院\n专家们还指出，在疫情爆发前两周发现的病例中，大多数已经出院，这一趋势与其他国家的经验类似。这种高放电率也是新加坡Covid-19状况正在改善的一个迹象。\n截至上周五，86例患者中有47例已完全痊愈出院。目前情况危急的病例有5例也有所下降。\n出院病例数不包括Covid-19名患者，他们在感染过程中没有任何症状，但仍在住院治疗。\n许教授指出，在这方面，中国和其他国家公布的数据是相似的。\n“对80%以上的患者来说，Covid-19感染是轻微的，这意味着这些患者不需要仅仅根据医疗需要住院治疗。这些病人在医院被隔离，以尽量减少他们将病毒传播给社区其他人的风险。”。\n虽然在新加坡和其他地方还没有这种疾病的已知疫苗，但Covid-19患者接受的是通常用于艾滋病毒病例的抗病毒药物的混合治疗，如利托那韦和洛匹那韦。卫生部首席卫生科学家谭卓川教授此前表示，这些都是有希望的。\n除了新加坡越来越擅长治疗Covid-19外，该病毒也有可能变得更温和，这可以解释为什么新的病例没有那么严重，Leong博士说。\n在中国的病例中，Covid-19的死亡率约为2.3%。相比之下，Sars的死亡率为92003年爆发期间为0.6%，而中东呼吸综合征（Mers）的死亡率为35%。\n中国境外的Covid-19的死亡率——基于少量死亡人数——仍然较低，约为0.2%，与猪流感相似，略高于季节性流感。\n潘杰斯托教授补充道：“这意味着什么？它仅仅证明了Covid-19的大多数病例并不严重，人们不应该过分担心。就像流感和兹卡一样。”\n大多数与中国无关的案件\n不过，专家们表示，最近几周出现了一个令人担忧的统计数字：无法追溯到中国大陆的病例已经超过了与中国有已知联系的病例。\n梁振英博士说，虽然这不值得惊慌，但事实上，大多数病例与中国没有任何联系，这表明新加坡已经非常接近失去控制从中国传播的病毒的能力。\n他说，强烈的接触追踪有助于控制这些数字，否则未知案件将继续增加。\n“第一轮感染来自中国。第二轮来自与中国人接触的当地人。这在任何正在流行的疾病中都是意料之中的。对第二组保持警惕是至关重要的，我们似乎已经做到了。\n但专家们认为，考虑到针对中国的旅游限制越来越多，可能会有更为隐蔽的事情发生。越来越多的人担心未被发现的Covid-19病例可能从其他国家进入新加坡。\n梁振英博士说：“在中国，这一数字正在下降，很好，病毒在源头（国家）的传播得到控制。但更重要的问题是，那些离开中国，播种到资源较少的国家的人，他们能承受住压力吗？”\nCovid-19例境外病例呈加速增长趋势. 自2月7日以来，中国境外发现的新病例数量稳步攀升，并于2月17日首次突破每日新增100例的门槛，此后一直居高不下。\n虽然在新加坡实施边境管制措施后，Covid-19在新加坡的进口病例数量微不足道，但库克教授预测，随着越来越多的从其他国家进口的病例在新加坡催生更多的集群，这一数字可能会再次攀升。\n他说：“正常情况下，来往新加坡和日本、泰国等地的旅行很多，这两个地方都有相当多的确诊病例。”。\n考虑到新加坡与马来西亚和印度尼西亚的距离和联系，库克副教授表示，他也担心未来从这两个国家进口的风险。印度尼西亚未发现任何Covid-19病例，不过哈佛大学的一项研究质疑这是否是由于其缺乏检测，而不是病毒的发病率。\n库克副教授说：“随着越来越多的病例在中国以外被观察到，现在庆祝还为时过早。”。\n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SIHANOUKVILLE (Cambodia) — Health authorities scrambled on Monday (Feb 17) to track hundreds of passengers who disembarked from a cruise ship in Cambodia last week after a woman tested positive for coronavirus, heightening fears about the spread of the disease around the world. \n The new case raises questions about how companies and countries should handle monitoring and quarantine for people who may have been exposed to the new virus, since the American woman from the Westerdam cruise ship had passed the usually presumed incubation period of 14 days. \n Holland America Line, which is owned by cruise giant Carnival Corp, said it is working with governments and health experts to track passengers. \n \"Guests who have already returned home will be contacted by their local health department and be provided further information,\" the company said in a statement. \n Nearly 200 passengers from the Westerdam have returned to their home countries after travelling through Malaysia and Thailand, authorities said, though none of them displayed any symptoms. \n Some 1,455 passengers and 802 crew first embarked on the cruise. It spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand even though the ship said there were no coronavirus cases aboard. \n In Cambodia, at least 236 passengers and 747 crew remain aboard the vessel off the port city of Sihanoukville, Holland America said. \n Several hundred other Westerdam passengers who left the ship are still in hotels in Cambodia and are being tested on Monday for coronavirus, according to passenger Holley Rauen, a public health nurse and midwife from Fort Myers, Florida. \n “Everyone is very nervous about results,” Ms Rauen said in a message to Reuters. “Some are grouchy but many still remain positive.\" \n ASYMPTOMATIC RISK \n It was not immediately clear how the American woman contracted the virus, but the positive test in Malaysia came after she had spent more than 14 days on the Westerdam, which departed from Hong Kong on Feb. 1. \n Passengers had been cleared to travel by Cambodian authorities when the cruise ship docked on Thursday. The company said passengers were tested regularly on board and Cambodia also tested 20 people once it docked, but not the woman who contracted the virus. \n Ms Raina MacIntyre, head of the Biosecurity Research Program at Australia's University of New South Wales, said it was well known the coronavirus can be infectious even if a patient has no symptoms. \n \"The Japanese tested over 500 of their first evacuees from Wuhan, whether they were symptomatic or not, and five out of eight positive tests were in asymptomatic people,\" Ms MacIntyre said. \"So, in a high risk setting, it would be important to check for infection in everyone.\" \n Holland America said it is working with health officials in Malaysia and Cambodia and experts in the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). \n Worries about the new virus have mounted even though it is believed to kill only around 1 per cent of people it infects, because of fears that with no natural immunity among the world's population, it could spread to infect millions if unchecked. \n The websites of both the CDC and WHO give an estimated incubation period for the virus of up to 14 days. \n Mr Adam Kamradt-Scott, infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, said a Chinese study of 1,099 patients indicated the incubation period could be as much as 24 days, but most people exhibited symptoms within three days. \n Anyone potentially exposed to the virus should self-isolate and notify health authorities if they start to exhibit symptoms, he said. \n \"We need people to be willing to come forward and not fear persecution or discrimination, as that will only serve to aid the virus’ spread.\" \n In Japan, another Carnival cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, has been quarantined since arriving in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, on Feb 3. As of Sunday, 355 people aboard have tested positive — by far the biggest cluster of cases outside China.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Tired and hungry after a long day at work, Mr Derrick Tay was looking forward to returning home for a warm shower, having something to eat and watching Netflix in bed.  \n But something caught his attention while he was mindlessly thumbing through his phone in the train around 9pm on Friday a week ago: Images of shoppers making a mad dash for groceries at supermarkets across the island.  \n While Singaporeans have earned a reputation for being kiasu (Hokkien for the fear of missing out), it was a scene that no one has witnessed here before — not even during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2003 or the H1N1 pandemic in 2009.  \n Just hours earlier, the Ministry of Health (MOH) had raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) risk assessment level from Yellow to Orange. \n The Dorscon level was raised after several Covid-19 cases were detected in the Republic without any links to previous cases or travel histories to China.  \n “I was shocked by what I saw on my phone. When I got home, I told my parents about it,” Mr Tay, 31, said. \n His mother had planned to do her weekly grocery run on Saturday but he told her to do it that night as he “wasn’t sure if there would be anything left for her to buy in the morning at the rate people were wiping out the shelves”.   \n  Customers at Fairprice Finest in Bukit Timah Plaza on Feb 7, 2020, after the Dorscon alert level was changed to Orange. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n The mother and son then headed to their neighbourhood’s mini-mart in Choa Chu Kang.  \n “It was crazy that day. I’ve never seen so many people inside before, and at such a late hour. There was a queue that wound around the inside of the store,” said Mr Tay, who ended up having to wait for more than 30 minutes to pay for his purchases.  \n His basket of groceries held a bag of rice, four packs of assorted instant noodle flavours, a bottle of oil and several cans of tuna and sardine. \n His 72-year-old mother, who helped carry two bags’ worth of toilet paper, told him that she could not remember Singaporeans panicking like this. \n Despite reassurances from government leaders including Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing who took to Facebook to call for calm, Mr Tay and many Singaporeans were not entirely assured as the panic buying continued through the night. \n In fact, Mr Tay was still in the queue when he read Mr Chan’s Facebook post but he went on to complete his purchases.  \n He told TODAY that his actions were partly shaped by the mask situation. The Government had made clear that it has a stockpile of masks but this did not prevent long queues or stocks running out at shops and pharmacies.    \n What happened was that the Government had released five million masks to retailers over nine days last month but these were sold out within hours. As a result, the Government decided to distribute the masks from its stockpile directly to families, capped at four masks per household. At the same time, it has reiterated that there is no need for people to wear a mask if they are well and it is more important to practise good personal hygiene such as washing hands.  \n Singapore, like many countries, has been grappling with a mask shortage since the health crisis started, sparked by a sudden surge in demand. \n  The Government has distributed masks from its stockpile directly to families, capped at four masks per household. Photo: Najeer Yusof/TODAY \n While many like Mr Tay understood the constraints and logistical challenges involved, as far as they are concerned, the takeaway was that they had great difficulty getting masks from retailers and ultimately, had to rely on a limited number given out by the Government.  \n And even if supplies are in no danger of running out, Mr Tay argued that it would not hurt to be prepared.  \n “Anyway, if there’s no emergency, we’ll just take it as having done a few days’ worth of shopping beforehand,” he said.  \n While Mr Tay and his mother had joined the hordes of shoppers at the supermarkets, their purchase was relatively measured compared to the others: Pictures of shoppers with overflowing trolleys went viral, along with photographs and videos of empty vegetable and fruit baskets, and chillers devoid of meat.    \n Still, some like Dr Paul Tambyah felt it was understandable why these shoppers behaved the way they did.  \n Noting that Singapore, along with the rest of the world, would have to deal with the outbreak for the next several months, Dr Tambyah – who is president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection – noted that in such a situation, it was practical to keep some essential supplies on standby in case one has to be put on quarantine, for instance.   \n “As far as I know, when a quarantine officer comes to put a person on quarantine, they do not let you go shopping at the supermarket first,” he said. \n To allay public anxiety, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made a speech a day after the panic buying, assuring Singaporeans that there was no need to panic as the city was not being locked down, and there was ample supply of food for everyone.  \n Now that a sense of normalcy has returned, questions remain to be answered: What caused all that panic-buying over that fateful weekend, which had left some quarters fuming — and embarrassed — over the behaviour of “ugly Singaporeans”, and others to question whatever happened to decades of efforts aimed at building a resilient society? \n And what does it say about Singaporeans, many of whom have stoically and quietly got on with their lives, despite the uncertainty and disruptions to daily life?   \n THE SITUATION ELSEWHERE \n As of Friday, Singapore has 67 confirmed cases of Covid-19 — the highest outside of China where the vast majority of cases are concentrated.  \n Including Hong Kong and Macau, China has reported almost 64,000 cases to date and the count continues to rise.  \n So far, apart from Singapore, there have been no reports of panic buying in places outside of China.  Residents in Thailand for example, which has 33 confirmed cases as of Friday, told TODAY that the situation was calm and there has been no run on daily essentials.  \n Some experts believe that events in Hong Kong, which was gripped by scenes of panic buying recently, had influenced Singaporeans’ behaviour.  \n Speaking to TODAY, Mr Wong Bai Chun, a Hong Kong citizen, said that two weeks ago, there was a brief but acute shortage of toilet paper and other paper goods in the territory, which was sparked by an Internet rumour that the Chinese spring holiday was being extended and there would be insufficient supplies of such products. \n Mr Wong said the fear over paper shortage had spread to other goods in Hong Kong. “Now you can’t find rice anywhere,” said the 26-year-old who works in the finance industry. \n Unlike Macau or mainland China, there are no regulations in Hong Kong to curb such behaviours, he added. \n He said the panic buying and hoarding of daily essentials in Hong Kong stemmed from the shortage of disposable masks.  \n “At the moment, people are sourcing their masks from all over the world and there’s simply not enough,” he said. “Hong Kong doesn’t have the capacity to manufacture sufficient amounts of them.”     Mr Wong Bai Chun, a Hong Kong citizen, told TODAY that the city folks started hoarding long before Singaporeans did. He said it all started with the shortage of disposable masks. Photo: Reuters \n While the panic-buying in Hong Kong mirrors what happened in Singapore, the similarity ends there. \n For one, there is no risk of Singapore running short of essential food and household items like toilet paper from short-term disruptions, such as the Covid-19 outbreak, said Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli. \n The country has managed to be resilient due to astute planning by the nation’s food agencies and its well-connected transport network, he said on Feb 10 during the launch of the 2020 Singapore Food Story. The food security strategy aims to meet 30 per cent of the country’s nutritional needs by 2030 using less than 1 per cent of its land area.  \n On the evening of the panic buying in Singapore, Mr Seah Kian Peng, who is the chief executive of supermarket cooperative NTUC Fairprice, also assured the public that there were sufficient supplies of daily essentials in the warehouse.  \n However, as experts pointed out, rationality and logic get cast aside when panic sets in. \n “Research suggests that when people are in panic, the thinking part of our brain gets hijacked by the emotional system and we start to act illogically,” said a spokesperson for the Singapore Psychological Society (SPS) council. “Our ability to decide on our own is minimised.” \n OTHER TRIGGERS \n Among the possible factors behind the panic buying was negativity bias where people’s brains tend to focus more on negative information than positive ones, said the SPS spokesperson. \n “Our brains are hardwired to register negative stimuli more readily and also to dwell and worry on them for a longer period of time,” the spokesperson told TODAY. \n Furthermore, whenever there is a life-threatening epidemic or emergency, the notions of safety, protection, and self-preservation usually come into play.  \n The spokesperson also noted people also tend to follow others in the hope that the latter could get them out of a dangerous situation.  \n In Singapore’s case, this could be a possible reason why people started to hoard or buy things impulsively if everyone else around them was doing the same, or if they were told to do so on social media platforms. \n This phenomenon of groupthink results in irrational and dysfunctional thinking and outcomes.  \n “In this case, our brains focus more on the fear generated rather than on the reassurance given,” said the spokesperson.  \n Mr Lars Voedisch, the managing director of public relations firm PRecious Communications, said that such behaviour is triggered by one or two initial incidents which then get amplified by social media. \n “(This leads) to a snowball effect of more and more people thinking of it, then hearing from the first people acting on their fear, sharing about it and through that fuelling the whole panic,” he said. \n The images of empty shelves circulating on social media played a big part, said Singapore Management University sociologist Paulin Straughan.   “This meant that people were no longer reacting to rumours that essentials might run out, but this new development itself,” she said. “Which is: The shelves are empty. Better start to go now.”    \n  Shoppers at Fairprice Finest in Bukit Timah Plaza reaching out for toilet paper even before it got stocked in the shelves. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n Professor Straughan, whose research interests include medical sociology that encompasses infectious diseases, said it did not help that the public was seeing these images circulated on social media late in the night. As a result, these became the abiding images for many Singaporeans overnight.  \n “For the next 12 hours, the shelves remain empty (in their minds),” she said. “And that’s 12 hours of festering, and it entrenches (the fear that there are no supplies).” \n Agreeing with Mr Voedisch’s observation about social media, Prof Straughan reiterated that while technology has helped to disseminate information a lot faster, it has similarly allowed misinformation to spread just as quickly as well. \n This was not something that Singaporeans had to worry about during the past virus outbreaks, she added. \n The SPS council spokesperson noted that when the Covid-19 virus was first made known, there was an overwhelming amount of news and social media coverage. \n “When the Dorscon Orange was finally announced, it became a trigger tantamount to saying ‘the coronavirus has arrived’, resulting in the accompanying hoarding behaviour as response,” the spokesperson said.  \n Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Professor May Oo Lwin, whose research interest at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI) includes strategic and health communications, said it is likely that the public was responding to certain levels of fear and stress that the deluge of messages had aroused.   \n She explained that scientists have pointed to a phenomenon where communication leading to fear and stressful emotions can cause unintended consequences.   \n Such messages, she said, needed to be concurrently countered with provision of strategies for coping with perceived threats.   \n “In this particular case, all the media information is likely to have induced strong emotive elements which were managed by some population segments by embracing these forms of rational or irrational, but culturally symbolic, behaviours,” said Prof Lwin. \n In other words, some segments of the population “may undertake actions based around daily priorities to respond to their perceptions of the threat”, said the health communications expert. For example, in extreme cases of crisis like an earthquake, people could be seen taking their television sets while evacuating, she noted.  \n That could explain why stacks of toilet paper were snapped up by Singaporeans during the panic buying. Prof Straughan had another theory: They were relatively cheap and easy to hoard. “We all want to do something to make ourselves feel better,” she quipped. \n PUBLIC COMMS ‘COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER’  \n Communications experts told TODAY that the panic-buying in Singapore might have been avoided if the information disseminated by the authorities had been clearer.  \n “The problem with the message was that it was too bureaucratic at the start,” said Assistant Professor Liew Kai Khiun, who teaches at NTU's WKWSCI. “Much of the Government’s message involved military terms (and) colour codes.\" \n Prof Straughan agreed, noting that the definition of Dorscon Orange was not explained enough as well. \n Dorscon is a colour-coded framework that shows the current disease situation.  \n Orange refers to a situation in which a virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. Previously, the risk assessment level was at Yellow, signifying that the virus was severe and could infect from person to person, but was chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The highest level, Red, indicates that the virus is spreading widely and can result in major disruption such as closing schools. \n “Some people didn’t know what it meant. All they saw was the visual,” said Prof Straughan. “There are four levels. Green, Yellow, Orange and Red. Red is bad, everybody knows that right? Green is good. Now Orange. It is closer to Red than it is to Green. So visually, it lights up all your flags.”  \n Asst Prof Liew pointed out while the message from the authorities was accurate, it did not cater to the layman. To that end, they could have used dialect or Singlish to reach out more effectively, he noted.  \n During the Sars outbreak in 2003, local sitcom character Phua Chu Kang was used to educate Singaporeans on the importance of washing their hands.  This, he said, was an effective way of reaching out to the public, and many people still remember it today. \n A leaked MOH press release a few hours before the official Dorscon Orange announcement, which left many befuddled, might have also fuelled the public panic.  \n The press release was circulated on social media and through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp. \n Up till this incident, Prof Straughan felt that the Government had been doing well in being upfront with Singaporeans about the virus situation. But when the press release was prematurely leaked out, it created some confusion.  \n She said it did not help that recipients of the leaked document were initially told by others that it was fake news, only to be informed by the authorities a few hours later that it was indeed true.   \n Such contradictory information would have led some to question if the authorities were trying to hide something, she said.  \n The authorities have yet to announce the source of the leak, but Trade and Industry Minister Chan said on Feb 9 that the various agencies involved in tackling the virus will remind their staff that they have a professional responsibility not to prematurely share information that has not been finalised. \n Despite these short-comings in public communications, some experts felt that Prime Minister Lee’s nine-minute long speech on Feb 8 went some way in restoring a sense of normalcy. \n The SPS council spokesperson said Mr Lee’s message gave people very concrete actions that “handed back a measure of control to people whose sense of control felt threatened”. \n Mr Voedisch of PRecious Communications said having the Prime Minister step in to address the public helped, because it went beyond technocratic statements and directly addressed what people were concerned with. \n “While authorities should not get emotional when communicating, they have to be empathetic appealing to the hearts and minds of the audience,” said Mr Voedisch. \n However, he was uncertain if an address by Mr Lee to the public at an earlier juncture would have helped.  \n Instead, he said that the authorities should have foreseen the responses from the public as part of proper scenario planning with “ready-to-go action plans”. \n Also, they should have anticipated and addressed the public’s concerns and fears across the different platforms, he added.  \n THE RAMIFICATIONS  \n Mr Chan, the Trade and Industry Minister, had spoken out against panic buying and hoarding behaviour by a “small segment of Singaporeans”, even though he noted that this was to be expected.  \n In a Facebook post on Feb 8, he noted that it was “natural” in times of uncertainty that people want to protect themselves and the ones that they love.  \n “However I urge all of us to think of the larger communities we belong to. Hoarding means that we deprive others of things that they really need,” he said. “That could be your neighbour who needs to buy rice for her children’s meals or even organisations looking after the vulnerable who require cleaning supplies.” \n Speaking to the media the next day, Mr Chan also said that the panic buying at supermarkets will signal to other countries that Singaporeans cannot react well in times of crisis and could be taken advantage of in the future. \n One potential consequence, he warned, is that suppliers and retailers who observe the panic buying might take advantage of the situation and jack up prices of goods. \n Ultimately, the hoarding behaviour was “a fight-or-flight response that has arisen primarily from fear and a need for self-preservation”, said the SPS council spokesperson. \n And this fear can breed distrust and hostility towards others. “With a constant overemphasis on fear, people may start to behave in less caring or more complacent ways in order to maintain self-preservation,” the spokesperson added.   \n HERE COMES THE GOOD \n Still, despite the panic buying grabbing the headlines, Mr Chan and other government leaders took pains to point out that a large majority of Singaporeans had been “calm and rational”.  \n Many Singaporeans had come forward to thank the cashiers and supermarket staff constantly working behind the scenes to restock the empty shelves, Mr Chan noted.   \n Countless others have also stepped in to do their part for their fellow citizens, with numerous ground-up initiatives started in the community. \n For example, TODAY had reported about two primary school girls who used their pocket money to buy and deliver breakfast to doctors and nurses. On Valentine’s Day which fell on Friday, community group StandUpForSG also gave out “love letters” to frontline healthcare workers. \n  \n (From left) Sisters Ruirui and Rui'en delivering breakfast to a healthcare worker on Feb 8, 2020. Photo: Tong Yee/ Facebook \n QUIET RESILIENCE  \n Away from the public spotlight and media glare, ordinary Singaporeans have got on with their lives, despite the disruptions and worries brought on by the Covid-19 outbreak.  \n Scores of Singaporeans — such as taxi and private-hire drivers, as well as those in the retail and tourism industries — have seen their livelihoods take a hit. Others have had to adjust to working from home as business continuity plans swung into place. \n Cleaners, for example, are putting in longer hours while healthcare workers not only have to work longer each day but are also putting themselves at risk on the frontlines.     \n A 23-year-old outbreak nurse who works with Covid-19 patients said that while her family understands the risks of her occupation, it does not stop them from worrying.  \n “Most nurses are worried too, but it’s our job and this is what we do for a living,” said the nurse, who wanted to be known only as Sharmaine due to the sensitivity of her role. \n When she was first assigned to handle suspected Covid-19 cases, Sharmaine said she was scared as no one knew what exactly they were dealing with.  \n “But over time, I grew immune to it, even if a patient were to test positive for the virus. Now I don't feel so scared anymore.” \n However, she feels disappointed at the discrimination against healthcare workers shown by some Singaporeans, even as many others expressed gratitude for their work.  “It truly is demoralising when you hear of such incidents. We feel ostracised at times because all we want to do is perform our job and go home,” she said. “But we continue to keep an open mind because we are the first line of defence.” \n  \n Messages from the public thanking healthcare workers for their hard work. These messages were put up on Facebook with the hashtag #braveheartsg, in response to the initiative by community group StandUpForSG. Photo: Facebook/Muru Nagaraju, Jocelyn Chng, JJ Huang, Dawn Yip \n A taxi driver, who wanted to be known as Mr Ahmad, said he is not scared and has no qualms about picking up healthcare workers.   \n Although his wife worries for him, as there is no way of knowing whether a passenger might be infected with the virus, the 56-year-old CityCab driver said he still has to continue driving to support his family.   \n The virus outbreak, he added, had drastically affected his earnings lately, though he declined to reveal by how much. \n “So far, even my friends (who are also taxi drivers) have all been continuing to work as per normal,” said Mr Ahmad.  \n The only difference is that he has taken some precautions, such as winding down the windows to air his vehicle after dropping off each passenger and disinfecting his steering wheel with Dettol, he added.  \n For 37-year-old father Lucas Chiam, he sought to turn the situation around by using it as an opportunity to spend more time with his two sons, aged six and four. \n Due to Covid-19, the lecturer and his wife decided to limit their children’s outings to the parks and playgrounds, where they would typically just keep an eye out for the youngsters’ safety. \n Instead, they introduced the boys to home-based activities which could involve the entire family, such as arts and craft, reading and even playing Xbox console games.  \n “I think the best we can do right now is to stay positive. This is an opportunity to bond with the kids, work on some home improvement tasks and plan for the year ahead,” Mr Chiam said.  \n “Maybe through these tough times, we can develop some new good habits for the family that will stay with us even after the threat is over.” \n Some businesses have had to adjust their operating models due to the outbreak. \n Ms Jazz Chong, the owner and director of contemporary gallery Ode To Art, has noticed fewer people visiting the gallery as well as the Raffles City Shopping Centre, where the gallery is located.   \n “With the virus outbreak becoming more severe, we have now decided to take the extra measure of bringing the art to our clients directly,” she said. “If they like the work then it can remain in their home, making it extra convenient for them as they do not even have to leave their house.” \n Meanwhile, curtain maker and supplier MC2 held its first Facebook Live event on Feb 11. \n Mr Wilson Chew, the founder and managing director of the company, said: “During this time of crisis when people may be worried about attending events with crowds, we thought of using Facebook Live.” \n By broadcasting live on the social media platform, customers were given the chance to ask questions and interact with the company’s salesperson in real time as he gave demonstrations of the company’s various zip-blind products.  \n Business owners like Ms Chong and Mr Chew are hoping that people would continue life as normal, albeit taking the necessary precautions.  \n Or as NTU’s Asst Prof Liew put it: “We must have a courageous sense of normality and go on living life normally.”  \n Indeed, Prime Minister Lee noted on Friday that the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to last longer than Sars, with a greater impact already hitting the economy.   But he stressed: “We have to keep Singapore going and we have to keep making a living. Life has to go on.”     \n   \n   \n ",

Nadarajan/今天\n随后，母子俩前往位于蔡楚康附近的小超市\n“那天太疯狂了。我从来没见过这么多人在里面，而且在这么晚的时候。泰伊先生说，商店里排起了长队，“他最后不得不等30多分钟才付款。”. \n他的菜篮子里装着一袋米饭、四包什锦方便面、一瓶油和几罐金枪鱼和沙丁鱼。\n他72岁的母亲帮他搬了两袋卫生纸，她告诉他，她不记得新加坡人这样惊慌失措。\n尽管贸易和工业部长陈振成（Chan Chun Sing）等政府领导人在Facebook上呼吁民众保持冷静，但由于恐慌性买盘持续了一整夜，泰和许多新加坡人并没有完全放心。\n事实上，戴耀廷在Facebook上看到陈水扁的帖子时，仍在排队，但他继续完成了购买\n他今天说，他的行为在一定程度上是受面具的影响。政府已经明确表示，它有一个口罩库存，但这并不能防止在商店和药店排长队或库存耗尽\n发生的事情是，政府在上个月的9天里向零售商发放了500万个口罩，但几小时内就售罄。因此，政府决定将库存中的口罩直接分发给家庭，每户最多4个口罩。同时，它重申，如果人们身体健康，就没有必要戴口罩，更重要的是要保持良好的个人卫生，如洗手\n新加坡和许多国家一样，自卫生危机爆发以来，由于需求突然激增，一直在努力解决口罩短缺问题。\n政府已将库存的口罩直接分发给家庭，每户最多4个口罩。图片来源：Najeer Yusof/今天\n尽管像泰先生这样的许多人都理解其中的限制和后勤挑战，但他们的收获是，他们很难从零售商那里买到面具，最终不得不依靠政府提供的有限数量的面具. \n而且，即使供应不存在耗尽的危险，泰先生认为做好准备也不会有什么坏处\n他说：“不管怎样，如果没有紧急情况，我们会认为这是提前几天购物的结果。”\n虽然泰先生和他的母亲加入了超市的购物者大军，但他们的购买量与其他人相比是相对衡量的：手推车满溢的购物者照片、空蔬菜和水果篮的照片和视频以及没有肉的冷冻机在网上疯传\n尽管如此，一些像Paul Tambyah博士这样的人认为，这些购物者的行为方式是可以理解的\n注意到新加坡和世界其他地区将不得不在未来几个月内应对疫情，亚太临床微生物学和感染学会主席Tambyah博士指出，在这种情况下，例如，在需要隔离的情况下，保持一些必需品的备用是可行的\n他说：“据我所知，当检疫人员来对一个人实施检疫时，他们不会让你先去超市购物。\n为了缓解公众的焦虑，李显龙总理在恐慌性购买一天后发表讲话，向新加坡人保证没有必要恐慌，因为这座城市没有被封锁，每个人都有充足的食物供应. \n现在，一种正常的感觉又回来了，问题仍然没有答案：是什么导致了在那个灾难性的周末发生的所有恐慌性购买，这让一些人对“丑陋的新加坡人”的行为感到愤怒和尴尬，还有人质疑几十年来旨在建设一个有弹性的社会的努力究竟发生了什么？\n对于新加坡人来说，他们中的许多人尽管日常生活充满不确定性和混乱，但他们的生活还是坚忍而平静地继续着？  \n别处的情况\n截至上周五，新加坡共有67例Covid-19确诊病例，是中国以外绝大多数病例集中的国家中最高的\n包括香港和澳门在内，中国迄今报告了近64000起案件，而且人数还在继续上升。\n到目前为止，除了新加坡，中国以外的地方还没有出现恐慌性购买的报道。例如，泰国的居民在周五已经确诊了33例，他们今天说，局势很平静，日常生活必需品也没有短缺\n一些专家认为，最近被恐慌抢购的场面影响了香港的事件，影响了新加坡人的行为。\n今天，一位香港市民Wong Bai Chun先生说，两周前，该地区的卫生纸和其他纸制品出现了短暂而严重的短缺，这是由网络传言引发的，即中国春假正在延长，这样的产品供应不足。\nWong表示，对纸张短缺的担忧已经蔓延到香港的其他商品。“现在你在任何地方都找不到大米，”这位在金融业工作的26岁女孩说。\n他补充道，与澳门或中国大陆不同，香港没有限制此类行为的规定。\n他说，香港日常用品的恐慌性购买和囤积源于一次性口罩的短缺。. \n他说：“目前，人们正从世界各地采购口罩，但数量远远不够。“香港没有能力制造足够的水果挞。”香港市民胡伯春先生今天告诉记者，城市居民在新加坡人之前就开始囤积。他说，这一切都是从一次性口罩短缺开始的。图片来源：路透社\n虽然香港的恐慌性购买反映了新加坡发生的事情，但相似性就此结束。\n新加坡环境和水资源部长祖尔基菲（Masagos Zulkifli）表示，一方面，短期内如Covid-19爆发，新加坡基本食品和厕纸等生活用品不会出现短缺的风险。\n他2月10日在《2020新加坡美食故事》的发布会上说，由于国家食品机构和交通网络的精心规划，新加坡已经成功地恢复了活力。粮食安全战略的目标是，到2030年，利用不到1%的土地面积，满足该国30%的营养需求\n新加坡发生抢购事件的当晚，超市合作社NTUC Fairprice的首席执行官肖建鹏也向公众保证，仓库里的日常必需品供应充足\n然而，正如专家所指出的，当恐慌来临时，理性和逻辑被抛弃。\n新加坡心理学会（SPS）理事会的一位发言人说：“研究表明，当人们处于恐慌状态时，大脑的思维部分会被情绪系统劫持，我们开始采取不合逻辑的行为。”。“我们自己决定的能力被最小化了。”\n其他触发器\nSPS发言人说，恐慌性购买背后的可能因素包括消极偏见，即人们的大脑倾向于更多地关注消极信息而不是积极信息.\n这位发言人今天说：“我们的大脑是天生的，能够更容易地记录负面刺激，也能长时间地沉湎于这些刺激中，并为之担忧。”。\n此外，每当出现危及生命的流行病或紧急情况时，安全、保护和自我保护的观念通常会发挥作用\n这位发言人还指出，人们也倾向于跟随他人，希望后者能让他们走出危险境地\n以新加坡为例，这可能是人们开始冲动囤积或购买东西的一个可能原因，如果他们周围的其他人都在做同样的事情，或者如果他们被告知要在社交媒体平台上这样做。\n这种群体思维现象会导致非理性和功能失调的思维和结果\n发言人说：“在这种情况下，我们的大脑更多地关注产生的恐惧，而不是给予的安慰。”\n公关公司Price Communications的董事总经理拉尔斯•沃迪希（Lars Voedisch）表示，这种行为是由最初的一两起事件引发的，这些事件随后被社交媒体放大。\n他说：“这导致越来越多的人想到了雪球效应，然后听到了第一批人对他们的恐惧采取行动，分享了他们的恐惧，并由此引发了整个恐慌。”。\n新加坡管理大学（Singapore Management University）社会学家保林•斯特劳恩（Paulin Straughan）表示，在社交媒体上流传的空架子形象起了很大作用。她说：“这意味着人们不再对必需品可能耗尽的传言作出反应，而是对这一新发展本身作出反应。”。“也就是说：架子是空的。最好现在就出发。”\n在Bukit Timah Plaza的Fairprice Finest购物中心，甚至在厕纸上架之前，顾客就已经伸手去拿了. 照片：Raj Nadarajan/今天\nStraughan教授的研究兴趣包括包含传染病的医学社会学，他说公众在深夜看到这些图片在社交媒体上传播是没有帮助的。因此，这些成为许多新加坡人一夜之间的永恒形象\n她说：“在接下来的12个小时里，货架（在他们的脑海中）都是空的。”。“那是12个小时的溃烂，它使人更加害怕没有补给。”\n斯特拉恩同意沃迪希对社交媒体的看法，他重申，虽然技术有助于更快地传播信息，但同样也让错误信息传播得同样迅速。\n她补充说，在过去的病毒爆发期间，这不是新加坡人必须担心的问题。\nSPS理事会发言人指出，当Covid-19病毒首次被发现时，有大量的新闻和社交媒体报道。\n这位发言人说：“当多尔松橙最终被宣布时，它就成了一个导火索，相当于说‘冠状病毒已经到来了’，导致随之而来的囤积行为作为回应。”\n南洋理工大学（NTU）教授May Oo Lwin在Wee Kim Wee传播与信息学院（WKWSCI）的研究兴趣包括战略与健康传播，他说，公众很可能对大量信息引发的某种程度的恐惧和压力做出了反应\n她解释说，科学家们指出了一种导致恐惧和紧张情绪的交流会导致意想不到的后果的现象\n她说，这些信息需要与提供应对感知到的威胁的策略同时加以应对.  \nLwin教授说：“在这种特殊情况下，所有的媒体信息都可能通过包含这些形式的理性或非理性但具有文化象征意义的行为而产生强烈的情感因素，这些情感因素是由一些人口群体管理的。”。\n换言之，健康传播专家表示，部分人群“可能会根据日常优先事项采取行动，以应对他们对威胁的看法”。她指出，例如，在地震等极端危机情况下，人们可以看到撤离时带着电视机\n这就可以解释为何新加坡民众在恐慌性购买期间抢购了一摞卫生纸，斯特劳恩教授有另一个理论：卫生纸相对便宜，容易囤积。她打趣道：“我们都想做些事情让自己感觉好点。”。\n公共通讯“本可以更好”\n通讯专家今天告诉记者，如果当局发布的信息更加清晰，新加坡的恐慌性购买可能会避免\n“这条信息的问题在于，一开始过于官僚化，”在南大WKWSCI任教的助理教授Liew Kai Khiun说。“政府的大部分信息涉及军事术语（和）色码。”\n斯特劳恩教授对此表示赞同，并指出，对多尔松橙的定义解释得还不够。\nDorscon是一个彩色编码的框架，显示了当前的疾病状况\n橙色是指一种病毒在新加坡传播但不广泛，并且正在被控制的情况。此前，风险评估水平为黄色，表明病毒严重，可人与人之间传染，但主要发生在新加坡以外。最高级别的红色表示病毒正在广泛传播，并可能导致学校关闭等重大干扰。\n“有些人不知道这是什么意思。他们看到的只是视觉，”斯特劳恩教授说. “有四个层次。绿色，黄色，橙色和红色。红色不好，大家都知道是吧？绿色很好。现在是橙色。它比绿色更接近红色。所以视觉上，它会点亮你所有的旗帜。”\n刘副教授指出，虽然当局的消息是准确的，但它并没有迎合外行。他指出，为了达到这个目的，他们本可以用方言或新加坡语更有效地进行接触\n在2003年非典爆发期间，当地的情景喜剧人物Phua Chu Kang被用来教育新加坡人洗手的重要性，他说，这是一种接触公众的有效方式，很多人至今还记得。\n英国卫生部（MOH）在多尔森奥兰治（Dorscon Orange）的官方声明发布前几个小时发布的一份泄露的新闻稿，可能也加剧了公众的恐慌\n新闻稿在社交媒体和WhatsApp等信息平台上传播。\n直到这次事件发生之前，斯特劳恩教授认为，政府一直在与新加坡人就病毒情况进行正面交涉方面做得很好。但当新闻稿被过早地泄露出去时，引起了一些混乱\n她说，泄露文件的接收者最初被其他人告知这是假消息，但几小时后当局才告知这确实是真的，这并没有帮助\n她说，这些相互矛盾的信息会让一些人质疑当局是否试图隐瞒一些事情\n当局尚未公布泄密来源，但工贸易部长陈冯富珍2月9日表示，参与处理病毒的各机构将提醒工作人员，他们有专业责任不过早分享尚未敲定的信息。\n尽管在公共交流中出现了这些短消息，但一些专家认为，李明博总理2月8日长达9分钟的讲话在某种程度上恢复了常态.\nSPS理事会发言人表示，李明博的讲话给了人们非常具体的行动，即“将控制措施交还给那些控制感受到威胁的人”。\n珍贵通讯公司的沃迪希表示，让总理介入向公众发表讲话是有帮助的，因为这超出了技术官僚的说法，直接涉及到人们关心的问题。\n沃迪希表示：“虽然当局在沟通时不应该情绪化，但他们必须有同情心，吸引观众的心灵。”。\n不过，他不确定李明博早些时候向公众发表的讲话是否会有所帮助\n相反，他说，当局应该预见到公众的反应，作为“准备好行动计划”的适当方案规划的一部分。\n他补充说，此外，他们本应预见并解决不同平台上公众的担忧和担忧\n影响\n工商部长陈水扁曾公开表示反对“一小部分新加坡人”的恐慌性购买和囤积行为，尽管他指出这是意料之中的\n在2月8日的一篇Facebook文章中，他指出，在不确定的时刻，人们想要保护自己和他们所爱的人是“自然的”\n“然而，我敦促我们大家考虑我们所属的更大的社区。囤积意味着我们剥夺了他人真正需要的东西。”。“那可能是你的邻居，她需要为孩子们买米饭，甚至是那些需要清洁用品照顾弱势群体的组织。”\n陈冯富珍第二天在接受媒体采访时也表示，超市的恐慌性购买会向其他国家发出信号，即新加坡人在遇到危机时反应不好，未来可能会被利用.\n他警告说，一个潜在的后果是，观察到恐慌性购买的供应商和零售商可能会利用这种情况，抬高商品价格。\nSPS理事会发言人说，最终，囤积居奇的行为是“主要由于恐惧和自我保护的需要而产生的战斗或逃跑反应”。\n这种恐惧会滋生对他人的不信任和敌意。这位发言人还说：“随着对恐惧的不断强调，人们可能会开始表现得不那么关心或是更加自满，以保持自我保护。”\n好的来了\n不过，尽管恐慌性购买占据了新闻头条，陈水扁和其他政府领导人还是不遗余力地指出，绝大多数新加坡人都是“冷静和理性的”\n陈先生指出，许多新加坡人都站出来感谢收银员和超市工作人员不断在幕后工作，为空货架补货\n无数的其他人也加入进来为他们的同胞尽自己的一份力量，在社区里发起了无数的初步行动。\n例如，今天有报道说，有两名小学女生用零花钱购买早餐，并将早餐送到医生和护士手中。在周五的情人节，社区组织StandUpForSG也向一线医护人员发出了“情书”。\n（左起）2020年2月8日，瑞瑞和瑞恩姐妹为一名医护人员送早餐。照片：童怡/脸书\n安静的弹性\n远离公众的聚光灯和媒体的怒视，普通的新加坡人已经开始了他们的生活，尽管Covid-19爆发带来了干扰和担忧\n许多新加坡人，如出租车和私人出租司机，以及零售业和旅游业的人，他们的生计受到了冲击。随着业务连续性计划的实施，其他人不得不适应在家工作.\n例如，清洁工投入的时间更长，而医护人员不仅每天要工作更长时间，而且还将自己置于前线的危险之中\n一位与Covid-19病人一起工作的23岁的暴发护士说，虽然她的家人了解她的职业风险，但这并不能阻止他们担心\n“大多数护士也很担心，但这是我们的工作，这是我们的谋生之道，”这位护士说，由于她角色的敏感性，她只想被称为莎曼。\n当她第一次被指派处理疑似Covid-19病例时，Sharmaine说她很害怕，因为没人知道他们到底在处理什么\n“但随着时间的推移，我对它产生了免疫力，即使病人的病毒检测呈阳性。现在我不再感到害怕了。”\n然而，她对一些新加坡人对医护人员的歧视感到失望，尽管许多新加坡人对他们的工作表示感谢，“当你听到此类事件时，真的很沮丧。我们有时会感到被排斥，因为我们想做的只是完成工作回家。“但我们继续保持开放的心态，因为我们是第一道防线。”\n公众对医护人员辛勤工作表示感谢的信息。为了响应社区组织StandUpForSG的倡议，这些信息被贴在Facebook上，标签是“braveheartsg”。图片来源：Facebook/Muru Nagaraju，Jocelyn Chng，JJ Huang，Dawn Yip\n一位出租车司机，想被称为艾哈迈德先生，他说，他不害怕，并没有任何疑虑接送医护人员\n尽管妻子为他担心，因为无法知道乘客是否感染了病毒，这位56岁的城市交通管理局司机说，他仍然必须继续开车养家\n他补充说，病毒的爆发已经严重影响了他最近的收入，尽管他拒绝透露有多少.\n艾哈迈德表示：“到目前为止，就连我的朋友（也是出租车司机）都在继续正常工作。”\n唯一不同的是，他采取了一些预防措施，比如在让每位乘客下车后，把车窗摇下来给车通风，并用代托消毒方向盘，他补充说\n对于37岁的父亲Lucas Chiam来说，他想利用这个机会来扭转局面，花更多的时间和他6岁和4岁的两个儿子在一起。\n由于Covid-19，演讲者和他的妻子决定限制他们的孩子去公园和操场游玩，在那里他们通常只是注意孩子们的安全。\n相反，他们向孩子们介绍了家庭活动，这些活动可能涉及整个家庭，如艺术和手工艺，阅读，甚至玩Xbox游戏机\n“我认为我们现在能做的就是保持乐观。这是一个与孩子们建立联系、完成一些家庭装修任务并为未来一年做好计划的机会\n“也许通过这些艰难的时期，我们可以为这个家庭培养一些新的好习惯，即使在威胁结束后，这些好习惯也会留在我们身边。”\n由于疫情爆发，一些企业不得不调整经营模式。\nJazz Chong女士是当代画廊艺术颂歌的所有者和导演，她注意到参观画廊以及画廊所在的莱佛士城购物中心的人越来越少\n她说：“随着病毒的爆发变得越来越严重，我们现在决定采取额外措施，将这种艺术直接带给我们的客户。”。“如果他们喜欢这份工作，那么它就可以留在家里，这样对他们来说就更加方便了，因为他们甚至不必离开家。”\n与此同时，窗帘制造商和供应商MC2在2月11日举行了第一次Facebook现场活动.\n该公司创始人兼董事总经理周伟信（Wilson Chew）表示：“在危机期间，当人们可能担心与人群一起出席活动时，我们曾想过使用Facebook Live。”\n通过在社交媒体平台上进行直播，顾客可以在公司销售人员演示公司各种拉链产品时，实时提问并与他们互动\n像钟女士和周先生这样的企业主希望人们能继续正常的生活，尽管他们采取了必要的预防措施\n或者如南洋理工大学副教授刘教授所言：“我们必须有一种勇敢的常态意识，继续过正常的生活。”\n事实上，李明博总理上周五指出，预计Covid-19疫情持续时间将超过Sars，对经济的冲击已经更大。但他强调：“我们必须让新加坡继续发展，我们必须继续谋生。生活必须继续下去。”\n \n ",

Our sign-up page is here. \n  \n Worries over coronavirus infections coming in from abroad seemed of growing concern as imported cases of infections grew and countries considered further travel restrictions.  \n China reported today that while there were no new infections in Wuhan, where the outbreak began, imported cases surged by a record and accounted for all of the new confirmed cases in mainland China. In another move, the port of Fuzhou in eastern China began restricting vessels arriving from nine countries in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus by visiting ships and their crew.  \n The Philippines announced today it is stopping the issuance of visas to foreigners to contain the outbreak. \n Singapore, on Wednesday, announced that all Singaporeans and residents returning to the country will have to serve a 14-day isolation period. This came on a day when the number of new cases spiralled to 47, an all-time high. Of these, 33 cases were imported and of them 30 involved Singapore residents returning from abroad. \n Two days ago, India shut down the Taj Mahal and other popular tourist locations and expanded its travel and visa restrictions to include travellers from the European Union, Turkey and the United Kingdom. In Japan, the revelry was missing as the country's famed cherry blossom season, that usually attracts visitors from around the world, was officially declared as having started on March 14. \n Also read:  \n Airfares soar 174% as Chinese flee Europe    \n What is a stay-home notice, and what should you do if you are affected?  \n New evidence shows young people are falling seriously ill \n  \n China is reaching out to European countries to share its knowledge and expertise on Covid-19. But some observers say this is Beijing's attempt to improve its global standing, at a time when both are not on good terms with the Trump administration.  \n Some European countries are showing appreciation. China's aid and assistance comes at a time of growing concern as Europe becomes the new epicentre of Covid-19.   \n Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump riled China by insisting the virus originated in China and there was nothing wrong in calling it a \"Chinese virus\". And in a surprising turn of events, the adviser to the Hong Kong government said that it was okay to refer to the virus as the \"Wuhan coronavirus\" in a column. But he had to withdraw the article soon after.  \n Read also:  \n Is the US-China relationship near breaking point?

Global Affairs Correspondent Jonathan Eyal shares his view: Covid-19 response shows up Europe's disunity \n  \n Indonesia succeeded in convincing organisers of a large religious gathering in the country's South Sulawesi to cancel the event that was due to begin today.  \n But fears that it could increase the number of coronavirus infections in the country persisted as more than 8,000 people from the region, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere had already arrived in the provincial town of Gowa, near the city of Makassar. Police and local officials were helping them leave the country. \n The event was due to be held just two weeks after a similar event in Malaysia that drew over 16,000 followers but resulted in over 500 infections in Malaysia alone. At least 50 other infections in Brunei, Cambodia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam have also been traced to the Malaysian gathering.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SHANGHAI (BLOOMBERG) - The coronavirus epidemic is accelerating a shake-out in China's property sector as a cash crunch forces distressed developers to throw in the towel. \n With lockdowns across the world's most-populous nation entering their third month, smaller home builders are being pushed to the brink because they can't get enough money from pre-sales of apartments to cover their costs. \n In the first two months of this year, around 105 real estate firms issued bankruptcy filing statements, after almost 500 collapses in 2019, data compiled by Bloomberg show. \n \"A vast number of mid- to small-sized developers will face a choice no one wants to make - either sell their property assets and start another business, or be bought out,\" China Index Holdings Research Director Huang Yu said. \n \"The shake-out is just beginning.\" \n Even before the new coronavirus, China's housing market was under pressure. \n Home prices rose at the slowest pace in almost two years in January and several developers, saddled with debt they're struggling to service, began to dial back on construction. S&P Global Ratings said in a note on Tuesday (March 10) that as Covid-19 spreads, the squeeze may be felt most acutely by Chinese banks and property firms. \n As a result, mergers and acquisitions among the nation's almost 100,000 real estate companies will ramp up again in 2020, Mr Yu said, declining to put a number on the expected deal value. \n \"Declining sales will hurt developers' liquidity, as the proceeds still form the largest and most important funding source,\" S&P credit analyst Christopher Yip said, noting that with construction largely paused, delivery schedules and revenue recognition are being pushed further out. \n \"Several companies already in the CCC category or with low ratings with negative outlooks may face liquidity issues.\" \n New York-based Avenue Capital Group, a firm that trades distressed debt and invests in special situations, said a China home market in flux spells increasingly versatile buying opportunities. It's looking at scooping up soured developer debt and buying troubled real estate projects at a discount. \n \"There'll be more bargains appearing on the market,\" said Wang Yifeng, Avenue Capital's Shanghai-based head of China. \"If you see a distressed seller among the country's top 100 firms, don't be surprised.\" \n Construction Halted According to S&P, new home sales in China will register their first drop in 12 years this year, with transactions down as much as 15 per cent. That's if the virus reaches a turning point this month. If the nadir isn't until April, sales could be down around 20 per cent, akin to the hit taken during the 2008 global financial crisis. \n Fusheng Group is one of the first mid-sized developers to falter. The debt-laden company, based in China's southeastern Fujian province, was in talks to sell a 70 per cent stake to a consortium led by Shimao Property Holdings, people familiar with the matter said in December. \n Local media reported in January that a new joint venture has been established, with Fusheng injecting its jettisoned property projects into the fresh vehicle. Shimao is one of the nation's biggest developers. \n Representatives from Fusheng didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment. \n Cash flows of less competent players have been sliding for years and the virus is only making matters worse, according to Wu Rui, an executive director of non-performing assets at private equity firm CDH Investments Fund Management Co. Asset-management companies are teaming up with top developers and eyeing such businesses, he said. \n In Hubei alone, the epicentre of the virus, there are around 4,300 developers. Home prices in Hubei's provincial city Wuhan rose at one of the fastest paces in the world last year, Knight Frank data show. \n To the north, in central Henan province, the general manager of one small developer said the only target his company had set, in early February, was to make all of its debt repayments over the next six months. \n Another manager at a small developer based in Zhejiang, a province in China's east, said the firm was two months away from bankruptcy. Its four projects under construction are halted because of the virus, he said. \n \"The epidemic could actually be a fresh opportunity for big developers,\" said Liu Ce, who's in charge of growth strategy at another large homebuilder, Shenzhen-based Kaisa Group Holdings. \n \"We can pull many levers to alleviate cash flow stress. Once you live through that, you see the wave of asset offloading by small players as a good chance.\" \n Kaisa became the first, and only, Chinese developer to default on its US dollar debt in April 2015. It went through a huge debt restructure and spent years rebuilding its balance sheet and credit rating. \n Now, it's regained investor confidence; Kaisa has already sold US$1.2 billion (S$1.67 billion) of bonds this year and in January, bought a site in Hong Kong's New Territories for HK$3.5 billion (S$630 million) to expand its foothold in the city. \n But while the likes of Kaisa, Shimao and China Evergrande Group have hundreds of property projects nationwide, the majority of China's developers are small and unlisted, with sometimes just a handful of projects in one city. They're the ones most at risk from the twin forces of coronavirus and a slowing market. \n Smaller developers also typically do not rely on bank loans or bond sales to alleviate funding concerns. Instead, they count on inflows from apartment sales, as well as shadow financing. \n Policymakers have so far refrained from unleashing wholesale monetary stimulus measures for real estate firms, fearing that could result in a surge in home prices. Most support has come from marginal easing by local governments. The central bank reiterated earlier this month that real estate \"definitely\" won't be used to stimulate the economy. \n Shenzhen on Wednesday allowed builders to draw on some cash deposits, which are usually held in reserve by banks during construction to ensure developers don't abandon projects. Still, local officials stressed the current home-buying restrictions won't be loosened. \n Coronavirus may be the \"straw that broke the camel's back for many small builders\", said Xie Yangchun, an analyst at China Real Estate Information Corp. \n \"A new wave of industry consolidation has started.\" \n ",

We wanted to put the government on notice we won't tolerate it for the good of the Chinese people and the world.\" \n United States Defence Department spokesman Alyssa Farah wrote on Twitter last Friday that \"the Communist Party of China has chosen to promulgate false & absurd conspiracy theories about the origin of Covid-19 blaming US service members. #ChinaPropaganda\". \n The Chinese Embassy did not respond to requests for comment. \n Despite the tension, US President Donald Trump last Friday praised Beijing for its \"data sharing\".

How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!\" \n Mr Zhao's comments came days after Mr Robert O'Brien, the US national security adviser, said China had reacted slowly to the coronavirus, probably costing the world two months when it could have been preparing. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also complained that the US response had been hindered by what he called imperfect data from Beijing. \n The coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, hitting financial markets, bringing some flights to a standstill, closing schools and forcing the postponement of many major events. \n REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON (NYTIMES) - In late January, as China locked down some provinces to contain the spread of the coronavirus, average Internet speeds in the country slowed as people who were stuck inside went online more often and clogged the networks. In Hubei province, the epicentre of infections, mobile broadband speeds fell by more than half. \n In mid-February, when the virus hit Italy, Germany and Spain, Internet speeds in those countries also began to deteriorate. \n And last week, as a wave of stay-at-home orders rolled out across the United States, the average time it took to download videos, e-mails and documents increased as broadband speeds declined 4.9 per cent from the previous week, according to Ookla, a broadband speed testing service. Median download speeds dropped 38 per cent in San Jose, California, and 24 per cent in New York, according to Broadband Now, a consumer broadband research site. \n Quarantines around the world have made people more reliant on the Internet to communicate, work, learn and stay entertained. But as the use of YouTube, Netflix, Zoom videoconferencing, Facebook calls and video gaming has surged to new highs, the stress on Internet infrastructure is starting to show in Europe and the US - and the traffic is probably far from its peak. \n \"This is totally unprecedented,\" said Mr Thierry Breton, a European Union commissioner who oversees digital policy and was a chief executive of France Telecom. \"We have to be proactive.\" \n To head off problems, European regulators like Mr Breton have pushed streaming companies such as Netflix and YouTube to reduce the size of their video files so they do not take up as much bandwidth. In the US, regulators have given wireless carriers access to more spectrum to bolster the capacity of their networks. \n Some tech companies have responded to the call to ease Internet traffic. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said this week that it would reduce the quality of its videos from high to standard definition across the globe. Disney delayed the start of its Disney Plus streaming service in France by two weeks, and Microsoft's Xbox asked gaming companies to introduce online updates and new releases only at certain times to prevent network congestion. \n \"We really don't know how long we're going to be in this mode for,\" Mr Dave Temkin, Netflix's vice-president of network and systems infrastructure, said in a webinar on Wednesday (March 25) on how the coronavirus could affect internet infrastructure. \n Internet service providers like Comcast, Vodafone, Verizon and Telefonica have been building out their networks for years to account for increasing demand. But company officials said they had never seen such a steep, sudden surge. \n Growth that the industry had expected to take a year is happening over days, said Mr Enrique Blanco, chief technology officer at Telefonica, a Spanish telecommunications company. \n \"In just two days, we grew all the traffic we had planned for 2020,\" Mr Blanco said. \n On Monday, traffic on AT&T's networks was up 27 per cent compared with the same day last month, and last week Verizon experienced a 22 per cent increase in traffic on its wireless and fibre broadband service. Wi-Fi calls doubled from their normal volume, the carriers said. \n In Europe, Internet traffic into homes over fixed lines was up more than 30 per cent, according to Telefonica. Activities like online gaming and video conferencing have more than doubled, while messages over WhatsApp have more than quadrupled. \n So much traffic and stress on internet networks has slowed the speed of downloading webpages and apps, according to Ookla. \n \"Congestion is higher,\" said Ms Adriane Blum, an Ookla spokesman. \"We're all at home and the activities we're doing in this unprecedented time are not low-bandwidth usage, which means a lot of activity on a network.\" \n Cisco said demand for its WebEx teleconference service had tracked the spread of the coronavirus. Demand first surged in Asia, then in Europe, and last week it soared 240 per cent in the US. \n The demand has pushed up failure rates delivering video conferencing, said Mr Sri Srinivasan, a Cisco senior vice-president in charge of WebEx. \n \"I don't know if we'll soon see a peak, not for weeks to come,\" he said. \"The reason I say that is because we aren't seeing traffic in Asia slow down even now.\" \n Internet service providers said they could handle the deluge of traffic but were adding capacity. Verizon, Cox and AT&T said they were building more cell sites to strengthen mobile networks, increasing the number of fibre connections on their network backbones, and upgrading the routing and switching technology that lets devices talk to one another and share an internet connection. \n Orange, formerly France Telecom, has doubled its capacity inside undersea Internet cables. In Italy, where home Internet use is up 90 per cent, Telecom Italia said its technicians continued to make repairs and add capacity. Vodafone, one of Europe's largest networks operators, said it had increased its capacity 50 per cent in recent weeks through a mix of software and the addition of more equipment in the field. \n \"We're seeing some signs of stress,\" AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson said in an interview on CNN on Sunday. \"We're having to go out and do some augmentation of networks, and so we're sending our employees out there to get that done, but right now the network is performing quite well.\" \n To prevent clogged networks, Europe has taken the most aggressive steps. \n Last week, Mr Breton, discussed reducing the bitstreams of videos with Mr Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; Mr Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google; and Ms Susan Wojcicki, the head of YouTube. The companies agreed, as did Amazon for its Prime Video streaming service and Twitch, its online gaming platform. \n Many of the companies then went further. On Tuesday, Netflix decided to switch its high-definition video streams in India, Australia and Latin America to slightly lower quality to reduce the traffic they create there by 25 per cent, and YouTube said it would make all global streams standard definition. \n \"We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimise stress on the system during this unprecedented situation,\" YouTube said in a statement. \n Microsoft's Xbox gaming business recently asked large gaming companies to release online updates of their games during off-peak hours while it helped focus on the critical Internet needs of people involved in the coronavirus crisis, according to an Xbox email reviewed by The New York Times. Video game updates can require great amounts of bandwidth to download. \n Xbox asked the companies to release updates in a four-hour overnight window in North America, and only from Monday through Thursday. \n \"Microsoft is actively monitoring performance and usage trends to ensure we're optimising service for our customers worldwide, and accommodating new growth and demand,\" the company said. \"At the same time, these are unprecedented times, and we're also taking proactive steps to plan for these high-usage periods.\" \n While US regulators said they did not plan to follow Europe in asking for streaming and social media companies to degrade their services, they are taking other steps. Last week, the Federal Communications Commission granted Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile temporary access to more airwaves. \n \"The FCC has been coordinating closely with network operators to ensure those networks remain up and running,\" Mr Ajit Pai, the agency's chairman, said in a statement. \n Telefonica's Mr Blanco, who has been living under a lockdown in Spain, said he expected the record traffic to last for some time. It may even become the new normal, he said. \n In Spain, Internet use drops only at 8pm, when people across the country go to their windows to cheer health workers and others who are helping to manage the crisis. \n \"Suddenly at 8pm it goes down; then it goes back up,\" Mr Blanco said. \"It's a beautiful thing.\" \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "As coronavirus infections spike across South-east Asia, Myanmar and Laos have conspicuously logged zero patients - despite the fact that both share a sizeable border with China, where the out-break originated. \n Both countries say all the people suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have tested negative so far. But limited access to testing equipment and reagents means that they have conducted only about 300 tests for a combined population of 60 million. \n The official explanation has not assuaged public concern in Myanmar, where at least four patients with symptoms indicative of Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, have died in quarantine. Some panic buying of necessities has occurred in Yangon and Mandalay. \n Both Laos and Myanmar have locked down their land borders, closed schools and put hospitals on standby. \n \"We know that our country could have Covid-19 any time,\" Dr Khin Khin Gyi, spokesman for Myanmar's Health Ministry, told The Straits Times. \"We have checked the people who came though the airports. We have checked the people who came through the border points... We have not found it so far, but we are preparing for it.\" \n In Laos, Dr Reiko Tsuyuoka, the World Health Organisation's (WHO) health emergencies programme lead in the country, said: \"If and when Covid-19 arrives in Lao PDR, I expect we will know about it quickly.\" Laos is officially known as the Lao People's Democratic Republic. \n With the help of the WHO and partners, Laos' Health Ministry has developed \"a strong system for detecting and responding to health threats\", she told ST. \"It has good laboratories and a network of well-trained outbreak epidemiologists spread across the country.\" \n Laos has tested nearly 100 people for Covid-19. \"The health authorities here are taking a targeted approach to testing as the country's stock of testing reagents is quite limited at this time,\" Dr Tsuyuoka said. \n The WHO is helping Laos to stockpile protective equipment for health workers, buy additional ventilators and new laboratory equipment, as well as roll out a public awareness campaign. \n Laos has also closed all schools and entertainment venues, as well as designated a 14-day quarantine area for arrivals from high-risk countries, including Laotians returning home for the New Year festival next month, according to the Vientiane Times. The country has also revoked visa exemptions. \n In Myanmar, 175 suspected Covid-19 cases are under investigation as of Thursday night, according to the Myanmar Health Ministry website. Tests on 157 people have turned out negative, and results for another 18 are pending. \n Dr Khin Khin Gyi stressed Myanmar has no confirmation that any deaths were caused by Covid-19. \n She said the ministry is working with civil society and companies to disseminate information quickly, and has also instructed hospitals to designate rooms for patients who might be infected. In Yangon, eight hospitals have already made such preparations. Laboratory testing of samples takes place around the clock, she added. \n The United Nations Children's Fund, in a report on Myanmar released on Thursday, said \"the government acknowledged challenges in screening and response capacity in non-government-controlled areas which share a porous border with China\". \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON (AFP) - Thousands of people have died, the United States response has infuriated European allies, and China has gone on a propaganda offensive. The new coronavirus is shaping up to be a cataclysmic event with far-reaching consequences in global politics. \n The Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 130,000 people globally, strikes a world already in flux with the rise of nationalists such as US President Donald Trump who have scoffed at the rules of the \"globalist\" order. \n \"When the dust settles on the Covid-19 world, we won't be in the same place that we were just a week ago,\" said Mr Jon Alterman, a senior vice-president at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \n \"We know that governments will shake as citizens judge them to have fumbled in their response. We know that economies will be disrupted and some economies are likely to collapse,\" he said. \n Mr Trump, who initially dismissed the risks of Covid-19, late on Wednesday (March 11) abruptly imposed a 30-day ban on most travel from mainland Europe and vowed to confront the \"foreign virus\". Leaders from the European Union voiced outrage at the move, which triggered chaos at airports, and said that they had not been consulted - which Mr Trump acknowledged. \n Ms Kelly Magsamen, the vice-president for national security and international policy at the left-leaning Centre for American Progress, said Mr Trump's move would only increase questions about Washington's historic leadership role. \n \"I think a lot of partners and allies are saying, can the US be relied upon to lead on major global challenges - whether it's a pandemic or whether it's climate change or nonproliferation?\" she said. \n \"It's going to have effects on other dimensions of our relationship.\" \n Covid-19 first emerged late last year in the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan - likely at a market that sold exotic animals for their meat - and Beijing initially tried to suppress the news including by detaining the doctor who sounded the alarm. \n But China in the past week has sought to turn its Covid-19 response into a sort of soft power, with President Xi Jinping visiting Wuhan to trumpet success at containing the spread. \n China has sent medical equipment to Italy, the second-worst hit country, and Spain, highlighting its authoritarian model as decisive. \n It has also used the crisis as leverage against the United States, which has been seeking to combat Beijing's influence in all areas. \n An article in the state-run Global Times unsubtly hinted that China could stop exports of face masks and other medical gear if the Trump administration keeps pressing to restrict its tech giant Huawei. \n China as well as Russia has also promoted unfounded conspiracy theories to discredit the US. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested on Twitter that the US military may have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan. \n The Trump administration, which has offered US$100 million (S$141 million) in aid worldwide to help other countries deal with the pandemic, has in turn sought to associate China firmly with Covid-19. \n Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks of the illness as the \"Wuhan virus\" and Republican Senator Tom Cotton has vowed that the US will \"hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world.\" \n Mr Michael Green, who was the top Asia adviser to former president George W. Bush, doubted that China would ultimately find many buyers for its \"arguments about the failures of democracy\". \n But he added: \"That does not mean that the US will win this information battle.\" \n \"While the Japanese and others in Asia are not getting the shock treatment that the Europeans got overnight, there is a very strong sense of questioning American leadership right now,\" said Mr Green, now a senior vice-president at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. \n In one example, Mr Green pointed to the stalemate in talks over South Korea's contributions to US bases, with Mr Trump irritating the ally by insisting on much higher payments. \n One broader effect, Mr Green said, may be a shifting political narrative. \n Mr Xi, once seen as untouchable in China, has faced criticism as netizens cheer on doctors - much like Americans across party lines have hailed Dr Anthony Fauci, the 79-year-old veteran head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \n Mr Trump's 2016 upset win, Britain's vote to leave the European Union and other populist victories had been seen as proof \"that the technocrats failed\" following the Great Recession of the late 2000s and the Iraq war, Mr Green said. \n \"I think it's very possible that the macro result this time could be that the political populists failed and it's the technocrats who emerge as the heroes,\" Mr Green said. \n \"We'll see. But that may be how political history turns in this chapter.\" \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING (AFP) - It was supposed to be a whirlwind tour of China for Ms Jiang Lanyi's boyfriend: classical gardens in Suzhou, modern art in Shanghai, ice-skating in central Beijing. \n Instead, the 24-year-old and her Ukrainian partner have spent more than two weeks holed up in her parents' house in north-east Liaoning province to avoid the coronavirus. \n Couples around China settled for a quiet Valentine's Day this year, with Covid-19 intruding as an unwelcome third-wheel in romantic celebrations. \n The new disease has infected nearly 64,000 people and killed more than 1,350 in China, triggering transport restrictions, restaurant shutdowns, and the closure of major tourist sites. \n Businesses around the country from florists to concert halls closed shop and axed events, leaving couples with no choice but to spend the night in. \n For Ms Jiang and her boyfriend, that meant a lot of mahjong. \n \"We play two to three hours every day,\" said Ms Jiang, who met her partner, a tech entrepreneur, while studying in London. \n \"Having started learning from zero, he's now very skilled,\" she added. \n In Beijing, Valentine's Day specials aimed at couples - from a My Heart Will Go On concert to a 1,688 yuan (S$335) lobster dinner for two - were cancelled. \n Valentine's Day this year \"won't be that different from daily life under quarantine,\" said Ms Tyra Li, who lives in Beijing with her boyfriend of nearly three years. \n Since Lunar New Year, aside from a trip to see family, the couple has only left the house to buy groceries - they don't even order food delivery for fear of infection, she said. \n People wearing protective masks walk in a shopping mall decorated for Valentine's Day in Beijing, China, on Feb 12, 2020. PHOTO: EPA-EFE\n  \n \"There definitely won't be any flowers,\" the 33-year-old told AFP. \"I don't dare to receive them and he doesn't dare to buy them.\" \n The risk of infection, which has left most lovers house-bound, has battered Valentine's Day sales for businesses hoping to cash in on love. \n Flower shop Xian Hua Ge in Beijing told AFP that sales plunged by up to 70 per cent from last year - partly because many have not returned to the city to work. \n Ms Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, said in a Tuesday (Feb 11) report that the \"return rate\" of workers for China's four Tier-1 cities was only 19.4 per cent as of Feb 9, far below 66.7 per cent a year ago. \n A worker at Romanti Fresh Flowers said sales had dropped up to 50 per cent in part because customers were fearful of virus transmission via delivery staff, while another shop told AFP they had \"no stock\". \n China's wedding industry has also taken a hit, with the Chinese government urging couples to delay their nuptials earlier this month. \n Ms Zhu He, 25, who downsized her wedding due to virus fears last month, said she and her fiance had originally planned to pick up their marriage license on Valentine's Day. \n That's been delayed due to the epidemic, said Ms Zhu, who lives in southern Guangzhou city. \n \"We had planned to go together (with my parents),\" she told AFP. \"Now, they won't come even though we all live in Guangzhou.\" \n \"They both can't drive and I don't really trust public transport,\" said Ms Zhu, worried about the risk of infection. \n The coronavirus has also complicated romantic trysts, with many cities across China closing off neighbourhoods to outside visitors in a bid to contain the outbreak. \n Ms Miao Jing, a university student in northern Tianjin city, said her girlfriend had to sneak into her hotel through the car park for a three-hour rendezvous earlier this month. \n The trip was supposed to last three days, explained the 23-year-old, who took a five-hour train to northern Zhangjiakou city to see her partner. \n But on the second day, the district where Ms Miao was staying reported a confirmed case of the virus. \"She was really worried,\" Ms Miao told AFP. \"In the end, I only saw her on the first day.\" \n An empty shopping mall ahead of Valentine's Day in Beijing, China, on Feb 12, 2020.

It is closed on Jan 1, 2020. \n On Jan 9, the WHO says that the outbreak in Wuhan was caused by a previously unknown type of coronavirus, which is a broad family ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like Sars. \n To date, 59 people have been infected, of whom seven are in a serious condition, according to an official toll. \n The Chinese health authorities say a first person died of the virus on Jan 11. They revise downwards the number of sick people to 41. \n On Jan 13, the virus spreads beyond China's borders for the first time, with a case emerging in Thailand, according to the WHO. The victim is a Chinese woman diagnosed with mild pneumonia who was returning from a trip to Wuhan. \n On Jan 15, China's health commission says no human-to-human transmission of the virus behind the Wuhan outbreak has been confirmed so far, but the possibility \"cannot be excluded\". \n The next day, a first case of the virus is confirmed in Japan in someone who had stayed in Wuhan in early January. \n On Jan 17, a second person, a 69-year-old man, dies in Wuhan, according to the authorities. \n The same day, the CDC announces that it will begin screening passengers arriving from Wuhan at three airports: San Francisco, New York's JFK and Los Angeles. \n On Jan 20, a third death and more than 100 new cases are announced in China, sparking concerns ahead of the annual Chinese New Year holiday which begins on Jan 25 and sees hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel nationwide. \n The virus is present in Beijing in the north, Shanghai in the east and Shenzhen in the south. More than 200 cases have been recorded. The virus is also detected in South Korea in a Chinese person who arrived by plane from Wuhan. \n China's President Xi Jinping says that the virus must be \"resolutely contained\", in his first public comments on the outbreak. \n Human-to-human transmission is \"affirmative\", a top Chinese expert on infectious diseases Zhong Nanshan tells state broadcaster CCTV. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) has urged countries around the world to act quickly, as the window of opportunity to curb the wide spread of the disease known as Covid-19 is shrinking. \n Urging nations to invest in preparedness, the United Nations agency's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \"If we do well within the narrowing window of opportunity, we can avert any serious crisis. If we squander the opportunity, then there will be a serious problem on our hands.\" \n The warning follows a spike in the number of infected cases outside of China, with South Korea yesterday reporting that its new infections had more than doubled in a single day to 433, while Iran registered another 10 new cases. \n Japan's cases are also climbing, with 26 new cases reported yesterday to bring the total to 135. \n Meanwhile, mainland China held out hope that it was getting a grip on infections after reporting 397 new confirmed cases on Friday, down from 889 a day earlier. Just 31 new cases were reported outside the epicentre, Hubei province. There were 109 deaths on the same day. \n So far, the number of infections worldwide has climbed to more than 77,000 in some 30 countries and territories and killed more than 2,300 people, mostly in China. \n At a briefing in Geneva yesterday, Dr Ghebreyesus described the trend in cases having no clear links to China as \"very worrisome\", citing the growing number of cases in Iran in the past few days. Five people out of its 28 cases have died. \n \"Our biggest concern continues to be the potential for Covid-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems,\" said Dr Ghebreyesus, noting that the agency is helping to prepare African countries for \"the potential arrival of the virus\". \n It has identified 13 priority countries in the continent that have direct links to China and has appealed for US$675 million (S$944 million) in funds to support the most vulnerable. \n WHO has been advising countries on screening, testing, contact tracing and treatment. \n WHO's warning comes as a study in Britain predicted that as many as two-thirds of infections exported from China may have gone undetected globally, which had the potential for a massive outbreak. \n Using data from air travel, scientists at Imperial College London found some countries to have identified far fewer cases than expected based on the number of passengers arriving from Wuhan. \n Lebanon confirmed its first case on Friday, a 45-year-old Lebanese woman who had travelled from Qom in Iran. New cases were also reported in the United Arab Emirates, which yesterday confirmed that an Iranian tourist and his wife had been sickened by the coronavirus, raising the total number to 13. \n Iran's outbreak is worrying public health officials there and in the WHO. The authorities have not confirmed its origin, but one health official has suggested that it could have been imported by Chinese workers. \n Neighbouring countries have started to take action. Turkey has said all travellers from Iran will have to undergo medical checks, while Bahrain has issued an advisory against travel there. \n Northern Italy is also on alert after two deaths were caused by the coronavirus - a 75-year-old woman yesterday in Lombardy and a 78-year-old man the day before in Veneto. The region has 51 cases now. \n Meanwhile, a WHO-led mission in China for the past week travelled to Wuhan yesterday. State media Global Times said the expert team will collect wild animal samples to trace the origin of the new coronavirus and check quarantine conditions in the makeshift hospitals. \n ",
