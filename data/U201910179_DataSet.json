Although some of the masks were priced up, legislator Lin Yufeng observed that within two or three hours, the masks on the market had been taken out of stock. In order to prevent confusion, the government immediately announced that the masks should be given to residents as soon as possible today, and many casinos in mainland China were staffed yesterday At midnight, the government ordered casino staff to wear masks.\nThe Macao government announced that from tonight, Macao residents with ID cards and external labor cards can purchase 10 masks at a price of mop 8 in more than 50 pharmacies, and only once in 10 days. Li zhanrun, director of the Bureau of health, said that the government had ordered more than 20 million masks to arrive before the Spring Festival. It is expected that each resident can have more than 40 masks, which can cope with more than 40 days based on one per person per day.\nMask market breaking crisis in Hong Kong during Spring Festival\nIn Hong Kong, the government does not have a mask rationing plan. With two cases of \"highly suspected\" infection yesterday, the rush to buy them immediately followed. Liu Aiguo, vice president of the General Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong and Kowloon pharmacies, said in a radio program this morning that although the pharmacies had already added masks earlier, most of the masks in drug rooms in Hong Kong have been \"out of stock\". His pharmacies sold more than 10000 masks yesterday. He added that the pharmacy will be closed in the coming spring and may not be able to replenish until the 10th of the year (February 3).\nIn the rush to buy, businesses have their own strategies. In addition to raising the price, some businesses have increased the price to launch a mask that was pointed out to have quality problems in Japan at the beginning of last year. Some buyers have pointed out on the Internet that the packaging Wuchang, but they found that the mask only had one layer when it was used, and it is still used without protection. Other netizens suspect that Chinese manufacturers, commissioned by Japanese businesses to make masks, dumped their products in Hong Kong that had been produced but not destroyed.\nIt's still hard to forbid price hikers to work overtime in China\nIn mainland China, price hikes of masks are common. Authorities in Beijing, Guangdong, Hubei, Shanghai and Chengdu have successively issued notices asking drugstores and other sellers not to raise prices. The market supervision bureau said it would investigate and punish all kinds of illegal acts such as price bid up, hoarding and price fraud, and the violators would be given heavier punishment according to law\n。 Among them, Shanghai may impose a maximum fine of less than 3 million yuan; if the circumstances are serious, Shanghai may be ordered to suspend business for rectification or even to nail the brand.\nHowever, businesses in Shanghai still face the wind and violate the rules. According to the economic daily, a supermarket in Minhang District of the city was reported on the 21st, saying that the masks sold by the shop owners on the spot were not priced, but the prices marked on the Internet increased by 20% to 1.6 times. In addition, some businesses raised the price of anti epidemic products from 158 yuan to 398 yuan within three days. The authorities have put the business on file for investigation.\nPrice hikes are also common on multiple online shopping platforms. Take 30 9132 N95 masks with 3M brand as an example. There are Taobao stores that have raised their prices four times to 398 yuan (the same below), and 20 N95 masks with 160S brand have been raised ten times to 998 yuan. By yesterday, Taobao, Jingdong, pinduoduo, Suning e-commerce, hungry and other platforms have successively issued notices to prohibit platform businesses from raising prices when selling masks. Taobao also issued a statement on the official microblog, saying that there are sufficient supplies of masks on the platform at present and that it has provided special subsidies for masks to ensure that consumers can buy genuine masks at affordable prices.\nIn addition, there are also manufacturers of protective equipment to increase wages for employees to sell masks. Chinese media reported that the head of Zhende medical said that the factory had urgently called on employees who were taking Spring Festival leave to work overtime to produce masks and would give priority to CDC and medical institutions. In addition, hengming medicine, which supplies Taobao tmall and other online platforms, recalled employees on holiday to return to work in an emergency on the 21st, paying 3 to 5 times their salaries to workers, and fully reimbursed transportation, accommodation and other expenses to ensure the supply of masks.\n",

The first cases arose in Wuhan in central China and are believed to have originated in a market for seafood and meat from Huanan in that city.\nOutside mainland China, cases were confirmed in South Korea, the USA, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Thailand and Taiwan.\n\"A major concern is the variety of symptoms this virus is causing\nYeah. Some people are being affected and are infectious, although they have only very mild symptoms or possibly not showing any symptoms,\"Jeremy Farrar warned. It suggests, \"This may be masking the true number of infected and the extent of the transmission from person to person.\"\nIn recent days, the spectrum of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has returned, which has infected more than eight thousand people and killed nearly 800 in a pandemic that has spread across Asia between 2002 and 2003. Wellcome's director recalls, however, that \"the speed with which this virus has been identified is evidence of changes in public health in China since SARS and of strong global coordination through WHO\".\n\"The world is much better prepared to identify patients and adopt the necessary clinical and public health measures than during SARS. However, we still do not understand this virus or its clinical impact and public health. We also have no proven vaccines or treatments yet,\"says Jeremy Farrar. \"The CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations), which Wellcome supports, is currently working with global partners to accelerate the search for a vaccine for this new virus\", it ensures.\nPending further deliberation by the WHO, which has declared an international public health emergency for the epidemics of H1N1 influenza, polio and Zika-Ebola viruses, Macao authorities have cancelled the Lunar New Year celebrations. The measure had already been adopted by the local authorities of Wuhan. The New Year, which starts this Saturday, is a very special date in the Chinese calendar and takes hundreds of millions of people travelling around the country.\nIn Portugal, the Director General for Health (DGS), thanks to nuns, reported this Wednesday that \"there are no suspicious cases\", so there is no alarm situation.\nAs a precaution, DGS is \"paying more attention\" to the seven cases exported from mainland China\nYeah. Public health devices have already been deployed, with hospitals in San Juan, Oporto and Curry Cabral and Stephania in Lisbon on alert.\n",

The announcement said that the move was aimed at containing the spread of the new coronavirus epidemic and ensuring the safety of the people.\nAt this time, it has been more than a month since unknown pneumonia broke out in the seafood market of Wuhan. The deadly virus from the game stall in the seafood market mutated rapidly, spread among people, spread to other provinces and countries in China, and the epidemic in Wuhan seems to be out of control.\nChinese authorities said there was no evidence of \"human to human\" transmission for more than a month, until epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan went to Wuhan to investigate, and earlier this week announced on CCTV that the virus could be \"human to human\". Then the number of officially announced infections doubled in two days, to more than 500, and the number of officially recognized deaths increased from three to 17.\nAccording to some analysis, the actual number of infections may be more, because some patients are not included in the hospital statistics. For example, the field survey of Sanlian weekly quoted a nurse as saying that many hospitals do not accept pneumonia patients in the seafood market. Huang Chang, a dishonest seafood market owner, said his discharge did not indicate the new coronavirus pneumonia.\nThe day before Wuhan authorities announced the decision, a Chinese netizen revealed that academician Zhong Nanshan believed that the outbreak would be more dangerous than SARS in 2003 The high incidence period is expected to be from the end of February to the end of March. He suggested that Wuhan should be closed down and was rejected by the leaders concerned. As a result, he decided not to take any more media interviews.\nWuhan's anxiety is gradually rising. St é phane Lagarde, a special reporter of RFI from France and Guangzhou, today reported from Wuhan that Hankou, a coffee bar, a shop and a hotel at the intersection of the Han River and the Yangtze River are empty. South China's seafood market has been blocked and monitored after the outbreak of the virus, and other agricultural markets have been closed since this week.

MOH said it has contacted the authorities of their destination country. \n However, there was no evidence that the virus had spread to anyone here, the ministry said. \n After widening the net to include screening of temperatures of all air travellers from China, the number of suspected cases in Singapore has increased. \n The ministry said that in total, it has had 28 suspected cases aged one to 78 years. Seven people have been cleared. \n \"All measures will be taken to contain its possible spread,\" said the ministry's director of communicable diseases, Associate Professor Vernon Lee. \n More cases are expected, he added, given the large number of cases in China and high travel volume from the country to Singapore. \n As for the first case here, he had already been isolated and was no longer a risk to the public, he stressed. \n \"There's no need for general public to panic or do any special measures.\" \n Close contacts of confirmed cases will be quarantined. \n On Thursday, as part of measures to shore up defences against the virus, the newly-formed multi-ministry task force met for the first time, and decided to enhance border control and intensify border screening\n. \n This will be expanded to land and sea checkpoints by Friday morning. \n The virus, now known as 2019-nCoV, can now be passed from person to person, has already killed 17 people and infected at least 540 throughout China, with cases also surfacing in Taiwan, Japan, Macau, Thailand, Vietnam and the United States. \n Guests seen wearing masks at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa on Jan 23, 2020. ST PHOTO: TIMOTHY DAVID \n The Chinese health authorities have so far been unable to determine the origin of the virus but they say the new virus, which has no vaccine, is mutating and spreading. \n Infections are expected to spike over the Chinese New Year weekend as a large number of travellers travel to and from, as well as within, China. \n MOH on Thursday night also expanded its travel advisory, saying that Singaporeans should avoid travel to the whole of Hubei Province, in the light of the travel restrictions that China has imposed on the Hubei cities of Huanggang and Ezhou. \n Earlier in the day, the ministry urged people to avoid travelling to Wuhan only. Wuhan is also in Hubei province. \n The ministry also advised Singaporeans to continue to exercise caution and pay attention to personal hygiene when travelling to the rest of China. \n MOH has said that all travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell.

He and five other German citizens who were negative in tests remain in quarantine at the Our Lady Hospital Guadalupe Island of La Gomera for possible contain contagions, as reported Saturday morning Fernando Simon, director of the Coordinating Center Health emergencies.\nSimon has given some details of the case following a ministerial meeting evaluation and monitoring of the coronavirus, which was held at the Ministry of Health. Right now there is no other case study. The patient contracted the disease confirmed in Germany, after a \"very direct\" contact with an employee which had transmitted a female colleague who came from China. At the time of infection, this had some symptoms (although still had not tested positive), so the hypothesis that the disease can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients is increasingly losing weight, according to Simon.\nGerman tourists who are now in quarantine arrived in Spain on 28 night from Munich. At the next day, to notify the German authorities the positive in the case of the employee and have the record that those who had traveled to Spain had maintained contact with him, it was decided, in principle, a home insulation in the municipality of Hermigua. After doing tests, five of them were negative, but remain quarantined and under observation. The other was positive, so their situation is confinement in a hospital room, although on no symptoms, does not require any special care. This is a precautionary measure.\nHealth authorities are now looking for contacts to track if they appear symptoms of the disease. Two people who will track them be who traveled to her on the plane. Canary President Victor Angel Torres, reported Saturday that tourists came to Tenerife and, hence, went to La Gomera by boat, reports Pedro Murillo. The victim made the trip, an hour, to the side of a window, which \"minimizes the risks.\" \"There is an accurate description since he left Germany\" has assured the head of the Epidemiology service Canaries Domingo Nunez. \"On the boat he did not move even to go to the bathroom;. There was no contact with other passengers There is no reason to think about contact risk.\" The port of San Sebastian de La Gomera were moved by rental car to Hermigua, one small town located 20 kilometers from the capital where many houses are located.\nHealth Minister, Salvador Illa, expressed his confidence in the NHS. \"The detection and warning systems are working. We have already warned that it was possible that some cases were detected in Spain\", he has assured after the meeting between the government responsible. Illa has announced that it will convene all health counselors of the autonomous communities in an extraordinary inter-territorial council early next week to study the situation and, if necessary, strengthen the prevention and detection of the virus week.\nMeanwhile, the Spanish quarantined arrived on Friday to the Gómez Ulla hospital in Madrid also in perfect condition, the ministry reported. The center is coordinating how will the regime of family visits. The twenty nationals who are on the 17th floor of the military hospital grounds do not require evidence first, since they are not \"risk cases\" in the words of Simon, \"simply they remain in quarantine\" that China had already imposed in Wuhan.\nWuhan coronavirus has already left 304 dead and affected more than 14,000 worldwide. Of these, 151 are in 23 countries other than China. The rapid ascent of the number of cases-just over a month has exceeded the number of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, for its acronym in English), history more similar- and the first contagions outside China-and there have been not imported into Germany, the UK, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the international health emergency on Thursday.

        "news_content_translate_en": "the arrival of the coronavirus\nTrain emergency personnel and equip themselves with tools for rapid diagnosis of patients who can enter the coronavirus Wuhan. So large hospitals Spaniards before the outbreak stalking China and has reached nine other countries on board international flights are prepared. Not for now the case of Spain: the Ministry of Health reported Friday that two suspected cases under study, people with respiratory ailments recently arrived in Wuhan, have tested negative to the tests. But late in the evening the Basque Country reported that they had a patient with some suspicious symptoms he was under surveillance and had recently visited Wuhan.\n\"We are following with great interest all, but quietly. It is highly unlikely that the new virus becomes a major problem in Spain, \"notes Santiago Moreno, head of the infectious diseases service Ramón y Cajal Hospital (Madrid). This position coincides with that held by the ministry. \"People have to have a level of perceived very low risk,\" said Fernando Simon, director of the Center for Coordination and Emergency Health Alerts in the presentation of the measures agreed by Health and autonomous regions.\nThree ideas are the most repeated by experts consulted by this newspaper. The first is that what is known about the virus is still little. \"We do not know the rate of transmissibility, which tells us how many people spread each case. Nor do we know if there are asymptomatic or very mild symptoms cases, \"explains Jesús Rodríguez Bathroom, chief of the infectious diseases service of the Virgen Macarena (Sevilla) hospital.\nThe second is that, with the available data, the Wuhan seems less virulent than the other coronavirus that caused epidemic outbreaks since 2002. \"Mortality is less than 5%, while SARS and MERS were much higher [10% and 35%, respectively],\" says Juan Carlos Galan, spokesman for the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology (SEIMC). In addition, \"although it has been demonstrated transmission from person to person, does not seem too high, lower than in the SARS\" says Magda Campins, head of Preventive Medicine of the Vall d'Hebron (Barcelona) hospital.\nAs a third important idea, experts conclude that, until the investigations progress and international agencies establish more precise recommendations, it is advisable to \"adopt here the necessary steps to be prepared if a case goes,\" said José Miguel Cisneros, head of service infectious diseases of the Hospital Virgen de Rocio. \"And rest assured, because our public health system and our hospitals are amply prepared to deal with an episode like this,\" he adds.\nThe first measures taken by hospitals are to \"prepare protocols for emergency personnel, which is the gateway to the hospital,\" says Campins. \"The goal is to determine if the patient has symptoms consistent with the virus and if you have recently traveled to Wuhan\" he adds. If two events coincide, \"the patient should be admitted in isolation and medical personnel take precautionary measures usual until you discard or confirm that the disease is caused by the virus,\" says Rodríguez bathroom. These measures go through \"hand protection and respiratory barriers, such as masks high degree of protection in case there airborne\" he adds.\nThe instructions are finalizing the Ministry of Health and the Autonomous Communities establish that samples of all suspected patients will be sent to the National Microbiology Center (CNM), which will be the reference and have the results in about a day. But large hospitals have a technology called PCR, which allows advancing the diagnosis in a few hours. \"We are acquiring specific kits to genetically identify the virus with PCR Wuhan,\" says Campins. \"We have ordered the purchase and we will arrive on Monday,\" they explained from the Ramón y Cajal.\nFernando Simon said on Friday that if a positive case is detected, it will track contact, but the virus does not have \"a lot of transmissibility\". On a flight, for example, the evolution of the two passengers seated beside it would follow. The aim is that the public network is the sensitivity to detect cases without blocking the healthcare system. Health does not arise for now take exceptional measures at airports, since there are no direct flights from Wuhan and is a measure \"that has not proved useful,\" said Simon.

        "news_content_translate_en": "The pictures look like stills from a Hollywood movie -- haunted-looking people in airports, surgical masks clamped to their faces, flimsy shields against the latest virus that threatens the world. The epicentre may be Wuhan, in China, where the virus was identified in early December, but cases of the deadly Coronavirus have been reported in over a dozen countries across the world, from Australia to the US, to Germany and Sri Lanka. In China, as of January 28, there have been 106 confirmed deaths. The virus, according to Chinese scientists, likely originates from bats with over a decade's worth of research showing that Coronaviruses in bats can cause human pandemics with unusual alacrity. This novel (as in new) Coronavirus, some scientists argue, might be even more dangerous to humans than others such as SARS, the viral respiratory disease that caused hundreds of deaths around the world in eight or so months from 2002 to 2003.\nIn India, three people were kept under observation in a Delhi hospital for possibly contracting the Coronavirus. The superintendent at the Delhi hospital told reporters that the men under observation had respiratory problems and had contracted coughs, colds and fevers. Other patients in hospitals from Jaipur to Kerala have also been kept under observation. A single case in neighbouring Nepal was reported on January 24. Government authorities say they are being vigilant, running thousands of checks on travellers from the many countries in which people have been affected by Coronaviruses, but some experts have called into question the preparedness of the country's medical system to deal with any extensive outbreak.\nMany have been critical of the Chinese government's response, which has veered from lackadaisical in December, when it claimed the Coronavirus was not being spread through people to people contact, to panicked now as it has effectively put tens of millions of people in quarantine\n. A few hundred Indians, mostly medical students, are currently in Wuhan. According to a tweet by Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, a plan is being put together to evacuate Indian nationals, though a waiting Air India passenger jet had, at the time of writing, yet to be dispatched. Other countries, including Japan and the US, have also made plans to evacuate their nationals. Any 'rescue' plan, though, needs to be sanctioned by Chinese authorities, since Wuhan has been sealed off from the rest of the country. On January 27, a man died in Beijing, the first fatality in the Chinese capital.\nIn response to the Coronavirus, many countries have recommended that their nationals not travel to China. The health ministry has recommended that non-essential travel to China be postponed and that Indians in China should \"follow simple public health measures\", including frequent hand-washing and covering their mouths when coughing. Despite fears expressed about Indian preparedness, the authorities in various states insist they are taking necessary precautions. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan pointed out that despite scares and some hundreds of patients being tested and observed, there had still not been any report of a verified case of the Coronavirus in India.\nThis may be premature, given the rate at which countries around the world are reporting incidences. Nonetheless, the death toll has, so far, been confined to China, with the fatality rate remaining steady at less than three per cent. The Centre has also set up a 24-hour helpline, and has been thermal screening passengers at select airports. But the government admits it is also reliant on people -- particularly those who have travelled to China -- monitoring symptoms that are quite broad and can easily be mistaken for a regular cold, cough or respiratory illness, not uncommon in India, particularly in the pollution-ridden cities of the north\n. The advice given by authorities such as the National Disaster Management Authority has been broad and bland, encouraging good personal hygiene and attention to diet, exercise and sleep patterns.\nSuch advice is evidence that the authorities do not yet fully understand the novel Coronavirus. Work on a vaccine has begun, with the hope that experience gained in dealing with SARS will hasten the process. Even in a best-case scenario, though, any putative vaccine would take months to develop. As of now, the World Health Organization has stopped short of describing the Coronavirus as an international public health emergency, though it acknowledged that its previous assessment of the risk posed internationally was understated. Google trends have shown that while international interest in the Coronavirus has led to much internet browsing, people in Australia, Canada, India and the US, in particular, have been confusing or associating the virus with Corona beer, with searches for 'Coronavirus beer', 'Corona virus beer', and 'Virus Corona beer' spiking spectacularly over the past couple of weeks.\nPerhaps, a weak smile is still the only appropriate response to worldwide apprehension. Alarmingly, a new global health security index, released in October 2019, suggested that \"not a single country in the world is fully prepared to handle an epidemic or pandemic\". India scored above the global average, although not as highly as developed economies, and still its score was only 46.5 out of a possible 100. We are, the Chinese experience has shown, uniquely vulnerable to the Coronavirus, with people to people contact across international borders facilitating the contagion. As China is finding out, quarantining a country is nigh on impossible.\n",

Chinese authorities said the toll in China rose by a record 64 from the previous day to 425, mostly in Hubei province of which Wuhan is the capital.\nNew cases were reported in the United States including a patient in California who was infected through close contact with someone in the same household who had been infected in China.\nIt marked the second instance of person-to-person spread of the virus in the United States after another such case was reported last week in Illinois.\nWe expect to see more cases of person-to-person spread, said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThe total number of infections in China rose by 3,235 to 20,438, and there were at least 151 cases in 23 other countries and regions.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency, although experts say much is still unknown about the pathogen, including its mortality rate and transmission pathways\n.\nSuch uncertainties are leading some countries to take extreme measures to stem the spread of the virus. Australia sent hundreds of evacuees from Wuhan to a remote island in the Indian Ocean, while Japan ordered the quarantine of a cruise ship carrying more than 3,000 people after a Hong Kong man who sailed on it last month tested positive for coronavirus.\nHundreds of medical workers in the former British colony held a second day of strikes to force the government to completely close the city’s borders with mainland China, a day after embattled leader Carrie Lam left three remaining checkpoints open.\nThe Asian financial center has confirmed 15 cases of the coronavirus, yet the city’s public hospital network is struggling to cope with a deluge of patients and measures to contain the epidemic.\nHong Kong was badly hit by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that emerged from China in 2002 and killed almost 800 people around the world. According to WHO figures, SARS killed 299 people in Hong Kong during that outbreak.\nChinese data suggest that the new virus, while much more contagious than SARS, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly.\nIn Wuhan, authorities started converting a gymnasium, exhibition center and cultural complex into makeshift hospitals with more than 3,400 beds for patients suffering from mild cases of the infection, the official Changjiang Daily said.\nThe United States said on Friday it would block nearly all foreign visitors who have been to China within the past 14 days, joining Australia, Singapore, New Zealand, Vietnam and others who have imposed similar entry restrictions.\nA day after accusing Washington of scaremongering, Beijing said it would welcome assistance from the United States to fight the outbreak\n.\nChina has noted that the United States has repeatedly expressed its willingness to provide assistance to China, and hopes that the relevant assistance will be provided soon, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement on the ministry’s website.\nThe White House said China had accepted its offer to have U.S. experts as part of a WHO mission to study and help combat the virus.\nWith Wuhan and some other cities in virtual lockdown, travel severely restricted and China facing increasing international isolation, fears of wider economic disruption are growing; sources at the OPEC oil cartel said producers were considering cutting output by almost a third to support prices.\nAirlines around the world have stopped flights to parts of China. A suspension by the United Arab Emirates on Monday will affect the Gulf airlines Etihad and Emirates.\nSome economists predict world economic output will be cut by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points due to China’s lockdown.\n",

Brent sank 6.3% for the week.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 fell 63 cents, or 1.2%, to settle at $50.32 a barrel. The contract lost 2.4% for the week.\nThis week, a panel advising OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, suggested provisionally cutting output by 600,000 barrels per day (bpd).\nOn Friday, Russia Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Moscow needed more time to assess the situation.\n“Russia’s lack of commitment thus far to such a deal is providing one additional bearish element that is currently precluding the complex from sustaining price advances,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.\nPrices have fallen about a fifth since the outbreak of the virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan. China is the world’s biggest importer of crude, taking in roughly 10 million bpd in 2019.\nNovak predicted global oil demand may fall by 150,000 to 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2020 in part because of the virus.\nThe OPEC+ group this year deepened existing cuts to roughly 1.7 million bpd, nearly 2% of global demand, yet prices have remained in a narrow band. Producers in OPEC+ are scheduled to meet in Vienna on March 5-6, although the meeting could be brought forward because of concerns surrounding the virus\n.\nForecaster Eurasia Group said it estimates a contraction in oil demand in China of as much 3 million bpd in the first quarter from 2019 levels.\nU.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said on Friday that the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global energy markets is currently marginal, though it could worsen if the virus spreads.\nSources have told Reuters that Chinese policymakers are preparing measures, including more fiscal spending and interest rate cuts, amid expectations that the outbreak will have a devastating impact on first-quarter growth.\n(GRAPHIC: Change in Brent crude oil prices since Jan. 20 - here)\nU.S. energy firms added oil rigs for the third time in four weeks even though producers planned to continue reducing spending on new drilling for a second consecutive year in 2020.

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON/BEIJING (Reuters) - Independent scientists questioned research on Friday that suggested that the outbreak of coronavirus disease spreading from China might have passed from bats to humans through the illegal traffic of pangolins.\nSouth China Agricultural University, which said it had led the research, said on its website that the “discovery will be of great significance for the prevention and control of the origin (of the new virus)”.\nChina’s official Xinhua news agency reported that the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus strain separated from pangolins in the study was 99% identical to that from infected people. It said the research had found pangolins - the world’s only scaly mammals - to be “the most likely intermediate host.”\nBut James Wood, head of the veterinary medicine department at Britain’s University of Cambridge, said the research was far from robust.\n“The evidence for the potential involvement of pangolins in the outbreak has not been published, other than by a university press release. This is not scientific evidence,” he said.\n“Simply reporting detection of viral RNA with sequence similarity of more than 99% is not sufficient. Could these results have been caused by contamination from a highly infected environment?”\nPangolins are one of Asia’s most trafficked mammals, despite laws banning the trade, because their meat is considered a delicacy in countries such as China and their scales are used in traditional medicine.\nThe outbreak of disease caused by the new coronavirus, which has killed 636 people in mainland China, is believed to have started in a market in the city of Wuhan that also sold live wild animals.\nVirus experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species\n.\nJonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Britain’s University of Nottingham, said that while the South China Agricultural University research was an interesting development, it was still unclear “whether or not the endangered pangolin really is the reservoir”.\n“We would need to see all of the genetic data to get a feel for how related the human and pangolin viruses are, and also gain an understanding of how prevalent this virus is in pangolins and whether or not these were being sold in the Wuhan wet markets,” he said.\nDirk Pfeiffer, a professor of veterinary medicine at Hong Kong’s City University, also said the research was a long way from establishing a link between pangolins and the new coronavirus outbreak in humans.\n“You can only draw more definitive conclusions if you compare prevalence (of the coronavirus) between different species based on representative samples, which these almost certainly are not,” he said.\n",

On Thursday, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global emergency.\nStatistics from China indicate that just over 2% of people known to be infected with the virus have died, suggesting that it may be less deadly than the coronaviruses behind Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\nBut disease experts caution that it will take several more weeks to be confident of how the new virus behaves given how quickly it has spread and the fact that a reliable diagnostic test has only recently been introduced.\n“Not everybody is being seen, not everybody is being tested,” Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, told Reuters.\n“All the experts, myself included, tell the public that there is much we don’t know about this virus and we are learning as we go along. That is not so reassuring.”\nSome experts question whether the new virus shares similarities with seasonal flu, which has a low mortality rate but infects so many people that more than half a million may die from it each year, according to global health estimates.\nGRAPHIC: Tracking the novel coronavirus here\nThe latest statistics indicate a fatality rate of about 2.2%, but the actual rate may be higher or lower as there are likely more unconfirmed cases, he said.\nThe SARS virus killed about 10% of all infected individuals, while the MERS outbreak identified in 2012 had a fatality rate of around 35%\n.\nIn emerging infectious disease outbreaks, the most serious cases are identified first. Coronavirus infections can range from mild cold-like symptoms to severe cases that cause pneumonia, acute respiratory illness and death.\nAbout 20% of confirmed cases in the China coronavirus outbreak are classified as severe, similar to SARS and MERS, Schaffner said.\nGRAPHIC: Online package of China virus news here\nThe previously unknown strain is believed to have originated late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan.\nWithin weeks it appeared capable of being transmitted from one person to another via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n“The rapidity of this outbreak is startling and certainly much more rapid than SARS,” said Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Britain’s University of Nottingham.\nThe incubation period is estimated between one and 14 days, and there have been anecdotal accounts of “symptomless spreading” by someone who is infected but unaware of it.\nNeil Ferguson, an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College London, says that is too early to know if so-called “super-spreader” events seen with MERS and SARS is happening with the new coronavirus.\nSome 60 million people are under virtual lockdown in China’s Hubei province – of which Wuhan is the capital. Australia, South Korea, Singapore, New Zealand and Indonesia are quarantining evacuees from China for at least two weeks.\nMany global airlines have suspended or scaled back direct flights to China’s major cities.\nExperts say China has been more forthcoming with information than it was during its 2003 SARS outbreak, but there are still concerns about how much data they are sharing.\nSome also questioned the effectiveness of the quarantine attempt on millions of people.\n“That kind of thing can backfire.

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Adds quotes, colour from passengers)\nBy David Dolan and Elaine Lies\nTOKYO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Ten more people on a quarantined cruise liner in a Japanese port have tested positive for coronavirus, officials said on Thursday, taking the number of infected passengers to 20 with test results on more than 170 still pending.\nAbout 3,700 people are facing at least two weeks quarantine on the Diamond Princess ship in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, after 10 people were initially confirmed with the virus and moved to medical facilities.\nThe total number of coronavirus patients in Japan is now 45. Test results on around 171 people from the cruise ship are still pending. The 10 new cases included four Japanese, two Americans, two Canadians, one person from New Zealand and one from Taiwan.\nCarnival’s Diamond Princess was caught up in the global coronavirus epidemic after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man tested positive for the virus after disembarking late last month. The ship arrived in Yokohama on Monday after a 14-day round trip.\nClyde and Renee Smith, a U.S. couple who are both 80 and on the cruise with two adult grandsons, said they were on a bus trip with the man in Kagoshima, southern Japan, but both tested negative for the virus.\nThey were enduring their second day in a stateroom that, as Renee told Reuters by phone from the ship, “is tiny, we don’t have a window, there are four of us - and only one chair.”\nThey’ve spent time reading and watching movies, including “Crazy Rich Asians” and “Aquaman.” Grandson Sawyer Smith, 25, a workout devotee, does crunches since he can’t visit the gym.\n“It’s not really to the point where we’re getting stir-crazy, if they keep us in the rooms for four to five days it might be a little different,” Sawyer said.\nOthers, though, were starting to feel confined\n.\nOne 43-year-old Hong Kong resident, also in a windowless room, said they had received food, toilet paper and games and art supplies for their child.\nBut it was sunlight they wanted, he said.\n“Wondering though when we can step outside the room, if at all, for sunlight,” the man, who declined to be named, told Reuters, adding he hadn’t been in direct sunlight since Tuesday.\n“I got a peek of it when the opposite room opened their door to receive breakfast, as that room has a balcony. The sky looked blue.”\nOther passengers said food delivery to the rooms was slow.\n“Of course, our greatest worry is that we have been infected,” said Gay Courter, a 75-year-old U.S. novelist.\n“We are hopeful that the U.S. government will be sending transport for the Americans on board it’s better for us to travel while healthy and also if we get sick to be treated in American hospitals.”\nConcern has also spread to ports the ship visited along the way, including Naha on Japan’s tropical Okinawa island and Taipei in Taiwan, where passengers went on day trips.\nA health official in Naha said they were trying to trace the path of the infected passengers, while Taipei’s National Palace Museum disinfected its exhibition rooms and Taiwan banned all cruise ships from making port.\nJapan is making arrangements to send a fourth chartered plane to Wuhan to pick up around 200 people on Thursday night, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. These are likely to include Chinese spouses as well as Japanese.\nThe virus death toll in mainland China hit 563 on Thursday, with almost 3,000 new cases reported.\nChina’s National Health Commission said another 3,694 coronavirus cases were reported throughout the country on Feb. 5, bringing the total to 28,018.\nNearly 260 cases have been reported in 31 other countries and regions outside mainland China, according to a Reuters tally based on official statements from the authorities involved\n.

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A cluster of more than 50 pneumonia cases in the central Chinese city of Wuhan may be due to a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly SARS and MERS outbreaks, World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.\nWhile the United Nations health agency said it needed more comprehensive information to confirm precisely the type of pathogen causing the infections, it said a new coronavirus was a possibility.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Some of the virus types cause less severe disease, while some - like the one that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) - are far more severe.\n“The initial information about the cases of pneumonia in Wuhan...pointed to a coronavirus as a possible pathogen causing this cluster,” the WHO said in a statement.\nIt added that since Chinese authorities have conducted laboratory tests and eliminated the SARS coronavirus and the MERS one as possible causes, as well as flu, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens, “therefore, a novel coronavirus could not be ruled out”.\nThe pneumonia outbreak started last month, and 59 cases had been reported by Chinese authorities by Sunday.\nThe WHO noted that coronaviruses emerge periodically - including in 2002 to cause SARS and in 2012 to cause MERS.\nIt said that according to Chinese authorities, the virus behind the Wuhan cases can cause severe illness in some patients and does not appear to pass easily from person to person.\n“More comprehensive information is required to confirm the pathogen, as well as to better understand the epidemiology of the outbreak, the clinical picture, the investigations to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection, and the countermeasures implemented,” the WHO said\n.\nIn 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumours forced the government to reveal the epidemic. The disease spread rapidly to other cities and countries in 2003. More than 8,000 people were infected and 775 died. (Reporting by Kate Kelland, editing by Cynthia Osterman)\n",

Chinese authorities have restricted intercity traffic and extended the Spring Festival holiday, with tourism, entertainment and retail sectors most affected, and extended factory closures could put pressure on China's industrial production and trade.\nAccording to Morgan Stanley economist Xing Ziqiang in the report, \"if the new coronavirus epidemic reaches its peak in 2 and March, China's first quarter economic growth may slow down by 0.5-1 percentage points. However, driven by replenishment demand and counter cyclical policy, there will be a recovery after the first quarter.\" \"If the epidemic peaked in 3-4 months, the drag on economic growth in the first half of this year may be 0.6-1.1 percentage points, but some of the impact will be offset by stronger policy support,\" he said\nReuters quoted the bank as saying that the outbreak had some negative effects on global economic growth in the first quarter, but since the impetus to promote global economic recovery was not damaged, once the outbreak subsided, it could return to the recovery track.\nThe Reuters said that the national health and Health Committee said on Wednesday that as of January 28th (Tuesday) 24, the total number of deaths from new coronavirus infection increased to 132, 1459 new confirmed cases, 9239 suspected cases, and 5974 confirmed cases.\n",

At 0:38 a.m. on July 7, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a special message on the official microblog, stressing that Li Wenliang was critically ill and that the hospital was trying its best to rescue him.\nThe Chinese media \"life times\" issued a letter at micro-blog on the evening of 6, and the reporter alleged that Li Wenliang had died of the 2019 coronavirus infection at 9:30 pm. \"Surging news\" reported at 11:00 p.m. on the 6th, according to a reporter quoted by zhongxin.com, Li Wenliang's colleague, doctor Zhou, confirmed that the hospital intubated Li Wenliang in the evening for emergency treatment, but the hospital has yet to announce the death.\nBut late Saturday night, China News Weekly, a subsidiary of China News Agency, claimed that Li Wenliang was still in intensive care, the report said. In a micro blog post, the media quoted a doctor from Wuhan Union Medical College Hospital as saying that Li Wenliang's heart stopped at 9:30 p.m. but used the Yeke membrane for rescue.\nAccording to the report, Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist in Wuhan Central Hospital, released a message in the group of students on December 30 last year that he saw a test report of a patient and detected positive indicators of high confidence of SARS coronavirus. Seven suspected patients reminded students to pay attention to protection. After the message was circulated on Weibo, on January 3 this year, the Public Security Bureau found him and pointed out that he had issued \"false statements\", put forward warnings and criticisms, and demanded to sign the admonition book.\nLi Wenliang continued to see the doctor later. After receiving Wuhan pneumonia patients, he began to cough on January 10, had a fever on January 11, and was hospitalized on January 12. At that time, he questioned why the official notice \"still said that no one passed on people and no medical staff were infected\". He came to the intensive care unit and was confirmed to be infected with a new coronavirus after several tests. On the 1 th of this month, he announced the confirmation message on his micro-blog.\nAccording to the report, after the news of Li Wenliang's rescue, Chinese netizens sent messages on microblogs to mourn, \"the country owes him a solemn apology!\" \"When will he be returned to justice?\" Many Weibo netizens also found that the post about Li Wenliang's death in the global times, the party's media, had been deleted. Weibo also seemed to reduce the search enthusiasm of the incident. The message area was also \"harmonious\". Netizens questioned that the authorities intended to put the matter down\n。\nAccording to Sina Weibo, the first Whistler of the new coronary pneumonia (2019 ncov, commonly known as Wuhan pneumonia) was Li Wenliang, a 34 year old Wuhan ophthalmologist, who was the first person to warn the world of the outbreak. He had a pregnant wife and 5-year-old child, the world daily reported today, but the official Weibo of Wuhan Central Hospital in China was at 12:38 p.m. local 7 (11:38 a.m. EDT 6) Points) said Li Wenliang was critically ill and had been put on the yak film to rescue him.\nMany Chinese netizens saw the news of Li Wenliang's death on the Internet, expressing their regret and denouncing the Communist Party's system and attitude towards the epidemic.\nAccording to the report, Li Wenliang was critically ill on the night of the 6th and stopped beating for more than three hours at 0:00 on the 7th.\n",

This is Xi Jinping's second confidence in the world. In January 28th, Xi Jinping met with WHO director general Tan Desai, but little success. China's stock market plummeted, followed by global stock market turbulence.\nXi Jinping also said on Friday that China and the United States signed the first stage of the trade agreement, and that China will conscientiously implement the consensus and push forward Sino US cooperative relations.\nChina and the United States signed the first phase of the trade agreement on January 15, and Beijing promised to buy US goods and services worth US $200 billion within two years. The first phase of the U.S. - China trade agreement will take effect after February 14, when the U.S. will reduce tariffs on $120 billion worth of Chinese products by 7.5%. China will also need to implement regulations on the volume of purchases of US goods and domestic structural reform.\nU.S. President trump praised China's statement of preparing to implement the agreement during the call, saying the two countries will continue to closely communicate.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Stephen mnuchin said Thursday that despite the chaos caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus, he acknowledged that it would have a negative impact on the global economy, but there would be no heavy blow.\nThe global automobile production chain is impacted by the virus epidemic\nAgence France-Presse pointed out that the crisis triggered by the outbreak of the new coronavirus is hitting the global automotive industry, and has spread from China to other countries. The new supply of coronavirus has caused the interruption of the supply chain of China's manufacturing parts, resulting in the announcement of a total stoppage of production this week by the modern automobile group, the largest automobile manufacturer in Korea.\nEuropean auto production has also been affected, with Italian and US car brands Fiat Chrysler saying that if Chinese parts suppliers fail to resume production as soon as possible, they will be forced to reduce production and the company may be forced to suspend operations at an assembly plant in Europe.\nThe analysis points out that the next few weeks are crucial for global automakers. Parts made in China are used to assemble millions of cars, and Wuhan, the hardest hit area of this coronavirus epidemic, is also the main center of auto parts production and transportation. In order to control the epidemic, some factories in China are expected to return to work after February 10.\nOther global automakers say they are concerned about the risks to the auto industry\n。\nGM's chief financial officer pointed out that the group has multiple teams working intensively to avoid problems.\nAlthough some auto manufacturers can transfer production, they need time to establish auto parts production lines and diversify the production chain.\nDelay or cancellation of several major exhibitions\nThe new coronavirus has killed at least 636 people and infected tens of thousands of people. The Art Basel, originally scheduled to be held in Hong Kong at the end of March, has been cancelled. The world-renowned annual meeting of contemporary art attracts artists and collectors from all over the world, which is undoubtedly another blow to Hong Kong's economy.\nIn addition, more than 20 large-scale trade fairs and conferences in Asia have been postponed or cancelled. For example, China's oldest and largest trade fair, Guangzhou Fair, has been suspended. During these meetings, sales contracts signed reached tens of billions of dollars.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Prepare for the coronavirus. This is the huge headline on the front page of the Liberation Daily. This is the second time that the newspaper has published the new coronavirus in a critical position on the front page. The editorial of the newspaper explains that this is not to make a fuss, nor to sensationalize people, but because in the face of China's autocratic system, we must be extremely cautious, although Beijing authorities seem to be making information transparent this time Ming has made efforts, but is this enough to win the trust of the Chinese people and the international health organization?\n\"Liberation Daily\" introduced the news that Chinese Premier Li Keqiang went to Wuhan to express solidarity, pointing out that the mayor of Wuhan disclosed in an interview with CCTV that the reason for blocking the news at the first time was that his superiors did not give instructions, obviously trying to shift the responsibility to the central government. In addition, the liberation daily received valuable testimony from a Chinese media reporter who stayed in a small city in Hubei Province, more than 100 kilometers away from Wuhan. The reporter introduced to the Liberation Daily that her family in Wuhan could not get enough food. The family tried to drive away from Wuhan but four roads were blocked. Other Wuhan people who travel in other places can't go home, and they are driven everywhere. Wuhan people and Hubei people have become street mice in China. She also condemned how Wuhan had concealed the epidemic from other locals after reporting it elsewhere. It criticized Xi Jinping, chairman of China, for not referring to Wuhan in his new year's greetings. Jackie Chan, a Hong Kong film star, claimed at the new year's party not to believe rumors. There was no virus at all. Finally, the Chinese journalist worried to the Liberation Daily that the Beijing government set up an emergency response team on Sunday, but the group was headed by officials from the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, which means they will continue to block the news.\nThe Liberation Daily then used a whole page to answer the frequently asked questions about the new crown epidemic in detail: the new crown virus is mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract, and most of the patients who died at present are over 60 years old and suffering from other diseases. How to treat patients with new coronavirus infection? At present, there is no other medicine besides the antipyretics. Doctors are trying to use the anti-virus drugs to treat AIDS and Ebola, but they are not sure about the efficacy.\nThe new crown virus triggered a global stock market panic, which is the front page headline of the financial newspaper echo. Echo pointed out that European stock prices have lost 2% and oil prices have fallen below $60 per barrel. The profits of 40 industrial indexes in France in January have become mainstream\n。 The virus has posed a serious threat to many industries in China and has also raised concerns among French companies in China.\nChina's entertainment industry is the first to bear the brunt, with the vast majority of Chinese cinemas closed and many blockbusters delayed. Last year, China's box office revenue during the Spring Festival exceeded 1.5 billion yuan, compared with 18 million yuan this year\nSecondly, the tourism industry has also suffered a huge setback. Since Monday, China's travel agencies have been banned from group travel and booking hotels for customers. Not only has China's domestic tourism industry been affected, but many Chinese have cancelled plans to travel to Southeast Asia or even to France, which will cause huge losses to major airlines and the luxury industry in France.\nIn addition, French enterprises in China are also facing serious challenges. Wuhan is the headquarters of French symbol Citroen and Renault automobile group in China. The head of the group told reporters that, of course, the top priority is the safety of employees in China. However, they are also preparing for the resumption of production. However, the key to the problem is that we do not know how long the policy of closing Wuhan will last.\nFrench customs intercepts Chinese watches with excessive lead content\nFinally, the Paris people's Daily reported that the French customs had seized a batch of Chinese watches with excessive lead content. It said that there were 28000 watches in total in this batch. The importer was located in aubervilliers, a suburb of Paris. After inspection, the lead content of the metal parts of these watches exceeded 40 to 70 times. According to French health experts, lead is very harmful to human body, and only a very small amount is likely to cause lead poisoning. According to reports, the goods monitoring business was ordered to pay a fine, the French customs have returned the goods to the shipper. Customs officials said that if it is forged goods, customs will destroy them according to law. However, although these low-quality products do not meet the quality indicators within the EU, they do not violate the law. However, he also said that French customs should destroy these inferior foods because they are likely to be transported to areas with poor sanitation, such as Africa.\nIn addition, the focus of the newspapers also includes the defeat of the far right party in the local elections in Italy, the split in the ruling party in the upcoming local elections in France in March, especially in the municipal elections in Paris, and the refusal of mathematician Villani to accept the request of President Marcon to insist on a fight with the candidates recommended by the ruling party.\n",

This point is discussed in an article published by biorxiv Electronic Science Library.\n\"Our study refutes the assumption that the 2019-ncov virus was generated as a result of a recent recombination. In particular, about half of its genome, including the coding part of the spines on its shell, is responsible for entering human cells, This is a unique new coronavirus line, unlike other SARS related pathogens, the scientists wrote.\nThe first analysis of the DNA structure of the new Colorado virus that broke out in China last December showed that, The cause of the disease is a recombination of the so-called ratg13 virus, which affects bats and some unknown coronaviruses.\nUsing the term, scientists refer to two viruses that infect the same body at the same time, which in some cases leads to the exchange of DNA or RNA. For example, coronavirus, the coding of some parts of its genes.\nAbout In the case of the 2019 ncov virus, Chinese geneticists believe that the exchange of this genetic material enables it to spread from humans to humans, And other unique features.\nMolecular biologists at the University of Athens were skeptical, comparing mutations in the 2019 ncov and ratg13 genomes. On the one hand, this analysis confirmed that the new virus is indeed closely related to the pathogens of bats living in Yunnan Province. But in doing so, he found some unique features in RNA viral devices that do not conform to the recent composite theory.\nIn particular, scientists have found no evidence that the 2019 ncov gene is a mosaic of RNA fragments of various viruses, and have found some unique shortcomings, Its structure is different from that of other SARS viruses in 2003, At the same time, attack bats. How these sequences appear in 2019 ncov RNA is unknown to scientists, but their presence clearly suggests that viruses cannot be produced by recombination.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Letters and parcels from China? Can be received without driving. Vaccines for pneumonia? Don't help with the new Coronavirus. Should I eat garlic? It's healthy, but there's no evidence that it's protecting it from the pathogen.\nThese questions and answers come from the World Health Organisation (WHO) website. Under a heading called myth busters, the WHO tries to fight myths. The United Nations authority is thus trying to counter the rumours about the new Coronavirus. Because rumors, misinformation and conspiracy theories spread faster than the virus itself.\nAt the end of 2019, a new virus broke out in China, 2019nCoV, closely related to the deadly Sars virus. Meanwhile, thousands of people have been infected, hundreds have died, and many countries have long reported cases. Because the pathogen was unknown last year and the consequences of the outbreak are not yet predictable, there is a great need for knowledge: Google Trends is showing a rapid increase in the corona virus in January. A demand that remains undiscovered: more than 15 million tweets about the Coronavirus have been posted on Twitter in the last four weeks, and new news and assessments are appearing daily in the media. There are so many contributions that the WHO writes about an information epidemic, an abundance of information, correct but also wrong.\nIn general, it is necessary to distinguish between uncertain information, news ripped out of context or false news and conspiracy theories. For example, the story of a couple of parents who allegedly left their two sick children at the airport is circulating online. There's no proof of that. Just like a video that spreads in alarmist tones alleged facts about the virus\nYeah. The claims in it are partly exaggerated, partly unfounded, partly incorrect, as the Correctiv portal has researched. But there are conspiracy theories. It is said that the outbreak was based on a plot by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. That's not true either.\nNow you may find this information harmless. In part, however, the false information circulating around the new Coronavirus is harmful, even life-threatening. About when they advertise supposed remedies or treatments. For example, the Indian Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Natural Medicine recommends homeopathic treatment of coronary lung disease. The effect of homeopathy beyond the placebo effect has not been demonstrated. And there's a rumor on Facebook that it cures a coronavirus infection by drinking a chemical solution called MMS. This is not only wrong, but even life-threatening when used. Facebook, usually not known for its intensive handling of false content, has now announced to remove corresponding posts from its platform. Twitter not only wants to delete misleading posts, but only to find credible information when searching for the Coronavirus, it says in a blog post.\nThe media dynamics that can be observed at the moment are not new. It resembles other news stories, whether terrorist attack or plane crash: first something bad happens, then information spreads in the social media in minutes, and finally media reports. People read posts or articles, look for more information, for certainty. But because there is still little certainty, there is room for rumors, false information and even conspiracy theories.\nYeah. The effect is reinforced by the fact that the level of knowledge around the centre of the news, in this case the corona virus disease, can constantly change and what seems certain today could be refuted tomorrow.\nNicole Kramer works as a professor of social psychology at the University of Duisburg-Essen and researches, among other things, on Fake News. She sees several reasons for spreading false and uncertain information: \"There is still a lot of uncertainty about the Coronavirus,\" she says, \"and because the outbreak is threatening to become a pandemic, and so everyone in Germany could eventually be in danger of getting infected, the need for information was particularly great. People sent information they see too quickly, Kramer says, often without having read the message accurately. Images with particularly frightening motives, such as pictures from overcrowded hospital halls, on which patients lie on the floor, fired this: \"Some texts will certainly be passed on because the power of the images is so strong,\" says Kr am er. We are all responsible for spreading false information.\" It is less relevant who puts the wrong message into the world, but who disseminates it. And these are mostly people, not bots,\"says Kramer.\nBut, of course, misinformation is not only unwittingly disseminated. There are also actors who purposefully disseminate the information, Kramer says. These could be laymen who simply want attention, but also state actors who want to create unrest.\nAdditionally, especially on health issues, much reliance is placed on the experience of others, communications scientist Markus Schafer of the University of Mainz told ZDF. Together with colleagues, he has investigated how Internet users learn about health\nYeah. According to this, almost every second respondent (46 percent) claims to be informed about health issues in personal conversations with family, friends and colleagues. 39 percent use the Internet, in the age group from 18 to 29 there were even 46 percent (journal for online consulting and computer-mediated communication: Shepherd et al., 2019). Only health issues are often very complex.\" That is why misinformation in this area spreads so well,\"says Schafer. Medicine is not an exact science. In medical practice, scientific knowledge and experience come together. There is sometimes more room for rumours than for scientific questions.\nThe impact of such false information is not only problematic in the short term, but also in the long term. In psychology, one speaks of the misinformation effect: if one reads incorrect information directly after an event, it can lead to one noticing it, even if one should actually know that it is not true (for example Loftus, 2005).\" This is normal in evolutionary psychology,\"says social psychologist Kramer. At first we believed what we saw and did not immediately doubt everything. The problem was that misinformation would be as well received as facts. The wrong information could hardly be overwritten. Therefore, even if people have read a correction, they may remember the wrong information.\nIt becomes even more difficult when the false information you read fits into your own worldview. Because we all tend to believe what we want to believe. In psychology, it's called confirmation bias. In the case of the Coronavirus, this is good to observe: anyone who wants to believe that the world is in the midst of a pandemic will find and share information that suits them. If you want to believe the pathogen is harmless, find the opposite information\nYeah. It is still unclear how deadly the virus really is, and whether the outbreak will take on a global scale.\nSo how do you make sure that what you read is actually true?\" Those who see a text online should not just share it, but read it all,\"says social psychologist Kramer. It also helps to keep an eye on the sources. Is a contribution based on scientific knowledge? Can you check what's in there? Does anyone just quote from other media? What is the original source? Is there even one? This may sound trivial, but can effectively help identify misinformation. According to Kramer, the media, too, would be responsible for correcting reports if they originally contained false information.\nExperts are already calling for a global media strategy for future outbreaks of disease.\" We need effective media observers to monitor how outbreaks of disease are reported,\"writes Ilona Kickbusch, professor of global health in Geneva, and Gabriel Leung, Dean of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong, in a paper for the British Medical Journal. In the future, the WHO should not only contact social media, but also work with well-known fact-tellers. It is also possible to find out whether information would be withheld or whether critical journalists and journalists would be silenced.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires\nYeah. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from person to person\nYeah. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nRead more about the outbreak of the new Coronavirus here.\n",

Currently, a woman who had been travelling in China as a tourist at the beginning of January is treated in isolation at the intensive care station of Bremen-Mitte Hospital. Whether she actually infected herself with the virus is still unclear.\nMartin Goetz, head of the Health Department's Infection Control Unit, confirms the suspicion, but warns against excessive fear of a disease. Upon her return from China, the woman complained of symptoms similar to the new type of lung disease, and therefore reported to the emergency room of the clinic.\n\"The patient meets certain criteria,\" says Goetz, \"but it has not yet been confirmed that this case is actually the corona virus. The patient is clinically well.\"Her blood samples have been sent to the Charity in Berlin and are examined there in a special laboratory. According to God, the evaluation itself takes place within one day. However, until the results are available in Bremen, it may take up to five days by post.\n\"Until the case is confirmed or there is revelation, we treat it as if it were a real case of the Coronavirus,\" says Goetz. The Health Department had already informed Bremer hospitals a week ago about the special protective measures according to the requirements of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin, which intervene in suspicious cases. This includes the strict isolation of patients, which is best possible in the clinic in the middle of the ICU, which is why the woman is there, as well as protective clothing for doctors and nursing staff.\n\"We try to keep the number of people who come into contact with possible patients as low as possible,\" explains Rolf Conclusiter, spokesperson for the Northern Health Clinical Association.\nYeah. The precautions taken to prevent the spread of actual Corona cases are high. This is also confirmed by Michael Bojarra, chief hygienist at Red Cross Hospital. The recommendations of the ICRC and the World Health Organisation would also be closely monitored and implemented there.\nIf there were indeed cases of the disease in Bremen, According to Goetz, patients are expected to be treated in a larger isolated hospital in Bremen-Ost or, depending on their individual state of health, to be transferred directly to the Bernhard Nocht Institute in Hamburg, specialised in tropical and all new diseases.

In January, with a respiratory infection from a Chinese trip, he was asked not to leave his apartment.\nA precise diagnosis is still pending in his case, but according to the Office he was not in the Corona-Risk region of Hubei. His general health was good. According to the health department's infection protection expert, it was only a matter of time before the first suspicious cases appeared in Germany. \"But one cannot assume that we have a disease that also spreads in Bremen,\" says Martin Goetz, \"even if it turns out that the patient has the virus. This is the place to be.\"\nIt refers to the current raging normal flu wave. In addition, he considers that the likelihood of the Coronavirus reaching Bremen via travellers from the affected areas is rather low. Bremen does not have a direct flight to China. Wuhan, where the virus first appeared in early January, is not flown from Germany at all, European flights go through Paris, London or Rome.\nAccording to a media report in Beijing, a person died for the first time from the new Coronavirus\nYeah. As the Chinese national television station CCTV reported on Monday evening, the 50-year-old man had previously returned from a trip from Wuhan. China's state television reported on the basis of government reports that the number of confirmed infections has risen to 2744 nationwide, the number of deaths to 80's, mostly elderly people with severe pre-conditions.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SYDNEY • The global cost of the coronavirus could be three or four times that of the 2003 Sars outbreak that sapped the world's economy by US$40 billion (S$54.8 billion), according to the economist who calculated that figure. \n The sheer growth of the Chinese economy over the last 17 years means the global health emergency triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, which originated in Wuhan, has far greater potential to gouge global growth, according to professor of economics Warwick McKibbin at the Australian National University in Canberra. \n \"It's just a mathematical thing,\" he said in a phone interview. \"Most of the GDP loss that we saw in the Sars model, and in reality, was China slowing down. And so, with China much bigger, you'd expect the billions would be much bigger.\" \n While difficult to pinpoint a precise cost as the crisis is still unfolding, the impact will be experienced mostly through changes in \"human psychology\", he said. \"Panic is what seems to be the biggest drain on the economy, rather than deaths.\" \n Markets have been whipsawed by panic, Paris-based Amundi Asset Management said in a Jan 29 note. Chief investment officer Pascal Blanque and his deputy Vincent Mortier said the outbreak provided the trigger for a pause in a stock-market rally that began in October. Prof McKibbin's forecasts are in line with those of other analysts. \n Nomura International expects the blow to China's growth could exceed that seen during the Sars outbreak. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter could \"materially drop\" from the 6 per cent pace in the fourth quarter, maybe by even more than the 2 percentage point deceleration seen in the second quarter of 2003 from the first, Nomura economists wrote in a report to clients. \n Bloomberg economists Chang Shu, Jamie Rush and Tom Orlik said: \"Back in 2003, China accounted for just 4 per cent of global GDP\n. Fast forward to 2020, and its share has increased to 17 per cent. That means the global spillover if China's growth slumps will be larger. \n \"Hong Kong stands out as the most exposed - our simulation shows a hit of 1.7 percentage points (ppt) in the first quarter. South Korea and Vietnam would also suffer, each slowing by 0.4 ppt. Japan would take a 0.2 ppt hit.\" \n More contagious than Sars but less deadly so far, the insidious nature of the new coronavirus, dubbed 2019-nCoV, is such that it often presents as mild cold-like symptoms and can go undetected, which could potentially mean a protracted crisis that is longer than the 2003 epidemic. \n The new virus, which emerged in central China late last year, is reported to have infected almost 10,000 people in two months, eclipsing the 8,096 Sars cases reported from November 2002 through 2003, when the contagion spread from China across South-east Asia and to North America and Europe. \n \"If a country had a bad epidemiological outcome, then their shocks were likely be a lot bigger than countries that were able to control it well,\" Prof McKibbin said, referring to his findings from examining the impact of Sars. \n BLOOMBERG\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "A new coronavirus with epicenter in Wuhan, China, has been frightening the world. You've killed over a hundred people and infected thousands of them. How can genetics be used to oversee viruses like this and watch how they spread? In an article published this Wednesday in the mSphere scientific journal of the American Society for Microbiology, a team of scientists describes an improvement in the new generation genetic sequencing to monitor coronavirus, especially those from bats.\nCoronavirus are a large family of viruses that live in animals such as birds or bats. They can be transmitted from animals to people, but most of the coronavirus strains only circulate between animals and do not even infect humans. If they reach humans, they can cause respiratory diseases, from a cold to more serious situations such a s severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\nTo monitor how coronavirus spreads and evolves in animals, new generation sequencing (NGS) has been used. However, this sequenc e can be very expensive and many genetic markers of viruses can be lost.\nA team led by Lin-Fa Wang (from Duke University Medical School and Singapore National University) decided to make NGS cheaper and more effective. To this end, it perfected one of the strategies of NGS with molecular probes: DNA or radioactive RNA sequences used to detect the presence of a complementary sequence in a sample.\nIn the experiments, we were able to identify coronavirus, increase the sensitivity of the process and decrease its cost, as stated in a communication about work. \"It does not mean that this improvement is a panacea for all NGS challenges, but in this case it is a step in the right direction,\" Lin-Fa Wang considers\nYeah.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThe investigator adds that this approach will be important to monitor coronavirus in bats. \"Coronavirus, especially bats, is an important source of emerging infectious diseases,\" says Lin-Fa Wang, who has the nickname Batman. For example, the coronavirus that caused the SARS outbreak in 2003 is very close genetically to what is found in bats.\nAlthough it is not yet known the origin of the new coronavirus whose epidemic began in Wuhan, bats are one of the likely sources. These animals may also be a reservoir of the Ebola or Nipah virus. In a scientific article published in 2018 in Cell Host and Microbe magazine, it is suggested that bats will be able to host many viruses due to the evolutionary adaptations they had to make to fly, which ultimately changed their immune system.\nAnd how can the new approach contribute to combating an epidemic? When there are no outbreaks, scientists can update the genetic probing banks related to coronavirus. During outbreaks, this information can be used to monitor the evolution of the virus and its transmission in animals and people.\n",

The previous balance pointed to 7736 infected people and 170 dead.\nThe figures announced concern the last 24-hour period and represent more 43 dead and almost two thousand cases of infection in relation to the latest data submitted by the Chinese authorities. The vast majority of cases occurred in Hubei Province and its capital, Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.\nAccording to the daily report of the National Health Commission, updated at four o'clock (Thursday 20h in Lisbon), the number of patients in serious condition is 1527, while 171 people have already been discharged.\nThe outbreak began in December in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province in central China, and on Thursday the World Health Organization (WHO) declared international public health emergency, at a time when the epidemic spread to more than a dozen countries.\nIn addition to China and the Chinese territories of Macao and Hong Kong, more than fifty confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in 19 other countries (Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Nepal, Malaysia, United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Australia, Finland, United Arab Emirates, Cambodia, Philippines) And India. According to Reuters, two UK cases were detected early this Friday morning, the first in the country. Russia also announced that the first two cases were detected in a Chinese couple.\nThis Friday the Italian Government declared a state of emergency after the first two cases of coronavirus have been identified on two Chinese tourists visiting Rome. The authorities are now trying to figure out what their itinerary has been since they arrived in Italy.\nYeah.\nSingapore announced this Friday that all visitors who have been to China recently were not allowed in and have also suspended issuing visas to all people with Chinese passports, the ban comes into force this Saturday. Mongolia had also announced that it would close its land borders with China (as well as Russia, North Korea and Vietnam) to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\nAn international public health emergency requires the adoption of preventive and coordination measures on a global scale. To state this, the WHO considers three criteria: an extraordinary situation, a risk of rapid expansion to other countries and a coordinated international response. This is the sixth time the WHO has declared an international public health emergency.\nThe Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the new coronavirus outbreak, has been isolated from the world for a week, like the almost whole of Hubei Province, where 56 million people live, prevented from leaving the region.\nThe United States and Japan withdrew part of their fellow citizens from Wuhan. Portugal will also repatriate citizens from the same Chinese city along with other European countries.\nOn Thursday Russia announced its intention to close 4250 kilometres of border with China and Kazakhstan ordered the closure of bus, plane and train links with the same neighbouring country.\nThe US recommended its citizens not to travel to China because of the new coronavirus, raised the alert level to a level and advised Americans to leave Chinese territory.\nThe Americans \"currently in China should explore the possibility of leaving the country using commercial means\", stated the State Department in a statement published on their website\nYeah.\nOn the other hand, it called for \"all non-essential US government officials to postpone their trip to China because of the new coronavirus,\"\nSeveral airlines have decided to suspend or reduce their flights to mainland China in view of the spread of the new coronavirus. The WHO opposed travel restrictions, although the outbreak of the new coronavirus in China was an international public health emergency. Nevertheless, the Italian government suspended all flights to or from China after confirmation of two cases in the country of the new coronavirus.\nMacao International Airport (MIA) cancelled hundreds of flights and received fewer 25% of passengers between 24 and 28 in January, Chinese Lunar New Year period, compared to the same period of celebrations in 2019. The first case of the new coronavirus was made public in Macao to 22 in January, days before the week of Lunar New Year celebrations, when thousands of tourists visit the game's world capital, most of them from mainland China.\nHundreds of flights to and from Macao have been cancelled, most to and from mainland China.

Until now, we have been preserved from less good news on this subject, but no one is always preserved, with the circulation in the world, with the mobility in the world.\nThe head of state, who spoke to journalists on the balcony of the Bethlehem Palace in Lisbon, pointed out to his own family as an example, stating that he has grandchildren who arrived in Portugal from China at a time of \"full outbreak of the virus\" and that \"it is only at the end of this week that they truly spend fifteen days on their staying here\".\n\"Therefore, no one is preserved\", said Marcellus Rebelo de Sousa, pointing out, however, that his grandchildren came \"from an area of far-off China relative to the one where the problem was most serious\".\nThe President of the Republic later emphasised that the coronavirus epidemic in China \"affects the economic activity of a very powerful economy and therefore affects the economic activity of the world, or may affect\".\n\"There may be some disturbances if there is a significant drop in production in an economy which determines a decrease in trade with other economies and therefore a slowdown in the world economy,\" he added, however, that \"it is less important than people's health\"\nYeah.\nCalling again to evaluate how the Portuguese authorities have acted to contain the spread of this new virus, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said that \"there has been a collaboration of several entities to prevent the arrival in Portugal, to react in the event of reaching Portugal, to monitor and respond to the challenges ahead.\"\n\"And deep down, we're all learning. Portugal is learning, all countries are learning,\"he said, concluding,\"So far, what has been going on in Portugal has been good for all of us, and let us hope it will continue\".\nAs for the National Health Service (SNS)'s response to possible cases of infection with the new coronavirus that would arise, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa expressed confidence, praising his way of acting.\nAccording to the head of state, \"people believe in the NHS and the exceptional capacity of SNS professionals, which is a resilience and, at the same time, a rapid response to difficult and unexpected challenges that always amazes because it goes beyond what people often fear are the weaknesses of the NHS\".\n\"This has happened in multiple situations, this ability to respond, and is another reason to be very proud in the NHS, to defend the SNS, to thank and treat SNS professionals well,\" he said.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Reporting of the emergence of a new virus in a fish and seafood market in Wuhan, a city in central China, has caused international alarm. The memories of SARS and MERS are still fresh, two other coronaviruses. Both deaths that have arisen in the present century have caused many deaths before they were finally controlled. The new virus, which for the time being has no name but causes family symptoms such as fever and breathing difficulties and has already led to dozens of pneumonia, does not seem to have the same potential to kill. Of the infected people already confirmed, one died and was already severely weakened by other diseases. In more than 700 people who have had contact with patients, including health professionals, none seem to have been contaminated. However, The possibility of limited transmission within families is not ruled out, and this week the World Health Organisation has warned hospitals around the world that the new virus may spread, a fear fuelled by the massive displacement of people who will accompany the Chinese New Year celebrations until January 25th. In Portugal, the Directorate-General for Health said this Wednesday that there is no cause for alarm. The Express spoke to Raquel Guiomar, who recommends: \"Whenever someone goes to a hospital or a medical practice and has a respiratory infection, you should mention if you have taken any recent trips, in particular to China, where cases of this virus have been identified.\"\nWhat steps are being taken by the Ricardo Jorge Institute to address the potential threat of this virus? At the level of the laboratory diagnosis, which is the mission of this institute, we are following all the indications given by international networks, notably by the World Health Organisation, and we are establishing specific laboratory diagnosis for this coronavirus.\nYeah. The diagnosis recommended by the WHO was released on Tuesday and we are implementing it to make it quickly available. In addition to diagnosis, we are following other WHO guidelines. In all suspected cases, linked to the source of the outbreak in China, these patients and their products will be tested for the most common viral agents associated with respiratory infections- and of which the institute has a large number of diagnoses, including influenza, other human coronavirus, adenov rus for influenza, and also coronaviruses that were associated with outbreaks at the beginning of the two thousand years and now more recently, in particular MERS and SARS coronavirus. In all these suspicious cases it is also recommended to do a search for bacterial respiratory agents and even other agents, such as opportunistic fungi. So that will be the follow-up. The institute has also implemented a methodology that allows the genome of either bacteria or viruses or fungi in biological samples and will allow us to identify this new virus.\nWhat symptoms can cause a person to draw attention as a potential carrier of the new virus? What has been recommended, not only to clinics but also to patients, is that whenever someone goes to a hospital or a medical practice and has a respiratory infection, it should indicate whether they have made any recent trips, in particular to China, where cases of this virus have been identified. And, as in suspect cases of MERS coronavirus, it must be ensured that until the laboratory diagnosis, as a negative or positive case, is confirmed, the patient is in isolation. This evaluation is carried out by the Directorate-General for Health and by the doctors who perform this function. Initial information reported that it had not yet been confirmed that the virus could be transmitted between humans.\nYeah. Meanwhile, there was the case of that person who did not pass through the market in Wuhan, where the outbreak would have started, and yet contracted the virus. After all, can there be human to human transmission?\n",

What's the point if something happens (to us)...I want to request the government of India and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi-ji, please segregate us and bring us back home safely,' he said.\n\nAccording to an AFP report, people on board the ship are facing difficulty due to the quarantine measures, particularly those in windowless interior cabins and others who require medication for various chronic conditions.\nThe Japanese health ministry said on Monday that around 600 people on board urgently needed medication, and around half received supplies over the weekend, it said.\nMeanwhile, the operator of the ship on Monday vowed to refund all 2,666 passengers due to the onboard outbreak of the new coronavirus.\nCarnival Japan Inc., the Japanese branch of Princess Cruise Lines Ltd., which operates the ship, said refunds will be offered via travel agencies through which the passengers made their bookings.\nThe company will additionally cover all costs incurred by those quarantined aboard the ship since last Tuesday, when passengers were originally scheduled to disembark at Yokohama.\n'We hope this will help ease our guests' stress even just a little bit,' a company official was quoted as saying by The Asahi Shimbun newspaper.\nThe death toll in the coronavirus outbreak in China has gone up to 908 with 97 new fatalities reported mostly in the worst-affected Hubei province and the confirmed cases of infection crossing 40,000.\nThe coronavirus outbreak originated in central China's Hubei province in December last year.\n",

That was the lowest daily rise since Jan. 30 and came a day after epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan forecast the epidemic would peak in China this month before subsiding.\nHis comments gave some balm to public fears and to markets, where global stocks surged to record highs on hopes of an end to disruption in the world’s second largest economy.\nBut the World Health Organization (WHO) has likened the epidemic’s threat to terrorism and one expert said that while it may be peaking in China, this was not the case beyond.\n“It has spread to other places where it’s the beginning of the outbreak,” Dale Fisher, head of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network coordinated by the WHO, said in an interview in Singapore.\n“In Singapore, we are at the beginning of the outbreak.”\nSingapore has 47 cases. Its biggest bank, DBS (DBSM.SI), evacuated 300 staff on Wednesday after a case at head office.\nHundreds of infections have been reported in dozens of other countries and territories, but only two people have died outside mainland China: one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines.\nChina’s latest figures also showed that the number of deaths on the mainland rose by 97 to 1,113 by the end of Tuesday.\nBut doubts have been aired on social media about how reliable the data is, after the government last week amended guidelines on classification.\nFor graphic comparing new coronavirus to SARS and MERS, click: tmsnrt.rs/2GK6YVK\nFor Reuters graphics on the new coronavirus, click: tmsnrt.rs/2GVwIyw\nThe biggest cluster of cases outside China is on the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off Japan’s port of Yokohama, with about 3,700 people on board. Japanese officials on Wednesday said 39 more people had tested positive for the virus, taking the total to 175.\nOne of the new cases was a quarantine officer.\nThere was a happy ending in sight for another cruise ship, the MS Westerdam, which Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines had refused to let dock over fears one of its 1,455 passengers and 802 crew may have the virus.\nCambodia finally agreed to let it land, the Holland America Line said. Passengers have been whiling away time playing chess and doing puzzles.\n“The staff has tried to bolster spirits but you can only play so many games of trivia,” American passenger Angela Jones told Reuters in a video. “I’ve asked others who say they are napping a lot”.\nChina’s state news agency Xinhua called the epidemic a “battle that has no gunpowder smoke” and chided some officials for “dropping the ball” in places where it was most severe.\nThere was no lack of zeal, however, in the city of Chongqing where prosecutors brought charges against a man who strapped on firecrackers, doused himself with gasoline and held up a lighter to defy a ban on public gatherings.\nHe had planned a birthday banquet, Xinhua said.\nThe outbreak has been named COVID-19 - CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for the year. It is suspected to have come from a market that illegally traded wildlife in Hubei province’s capital of Wuhan in December.\nThe city of 11 million people remains under virtual lockdown as part of China’s unprecedented measures to seal infected regions and limit transmission routes.\nMeasures by the United States and others to curb visitors from China have offended Beijing, which says they are an unscientific, fear-based over-reaction. There has been a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment, some of it in ugly social media posts.\nA Xinhua commentary chided some Western media for “racist reporting” on the coronarivus.\n“These sensational and unfounded allegations from a few Western media outlets have turned a blind eye to the unswerving efforts and huge sacrifice China and its people have made,” it said.\n“Just as the H1N1 influenza outbreak in the United States in 2009 should not be called an ‘American virus,’ the NCP (novel coronavirus pneumonia) is neither a ‘China virus’ nor ‘Wuhan virus’.”\nWith companies laying off workers and supply chains disrupted from the car industry to smartphones, China’s economy is taking a big hit. ANZ Bank said first quarter growth may slow to between 3.2-4.0%, down from a projection of 5.0%.\n",

Australian shares were up 0.47%, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index rose 0.53%.\nEuro Stoxx 50 futures were up 0.05%, German DAX futures were up 0.08%, and FTSE futures were up 0.13%.\nThe number of new cases in Hubei, the province at the epicentre of the outbreak, was 1,068 as of Tuesday, down from a peak of over 3,000 new cases on Feb. 4, and the lowest number of new infections since Jan. 31.\nHowever, investors will likely need to see more evidence that the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has spread to 24 other countries and territories, is indeed receding before they take on more risk.\nConcerns that the virus will slow factory activity and consumer spending in the world’s second-largest economy have roiled global stocks and commodities, and many of these markets are still trying to regain their footing.\n“Evidence suggests the positive mood will continue, and we see some coordination in markets with oil rallying, base metals up and Treasuries coming under pressure,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.\n“It does appear there is increasing comfort that the virus won’t impact growth in a significant way, but I am not ready to buy risk assets yet.”\nU.S. stock futures rose 0.22% in Asia on Wednesday. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq inched to their second consecutive closing high on Tuesday.\nBenchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell further in Asia, pushing yields up to 1.6195%.\nTreasury prices declined on Tuesday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy is resilient.\nPowell also said he is closely monitoring the coronavirus in China, because it could lead to disruptions that affect the global economy.\nChinese firms and factories are struggling to get back to work after the extended Lunar New Year holiday. Some companies say they need loans and are laying off workers as supply chains for global firms from car manufacturers to smartphone makers ruptured.\nStocks in New Zealand rose to a record high and then pared gains. The local dollar rose 0.83% to $0.6460 for its biggest daily gain since December after the country’s central bank dropped a reference to the chance of further cuts, suggesting its easing cycle might be over.\nIn the commodities market, U.S. crude futures rose 1.36% to $50.62 a barrel, while Brent crude rose 1.74% to $54.95 per barrel on hopes that Chinese demand for oil will pick up once the flu-like virus is contained.\nSaudi Arabia wants global oil producers to agree a quick supply cut in response to the coronavirus, sources familiar with the kingdom’s thinking have told Reuters, which is another supportive factor for crude futures.\nIn the onshore market, the yuan inched higher to 6.9624 per dollar.\nThe yen traded at 109.83 versus the greenback, on course for its third day of decline, while the Swiss franc held steady at 0.9755 against the dollar.

Li added that small airlines such as Lucky Air and Okay Airways were looking to get acquired.\n“But the issue is the airlines looking to be bought were asking for a high price... after the outbreak, everyone is having difficulties, but small airlines may struggle more, so it’s possible for them to lower their asking prices,” Li said.\nPassenger traffic in China declined 5.3% in January from a year earlier, compared with a growth rate of 7.9% for 2019.\n“The coronavirus has had a huge impact on the civil aviation industry, which resulted in significant reductions in flight volume and could create new or spill-over safety risks,” Xiong said.\nThe CAAC hopes countries will lift virus-related travel restrictions as soon as possible, in line with guidance from the World Health Organization and International Civil Aviation Organization, said Liang Nan, another CAAC official at the briefing.\nFor international flights affected by the coronavirus, the CAAC, in communication with other aviation authorities, will strive to retain the rights and landing slots for airlines, Liang said, adding that flights would be restored as soon as possible when market demand returns.\n",

Whole bats are used in Paniki, including the head and wings.\n“It (the coronavirus) has not affected sales,” said bat seller Stenly Timbuleng at his stall in Tomohon, a city in North Sulawesi, south of the provincial capital of Manado.\n“In fact... sales continue. It is always sold out.”\nOn an average day, Timbuleng sells 50-60 bats and during festive periods, he can sell up to 600.\n“Bats are the favourite indigenous protein, particularly in North Sulawesi,” Indonesian culinary expert and author of half a dozen of cookbooks, William W. Wongso, told Reuters.\n“My favourite part is the wings,” Wongso added.\nGlands from the armpits and the neck of the bat are first removed to get rid of the bad smell.\nIt is then grilled or torched to get rid of the bat’s hairs before being chopped and cooked in a stew of herbs, spices and coconut milk.\nThe coronavirus is believed to have originated in a food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species,\nIn China, the virus has killed more than 1,000 and infected more than 42,700.\nThere are 319 coronavirus cases in 24 countries and territories outside of China, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese health officials.\nNone has been reported in Indonesia, but the outbreak has prompted many Manadonese restaurants in the capital, Jakarta, to take bats off the menu.\nFor Manadonese Jufry Mantak, the links between the coronavirus and his favourite dish have not put him off.\n“We have not found any (coronavirus) cases in Manado. Up till now, there are still many people eating these bats. Because bats are good, especially when cooked with coconut milk.”\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Growing insecurity over the coronavirus (Covid-19) epidemic in China may have a sharp impact on India's already-strained economy as industries fear that the outbreak could cripple their production activities.\nA recent report by Ind-RA said efforts to contain the virus outbreak within next three to four months will be critical as it would determine the fate of many industries around the globe, including in India.\nIf the virus is contained within the aforesaid time period, the impact on businesses in India and elsewhere will not be overgenerous, the report said.\nBut if no positive result comes within a few months, multiple Indian sectors could face major supply-side disturbances, triggering a delay in key manufacturing activities.\nThe Ind-Ra report goes on to highlight that the economic impact could be worse than what was seen during the SARS outbreak in 2003. At that time, the world was less dependent on China, now considered the biggest world's biggest manufacturing hub with a substantial contribution to the global GDP.\nChina now contributes to over one-sixth or over 15 per cent of the world's GDP and any deceleration in manufacturing activity could significantly impact worldwide growth.\nCommenting on the situation, Sunil Damania, CIO, MarketsMojo.com, said, \"For some reason, if China is unable to control it for six months, the impacts would be severe.\"\n\"It's very difficult to quantify as there are many moving parts. But it would have a significant impact and has the potential to drag down the world's GDP growth rate by at least 20 basis points for CY2020,\" he added.\nIMPACT ON INDIA\nThe Indian economy is already battling many headwinds including inflation, slow demand, and lower-income, which resulted in a sharp fall in GDP growth in 2019. Economic woes could amplify as many of the country's key sectors rely heavily on components or parts manufactured in China.\nWhile the government predicted India's growth for the next fiscal at 6.5 per cent, delay in supply of key essential commodities from China for a prolonged period could spill water on that optimistic forecast.\nSome sectors such as automobiles, consumer electronics, drugs and pharmaceuticals -- all of which contribute significantly to the country's GDP -- will bear the brunt of the supply curbs. Interlinked sectors will also suffer as a result.\n\"If the outbreak continues for longer than anticipated then the risk will not be restricted to a few sectors, but it can hurt the overall economy,\" Damania said.\nOver the past few weeks, concerned voices from the industry have discussed the issue in detail.\nSome industry experts said trade has already been mildly affected in India as supply chain issues start cropping up. The impact will start showing when firms run out of inventory, they said.\nLOWER JOBS, INFLATION AND MORE\nA delay in the supply of inventory would not only lead to lower production but will also lower sales volume. It could also lead to job cuts and higher inflation.\nFor instance, many electronic goods and phone manufacturers have already started facing the effects of supply slowdown as companies in China failed to restart key manufacturing activities. Major smartphone sellers like Xiaomi hinted at possible rise in prices as supplies of key components are already facing delays.\nA host of Indian smartphone manufacturers, who dearly depend on China for key components, are already indicating that their productions will fall if the supply disruptions continue. It could be a huge blow to India, which is the second-largest smartphone market in the world.\nSome analysts are expecting a drop in production and sales of consumer durables and smartphones while others fear that prices could go up in a situation where there is high demand but lack of supply.\nConsumer durables like television, washing machines and air conditioners -- all of which need critical components manufactured in China -- may also see a drop in sales due to lack of supply.\nWhat's worse is the fact that it could lead to higher inflationary pressure on India as China vendors have hiked prices of critical components amid the shortage. Higher inflation in times of slow growth could be disastrous for India and could severely disrupt plans to revive the economy.\nLike smartphones, automobile manufacturers also import a host of parts and essential components from China. It may be noted that more than 60 per cent of Chinese auto assembly production units have been directly affected by the coronavirus epidemic.\nA Boston Consulting Group report said the impact on the Chinese automobile industry will affect many other countries including India. A Fitch report said India's auto production activity could dip by over 8 per cent in 2020 due to the situation.\n\"China supplies India with between 10-30 per cent of its automotive components and this could be two to three times higher when looking at India's EV segment, which highlights just how exposed India's automobile manufacturing industry is to the slowdown of vehicle Chinese component manufacturing,\" it said.\nBut manufacturers in India have little choice apart from monitoring the situation and hoping for factories in China to fire up their assembly lines. Some Chinese factories reopened this week, but workers are in no position to resume activities with no solution in sight.\nAnother concern that India could face due to the virus outbreak in China is job cuts. With lower scope of production activities, some companies will be forced to lay off contractual labourers.\nThis could have a negative effect on India's declining income levels.\nLower manufacturing and production activity due to the virus outbreak could pull down India's Industrial output, which is also not in good shape. To sum it up, a fall in manufacturing output along with ticking inflation and supply constraints could worsen India's growth outlook further.\nAt the time of writing this article, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak stood at 1,488 with a sharp jump in the number of confirmed cases at over 65,000.\nThe situation in China remains critical with 121 news deaths on Friday while Japan registered its first death, the third fatality outside China.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "中国对冠状病毒（Covid-19）疫情越来越不安全，可能会对印度本已紧张的经济造成严重影响，因为工业界担心疫情可能会削弱印度的生产活动。\nInd-RA最近的一份报告说，在未来三到四个月内控制病毒爆发的努力将是至关重要的，因为这将决定全球许多行业的命运，包括印度。\n报告说，如果病毒在上述时间内得到控制，对印度和其他地方企业的影响不会太大。\n但如果几个月内没有积极成果，印度多个行业可能会面临供应方面的重大动荡，引发关键制造业活动的延迟。\nInd-Ra的报告进一步强调，经济影响可能比2003年SARS爆发时更严重。当时，世界对中国的依赖程度较低，中国现在被认为是世界上最大的制造业中心，对全球GDP贡献巨大。\n中国目前占全球GDP的六分之一以上或超过15%，制造业活动的任何减速都可能对全球经济增长产生重大影响。\nMarketsMojo.com首席信息官SunilDamania在评论这一情况时说：“由于某种原因，如果中国在6个月内无法控制局势，影响将是严重的。”\n“由于有许多活动部件，很难量化。但这将产生重大影响，并有可能在2020年将全球GDP增长率至少拉低20个基点，”他补充说。\n对印度的影响\n印度经济已经在与通胀、需求放缓和收入下降等诸多不利因素作斗争，这导致2019年GDP增速大幅下降。由于中国许多关键行业严重依赖中国制造的零部件，经济困境可能会加剧\n.\n尽管印度政府预测印度下一个财政年度的经济增长率将达到6.5%，但中国关键大宗商品供应长期拖延可能会影响这一乐观预测。\n一些行业，如汽车、消费电子、药品和制药，这些行业都对中国的GDP贡献巨大，将首当其冲地受到供应限制的影响。相互关联的部门也将因此受到影响。\n达曼尼亚说：“如果疫情持续时间超过预期，那么风险将不会局限于少数行业，但可能会损害整体经济。”。\n过去几周，业界关注的声音对这一问题进行了详细讨论。\n一些行业专家表示，随着供应链问题的出现，印度的贸易已经受到轻微影响。他们表示，当企业库存耗尽时，这种影响将开始显现。\n就业机会减少、通货膨胀等\n库存供应的延迟不仅会导致产量下降，而且还会降低销售量。这也可能导致裁员和通胀上升。\n例如，许多电子产品和手机制造商已经开始面临供应放缓的影响，因为中国企业未能重启关键的制造活动。小米等主要智能手机销售商暗示，由于关键零部件的供应已经面临延误，价格可能会上涨。\n许多印度智能手机制造商严重依赖中国生产关键零部件，他们已经表明，如果供应中断继续，他们的生产将下降。这可能对印度造成巨大打击，印度是世界第二大智能手机市场。\n一些分析师预计耐用消费品和智能手机的产销将下降，而另一些分析师则担心，在需求旺盛但供应不足的情况下，价格可能会上涨\n.\n电视、洗衣机和空调等耐用消费品都需要中国制造的关键零部件，但由于供应不足，这些耐用消费品的销量可能也会下降。\n更糟糕的是，这可能导致印度面临更大的通胀压力，因为中国供应商在供应短缺的情况下提高了关键零部件的价格。在经济增长缓慢时期，通胀率上升可能对印度造成灾难性影响，并可能严重扰乱经济复苏计划。\n与智能手机一样，汽车制造商也从中国进口大量零部件。值得注意的是，中国60%以上的汽车总成生产单位受到冠状病毒疫情的直接影响。\n波士顿咨询集团（Boston Consulting Group）的一份报告说，对中国汽车业的影响将影响到包括印度在内的许多其他国家。惠誉（Fitch）的一份报告称，受此影响，印度2020年的汽车生产活动可能下降8%以上。\n“中国向印度供应10%至30%的汽车零部件，从印度电动汽车市场来看，这一比例可能高出2至3倍，这突显出印度汽车制造业对中国汽车零部件制造业放缓的敞口，”该公司表示。\n但是，印度的制造商除了监测形势，希望中国的工厂能启动他们的装配线外，别无选择。一些中国工厂本周重新开工，但工人们在没有解决方案的情况下无法恢复生产。\n由于中国爆发病毒，印度可能面临的另一个担忧是裁员。随着生产活动范围的缩小，一些公司将被迫解雇合同工。\n这可能对印度不断下降的收入水平产生负面影响。\n病毒爆发导致的制造业和生产活动减少可能会拉低印度的工业产出，而印度的工业产出也不是很好\n. 总而言之，制造业产出的下降，以及持续的通货膨胀和供应紧张可能会进一步恶化印度的增长前景。\n在撰写本文时，冠状病毒爆发造成的死亡人数为1488人，确诊病例数量急剧增加，超过65000人。\n中国的局势依然严峻，周五有121人在新闻中死亡，而日本则是第一人死亡，是中国以外的第三人死亡。\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "\nFormula One’s Chinese Grand Prix has been postponed due to the recent outbreak of coronavirus in the country, organisers said on Wednesday.\nThe race, in what is an important market for Formula One, was originally set to be held in Shanghai on April 19, but the governing body FIA and Formula One said in a statement that they had jointly decided to postpone it.\n“As a result of continued health concerns and with the World Health Organisation declaring the coronavirus as a global health emergency, the FIA and Formula 1 have taken these measures,” the two bodies said.\n“The FIA and Formula 1 continue to work closely with the teams, race promoter, CAMF and the local authorities to monitor the situation as it develops.\"\n“All parties will take the appropriate amount of time to study the viability of potential alternative dates for the Grand Prix later in the year should the situation improve.”\nThe flu-like virus has killed more than 1,100 people and infected more than 44,000 in China after it first emerged in the central city of Wuhan late last year.\nA host of international sporting events have been cancelled due to coronavirus, including the all-electric Formula E motor racing series that abandoned plans for a race in the Chinese city of Sanya next month.\nSpeaking to reporters last week, Formula One’s motorsport managing director Ross Brawn had said the sport would look to reschedule the Chinese race rather than cancel it altogether.\nThe sport’s Chief Executive Chase Carey said fitting the race back into an already packed calendar with few spare weekends would pose a challenge.\n“At this point it’s tough to make too many specific plans when there are so many unknowns around it,” Carey told Reuters in an interview at a conference in the Azeri capital and Formula One host Baku.\nCarey also said the sport was keeping an eye on the spread of the virus outside China to other countries in the region such as Vietnam, which is set to host its first race on April 5.\n“The reality of today, in most other countries, the number of people affected is a handful,” he said. “But we don’t know what it will be in a week or two.”\nThe Chinese Grand Prix, which debuted in 2004, is an important event for Formula One, with the sport keen to tap into the opportunity presented by the country’s vast population and growing middle class.\nHosting fees also make up a significant portion of Formula One’s revenues, with some races paying as much as $40 million a year.\nA cancellation as a result could mean a financial hit for the sport’s US owners Liberty Media.\nThe last race to be cancelled was the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix, due to social unrest in the island Kingdom. But the country still paid the hosting fee despite the cancellation of the race.\nIf it cannot be rescheduled, the cancellation of the Chinese race will pare the calendar back to 21 races from the record 22 Formula One was set for this year.\nIt would also leave a four-week gap between new addition Vietnam and the returning Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort on May 3.\nAsked about the possibility of reviving races that have fallen off the calendar as one-off events to take China’s place, Carey said Formula One was evaluating all contingencies.\nThe time available is short, however, and organisers of any such one-off race would also likely expect their hosting costs to be underwritten.\n“We’re not going to do something that isn’t good for us or the teams,” said Carey. “We like the 22-race calendar (but) we’re fine with a 21-race calendar.”\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "一级方程式的中国大奖赛由于最近在中国爆发的冠状病毒而推迟，组织者在周三说。\n这场比赛是一级方程式赛车的一个重要市场，原定于4月19日在上海举行，但国际汽联和一级方程式赛车管理机构在一份声明中表示，他们已共同决定推迟比赛。\n这两个机构说：“由于人们对健康的持续担忧，加上世界卫生组织宣布冠状病毒为全球卫生紧急事件，国际汽联和一级方程式赛车已经采取了这些措施。”。\n“国际汽联和一级方程式赛车继续与车队、赛车手、CAMF和地方当局密切合作，在事态发展过程中对其进行监控。”\n“如果情况有所改善，各方将在今年晚些时候花适当的时间研究大奖赛可能的备选日期的可行性。”\n这种流感病毒去年底首次在武汉市中心出现后，在中国已造成1100多人死亡，4.4万多人感染。\n一系列国际体育赛事因冠状病毒而取消，包括全电动E级方程式赛车系列赛，该系列赛放弃了下月在中国城市三亚举行比赛的计划。\n上周，一级方程式赛车总经理罗斯·布朗在接受记者采访时曾表示，这项运动将考虑重新安排中国赛车的赛程，而不是完全取消。\n这项运动的首席执行官蔡斯凯里说，将比赛重新安排到一个已经挤满了人的日历上，没有几个周末的空闲时间，这将是一个挑战。\n凯里在阿塞拜疆首都和一级方程式赛车东道主巴库的一次会议上接受路透社采访时说：“在这个时候，如果周围有那么多未知因素，很难制定太多具体的计划。”\n.\n凯里还说，这项运动正在密切关注病毒在中国境外传播到越南等该地区其他国家的情况，越南将于4月5日举办首次比赛。\n他说：“今天的现实是，在大多数其他国家，受影响的人数屈指可数。”。“但我们不知道一两周后会怎么样。”\n2004年首次亮相的中国大奖赛是一级方程式赛车的重要赛事，这项运动渴望利用中国庞大的人口和日益壮大的中产阶级带来的机遇。\n托管费也占了一级方程式赛车收入的很大一部分，一些赛事每年的费用高达4000万美元。\n因此取消比赛可能意味着这项运动的美国老板Liberty Media受到了经济打击。\n最后一次被取消的比赛是2011年巴林大奖赛，原因是岛国的社会动荡。但尽管取消了比赛，中国仍然支付了主办费。\n如果不能重新安排赛程，取消中国站比赛将使赛程从今年创下的22场一级方程式赛车的纪录缩短到21场。\n这也将给5月3日在赞德沃特举行的新加入的越南站和归来的荷兰大奖赛留下4周的时间间隔。\n当被问及是否有可能恢复那些已经从日程表上消失的赛事，作为取代中国的一次性赛事时，凯里说，一级方程式正在评估所有的突发事件。\n不过，可用的时间很短，任何此类一次性比赛的组织者也很可能希望自己的主办费用能够得到承保。\n凯里说：“我们不会做对我们和球队都不好的事情。“我们喜欢22场比赛的赛程表（但是）21场比赛的赛程表没问题。”\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets across the world ticked higher on Friday, as investors bet that the damage to the global economy from     China’s coronavirus outbreak would not be long-lasting.\nEurope’s broad Euro STOXX 600  hit a record high, gaining 0.1% to mirror gains in Asia after a choppy start to the day.\nIndexes in London .FTSE and Frankfurt .GDAXI gained 0.1% and 0.2% respectively, with the former moving higher after AstraZeneca (AZN.L) shares turned positive. The drugmaker had earlier fallen 5% after it said it would take a hit from the coronavirus outbreak.\nIt was a similar picture in Paris .FCHI, which clawed back some early losses as Renault (RENA.PA) shares turned positive. It was last down 0.1%.\nRenault had dropped over 4% on its first loss in 10 years as the car company set a lower operating margin goal for 2020, a crunch year for its planned reboot alongside partner Nissan after a scandal surrounding former boss Carlos Ghosn.\nWall Street futures EScv1 pointed to a slightly higher open.\nChinese health authorities reported more than 5,000 new cases of the disease, with the National Health Commission saying  it had recorded 121 new deaths on the mainland on Feb. 13, taking the accumulated total infected to 63,851 people.\nInvestors said they thought the economic impact of the outbreak would not be as deep as feared, with some also finding succour in a spread beyond China that is not as rapid as feared.\nOthers have latched on to the possibility of further central bank stimulus measures in response to any slowdown. China’s central bank, for example, has already pumped liquidity into its economy.\n“Our base case is that the virus can be largely controlled by end-March,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote to clients.\n“The negative impact on the economy will be mostly confined to 1Q,” he wrote, predicting that growth would rebound from March on the release of suppressed demand and monetary and fiscal policy support.\nMSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was flat.\nEarlier, Asian shares had earlier risen towards their second straight week of gains, helped by hopes governments will make provisions to soften the impact on their economies from the coronavirus epidemic.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.1% for a weekly gain of almost 2%. China's blue-chip CSI300 shares .CSI300, meanwhile, rose 0.7%, having staged a stunning recovery to claw back 95% of their losses made after the outbreak.\n“China is already easing its monetary policy and providing more liquidity while more stimulus is likely,” said Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.\nIn its weekly number crunch of markets, analysts at BofA said there had been a record $23.6 billion pumped into bond funds over the last week and big inflows into almost everything else as well.\nThey also spotted that an interest rate cut in Mexico on Thursday had chalked up the 800th cut by global central banks since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. That works out roughly one every five days on average.\nStill, some did say they were dialling down bets on equities amid lingering uncertainty on how the crisis would unfold.\n“We have actually taken some money out of equities this week,” said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma Investment Management.\n“Markets have been overly focused on the good, and not giving a balanced view on whether the stimulus from China isn’t effective.”\nIn currency markets, traders had other matters than the cornoavirus on their minds.\nThe euro EUR=EBS slumped to another near-three-year low, with worries lingering about slowing growth in the euro zone and rising political uncertainties in Germany.\nEuro zone growth slowed as expected in the last quarter of 2019 as French and Italian GDP shrank but employment growth picked up more than expected, official estimates showed.\nThe euro did not waver on the numbers, having earlier fallen to as low as $1.0827.\nThe single currency last stood flat at $1.08390. It has lost 1% so far this week and is on track for its worst two-weekly performance since mid-2018.\nOthers market players noted growing demand for the U.S. dollar.\n“Investors will surely avoid Asia for the time being and will shift funds to the U.S., geographically the most separated from the region,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar .DXY hit a four-month high and was last at 99.115. It has risen 1.8% so far this month. The U.S. currency has been trampling everything in its path, including emerging market currencies.\nBrazil's real BRL= has hit a record low forcing its central bank to intervene to prop it up, while Turkey's lira TRY= has crumpled to a near nine-month low.\nOil edged higher and was on track for its first weekly gain in six weeks, backed by expectations that producers will implement deeper output cuts to offset slowing demand in China caused by the coronavirus epidemic.

Across mainland China, there were 15,152 new confirmed infections, bringing the total number to 59,805, it said.\n- Cases of coronavirus are not rising dramatically outside China apart from passengers on a cruise liner now quarantined off a Japanese port, a senior World Health Organization official said on Thursday.\n- Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated, accounted for 242 of them and confirmed 14,840 new cases, though it was amplified significantly by a switch to using quicker computerized tomography (CT) scans - which reveal lung infections - to confirm the virus.\n- The surge on Wednesday came a day after China reported its lowest number of new cases in two weeks, bolstering a forecast by Beijing’s senior medical adviser that the epidemic will end by April.\n- The sharp rise in the number of coronavirus deaths and infections unnerved world markets on Thursday, as traders halted the rally in stocks and retreated to the safety of government bonds and gold.[MKTS/GLOB]\n- China’s Huanggang, near the epicenter of the outbreak, said on Thursday that starting from Friday it would tighten epidemic controls including sealing residential complexes and only allowing essential vehicles on roads.\n- A woman has died from the coronavirus in Japan, the first such death in the country, the health minister said on Thursday. Two taxi drivers have also tested positive. Earlier, two other deaths from the virus outside of mainland China were reported in Hong Kong and the Philippines.\n- Forty-four cases have been detected on the Princess Diamond cruise ship quarantined off Japan’s coast. The Japanese health minister said on Thursday the end of the quarantine was targeted for Feb. 19, but elderly passengers with pre-existing conditions or windowless rooms would be allowed to leave earlier.\n- Cruise ship MS Westerdam docked in Cambodia after being denied docking rights in Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines over fears one of its 1,455 passengers and 802 crew might have the virus, even though none had tested positive.\n- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte rejected on Thursday Taiwan’s appeal to lift a ban on its citizens visiting the country, saying his primary concern was the safety of Filipinos.\n- Vietnam has quarantined a community of 10,000 people near Hanoi for 20 days, two local officials told Reuters on Thursday.\n- Hong Kong extended the suspension of schools until at least March 16.\n- Major shopping mall landlords in Hong Kong are offering cuts in February rent by as much as 60% to help tenants ride out the effects of the outbreak, which has emptied shopping centers and closed down tourist attractions.\n- Australia will maintain its entry ban on foreign nationals from mainland China for another week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday.\n- The number of confirmed cases in Britain rose to nine. The latest patient had caught the virus in China.\n- U.S. officials reported the 15th case of coronavirus in the United States on Thursday, saying the patient was among those who had been evacuated from Wuhan, China, and placed under federal quarantine at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.\n- The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Wednesday that any apparent slowdown in the spread of the epidemic should be viewed with “extreme caution”. “This outbreak could still go in any direction,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\n- The Red Cross called for an urgent exemption from sanctions on North Korea on Thursday to help prevent an outbreak.\n- North Korean media announced the quarantine period had been extended to 30 days, and that all government institutions as well as foreigners living in North Korea were expected to obey it “unconditionally”.\n- Chinese scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary clinical trial results are weeks away.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The number of new cases of a coronavirus in China fell slightly on Sunday, more than three weeks after the outbreak's epicenter was locked down, and a Chinese tourist died from the virus in France, the first fatality in Europe.\nThe coronavirus, thought to have emerged at a wildlife market in the central Chinese province of Hubei, has presented the ruling Communist Party with the huge challenge of halting its spread while at the same time minimizing damage to the world's second-largest economy.\nBeijing's latest figures showed 68,500 cases of the illness and 1,665 deaths, most of them in Hubei.\nThe National Health Commission on Sunday reported 2,009 new cases, down from 2,641 the previous day, and 142 new deaths, just one lower than the 143 the previous day. All but four of the new deaths were in Hubei.\nThe province and its capital, Wuhan, have been virtually sealed off and locked down since Jan. 23, with schools, offices and factories shut and most travel suspended.\nThe virus is believed to have an incubation period of 14 days which would appear to indicate it has been spreading since the lockdown was imposed.\n\"China should strengthen the unified leadership of efforts to control the epidemic,\" President Xi Jinping said in comments reported by the Xinhua news agency.\nOutside mainland China, there have been about 500 cases in some two dozen countries and territories, with four deaths - in Japan, Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, the Philippines and now France.\nIn the French case, an 80-year-old Chinese man died at a Paris hospital of a lung infection due to the flu-like virus, authorities said on Saturday.\n\"We have to get our health system ready to face a possible pandemic propagation of the virus, and therefore the spreading of the virus across France,\" said Health Minister Agnes Buzyn.\nRobin Thompson, an expert in mathematical epidemiology at Britain's University of Oxford, said that with nearly 50 cases in Europe, a death was not surprising.\n\"The most important thing to point out, however, is that there still hasn't been sustained person-to-person transmission in Europe,\" he said.\n'LACK OF URGENCY'\nAfter an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China urgently needs to get back to work. But some cities remain in lockdown, streets are deserted, employees are nervous, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country.\nThose returning to Beijing from the holiday have been ordered to undergo a 14-day self-quarantine to prevent the spread of the virus.\nMany factories are yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond for everyone from smartphone makers to car manufacturers.\nWhile there has been some hope expressed this week that the disease may be peaking in China, numbers keep rising and a trend has been hard to discern, especially after a reclassification that widened the definition of cases.\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was impossible to tell where the epidemic will spread.\n\"We are concerned by the continued increase in the number of cases in China,\" Tedros told the Munich Security Conference in Germany. \"We are concerned by the lack of urgency in funding the response from the international community.\n\"Most of all, we are concerned about the potential havoc this virus could wreak in countries with weaker health systems.\"\nKNOCKING GROWTH\nThe biggest cluster outside China has been on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, quarantined off Japan's Yokohama. Out of about 3,700 passengers and crew on board, 285 people have tested positive and been sent to hospital.\nThe United States said on Saturday it plans to send an aircraft to pick up American passengers and take them back home where they face another two weeks of isolation \"out of an abundance of caution\". Hong Kong said on Sunday it plans to do the same for some 330 of its residents.\nAnother cruise ship, the MS Westerdam, finally docked in Cambodia on Thursday after being rejected by ports in several other countries and territories.\nThe ship was believed to be free of the virus but an 83-year-old American woman from it tested positive on landing in Malaysia, health authorities there said.\nThe sickness, now officially labeled Covid-19, has killed about 2% of those infected. Cases have spread faster than other respiratory viruses this century.\nThe economic ripple effects go far beyond China.\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the coronavirus might knock two- to three-tenths of a percent off US growth in the first quarter.\nThe sporting world has suffered too.

The city of 11 million people, where the virus first appeared last year, is under virtual lockdown.\nChinese officials have said the apparent slowdown in infection rates is evidence the flu-like virus is being brought under control but global health officials say it is still to early to predict how the epidemic will play out.\nThe head of a leading hospital in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, died of the disease on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to have succumbed to the disease, known as COVID-19.\nChinese state media reported that Hubei would adopt more forceful measures to find patients with fever to help contain the epidemic, on top of steps already taken to isolate the province.\nThe province will check records of all fever patients who have visited doctors since Jan. 20, and people who have bought over-the-counter cough and fever medications at both brick-and-mortar and online drug stores, Xinhua reported, citing a notice by the province’s epidemic control headquarters.\nThe World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergencies programme chief, Mike Ryan, said China had success with “putting out the fire” first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday were monitored.\n“Right now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the correct one,” Ryan said.\nThe number of new cases in mainland China excluding Hubei has now fallen for 15 straight days. The number of new infections ex-Hubei totalled 56 on Feb. 18, down from a peak of 890 on Feb 3.\nThe biggest cluster of infections outside of China is on a cruise ship in quarantine off Japan, where more than 540 out of 3,700 passengers and crew have tested positive.\nAround 500 passengers were set to disembark on Wednesday, although those sharing a room with people testing positive would have to stay on board longer, Japanese media and officials said. Many of those infected have already been transferred to hospitals. About half the passengers are Japanese.\nA jet brought seven people from the ship to South Korea on Wednesday and Australia is expected to evacuate more than 200 of its citizens from the ship later in the day.\nThe United States evacuated about 400 citizens from the Diamond Princess on Sunday, while Britain, Canada, Hong Kong, Italy and Taiwan have plans to repatriate passengers.\nOutside China, there have been 827 cases of the disease, and five deaths, according to a Reuters count based on official statements.\nDespite global concerns about the economic impact of the disease, China’s ambassador to the European Union said on Tuesday this would be “limited, short-term and manageable” and that Beijing had enough resources to step in if needed.\nChinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020 despite the epidemic.\nIn a vote of confidence that the virus would not inflict lasting long-term damage on China’s economy, a source said a Chinese fund attracted about 120 billion yuan ($17.1 billion) of subscriptions on Tuesday, 20 times the target.\nThe mutual fund, which can invest up to 95% of assets in stocks, aimed to raise 6 billion yuan, but the marketing campaign was cut short by the outpouring of interest.\nEven so, the short-term impacts are playing havoc with trade and business around the world.\nBritain’s biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks because of the coronavirus.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in said the economy there was in an emergency situation and required stimulus as the epidemic had disrupted demand for South Korean goods such as cars, computer chips and smartphones.\nData this week from Japan and Singapore indicated those economies were on the brink of recession.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING (Reuters) - It was a late afternoon on a blue-sky day in Jiujiang, a city that borders Hubei, the central Chinese province worst hit by the coronavirus.\nWe were riding in our taxi along a main road en route to our next destination, a large bridge over the Yangtze river, which we heard had been shut down by a checkpoint as transport links with Hubei were all but severed.\nThen we noticed a police car driving alongside us. A voice over the car’s loudspeaker ordered our driver to pull over.\nSo began what became a routine of questionings and brief detentions by local officials during a 12-day reporting trip around the border regions of Hubei as we set out to document how lives of people there had been disrupted by the epidemic.\nOn the roadside, a police officer checked our press passes and passports. Then another came to check, and another after that. Eventually, we were told to leave our taxi. There were questions about our reporting plans.\n(GRAPHIC: Reporting on the edge of China's virus lockdown - here)\n“This is a special time,” one of the officers said, repeating a phrase we heard throughout our reporting.\nIn one instance, we encountered a 50-year-old mother from Hubei who pleaded with officials to allow her 26-year-old daughter to cross a checkpoint on the Yangtze to seek chemotherapy treatment for her leukemia because the hospitals in Wuhan were overwhelmed by the virus. They were eventually allowed to cross.\nEverywhere we went, our presence as journalists attracted attention.\nFriends and family worried about the dangers of the coronavirus and sent us concerned messages as we traveled. But steps to safeguard our own health were relatively straightforward. We took precautions, such as always wearing a mask, carrying hand sanitizer and wearing full protective suits, gloves and goggles in higher risk areas.\nThe more immediate challenge was navigating the questions and restrictions from Chinese officials so that we could get close enough to tell the stories of people affected by the epidemic and the government’s response.\nFor nearly two weeks, we were stopped and questioned at roadsides, train stations and hotels.\nLocals sometimes called the police on us – obvious foreigners – when they saw us on the street. Hotel staff reported on our movements. They are required to disclose when foreign journalists check in. Police and other officials came to our hotel at all hours.\nAt one point, one of us was locked in a train station for over an hour for having taken pictures of medical workers taking the temperature of arriving passengers. We were told to delete the images as a matter of state security.\nOn our last night in Anhui province, as we prepared to return to Beijing and begin a two-week quarantine at home, five officials  appeared to keep one of us from stepping out of our hotel to meet a food delivery driver.\nWuhan remains under a virtual lockdown. China’s National Health Commission confirmed 70,548 coronavirus cases and 1,770 deaths from the outbreak across the country, mostly in Hubei, as of Monday.\n",

The virus has jumped to about 30 countries and territories, with some three dozen deaths outside China, according to a Reuters tally.\nWorsening infections in Iran, Italy and South Korea are of particular concern, world health officials said. South Korea and Italy stepped up emergency measures to help curb the virus’ global spread.\nBelieved to have originated from wildlife in Wuhan city late last year, the flu-like disease has infected 80,000 people and killed close to 2,700 in China. But the World Health Organization (WHO) said the outbreak there has been declining since Feb. 2.\nDr. Nancy Messonnier, an official at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told reporters that data on the virus’ spread over the past week had heightened the agency’s expectations of transmission within the United States.\nDisruption to everyday life might be severe, she cautioned.\nWhile saying the immediate risk from the coronavirus in the United States remained low, another top CDC official, Dr. Anne Schuchat, said it was no longer a question of if the virus would become a global pandemic. It’s a question of when and how many people will be infected.\nThe Dow and S&P 500 tumbled 3% on Tuesday in their fourth straight day of losses as investors struggled to gauge the virus’ economic impact.\nIran’s outbreak, amid mounting US sanctions pressure, threatens to leave it further cut off. Several countries suspended flights and some of its neighbors closed their borders, while Oman’s Khasab port halted imports and exports with Iran.\nIt is an uninvited and inauspicious visitor. God willing we will get through ... this virus, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a televised speech.\nIran’s deputy health minister and a member of parliament were among those infected.\nAfghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait Bahrain and Oman this week reported their first cases, all in people who had been to Iran. Bahrain said it now has 24 confirmed cases.\nIran canceled concerts and soccer matches nationwide, and schools and universities closed in many provinces. Many Iranians took to social media to accuse authorities of concealing facts.\nTehran says US sanctions are hampering its response to the coronavirus by preventing imports of masks and medicines.\nThere is still hope\nA top WHO expert urged countries to step up preparations.\nThink the virus is going to show up tomorrow, Bruce Aylward, head of the joint WHO-Chinese mission on the outbreak, told reporters on his return to Geneva. If you don’t think that way, you’re not going to be ready.\nUS Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on Tuesday asked a Senate subcommittee to approve $2.5 billion in funding to expand surveillance systems for the virus, help development of vaccines and boost stockpiles of protective equipment.\nIn South Korea, which has the most coronavirus cases outside China with 977 infections and 10 deaths, authorities were testing all the estimated 215,000 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.\nThe country’s outbreak is believed to have begun in the city of Daegu with a 61-year-old woman who is a member of its congregation.\nThere was misery too for 34 South Korean newlyweds whose honeymoons on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius became a holiday from hell after they were put in isolation.\nTourism, sport and culture impacted\nIn Europe, Italy is the front line with more than 280 cases, as the outbreak is spreading from its origins in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto.\nItaly’s health minister, Roberto Speranza, said neighboring countries had agreed not to close their borders, calling such a step disproportionate ... at this time.\nBut airlines began restricting flights to Italy, prices of protective gear skyrocketed, a planned shoot in the country for Tom Cruise’s seventh Mission: Impossible movie was postponed, Milan cathedral was closed and the Venice carnival canceled.\nSwitzerland, Austria, and Romania reported their first cases, all in people who had been to Italy. Algeria and Croatia also recorded their first infections.\nSpain reported its first case on the mainland, a woman from Barcelona who had also visited northern Italy, while a four-star hotel on Tenerife was in lockdown after a couple tested positive there.\nChina reported a rise in new cases in Hubei province, the outbreak’s epicenter. But excluding those, it had just nine new infections on Monday, its fewest since Jan. 20.\nBeijing said restrictions on travel and movement that have paralyzed activity in the world’s second-largest economy should begin to be lifted.\nIn an example of the outbreak’s global ripple effects, experts said travel restrictions introduced uncertainty in the timeline for Apple’s introduction of new iPhone models later this year since engineers would normally be in Asia now ironing out assembly processes.\n",

There were no confirmed cases in the city but de Blasio announced plans to provide up to 1,200 hospital beds if needed.\nU.S. stock markets fell for the fifth consecutive day on investors’ alarm about the respiratory disease spreading.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed an infection of the new coronavirus in California in someone who had not traveled outside the United States or been exposed to a person known to have the virus, a first for the country. How the person was infected was not known.\nAt the White House, Trump said he was not ready to institute new travel restrictions for countries such as South Korea and Italy that are dealing with outbreaks - although he could not rule it out. The State Department raised its travel alert level for South Korea and urged Americans to reconsider going there.\nThe CDC has advised Americans to not visit China and South Korea, and on Wednesday stepped up travel warnings for Iran, Italy and Mongolia.\n“The risk to the American people remains very low,” Trump said, flanked by Pence and public health officials.\nHe said the spread of the virus in the United States was not “inevitable” and then went on to say: “It probably will, it possibly will. It could be at a very small level, or it could be at a larger level. Whatever happens we’re totally prepared.”\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, said that while the virus was contained in the United States, Americans must prepare for a potential outbreak as transmissions spread outside of China.\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the United States has 59 coronavirus cases, including 42 American passengers repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan.\n“We have to be alert to the possibility of a pandemic,” Peter Marks, director of the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in an interview.\nGlobal stock markets have slumped in recent days due to worries over a prolonged disruption to supply chains and economies from the virus, which has infected about 80,000 people and killed nearly 3,000, mostly in China.\nU.S. stocks turned lower in afternoon trading - the S&P 500 index fell for a fifth straight day and the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI ended down 123.77 points, or 0.46%. [.N]\nTrump, who is running for a second term in the November election, has been increasingly alarmed by the drop in U.S. stock markets, which he considers a barometer of the health of the American economy and sees as important to his re-election.\nHe told reporters at the White House that fears of the coronavirus had hurt the stock markets. But he also blamed the Democratic presidential candidates for spooking investors.\n“I think the financial markets are very upset when they look at the Democrat candidates standing on that stage making fools out of themselves,” Trump said in reference to debates among the Democratic contenders vying for the right to challenge him.\nEarlier in the day, Trump accused two cable TV news channels, CNN and MSNBC, of presenting the danger from the virus in as bad a light as possible and upsetting financial markets.\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, on Wednesday dismissed Trump’s assertion in India that the coronavirus was under control at home.\n“I don’t think the president knows what he’s talking about, once again,” she told reporters.\nAsked about her comment, Trump responded: “I think Speaker Pelosi’s incompetent.”\nTrump is seeking $2.5 billion from Congress to boost the government’s virus response, an amount Democrats said falls far short of what is needed. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called for $8.5 billion to prepare.\n“We’re going to spend whatever is appropriate,” Trump said.\nA congressional source said the Democratic-controlled House would attempt to advance a coronavirus emergency funding bill before the next recess, scheduled to begin on March 12.\n",

[L3N2AO07M]\n“The Trump administration continues to take the spread of the COVID-19 Coronavirus Disease very seriously. Today, the administration is transmitting to Congress a $2.5 billion supplemental funding plan to accelerate vaccine development, support preparedness and response activities and to procure much needed equipment and supplies,” said Rachel Semmel, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget.\nThe money will be used for therapeutics, vaccine development and the stockpiling of personal protective equipment such as masks, the White House said.\nOf the $2.5 billion request, $1.5 billion represents new funding. The rest would come from funds already budgeted by Congress, such as unused money to fight the Ebola virus. The administration requires congressional approval to redirect that money to fight the coronavirus.\nHouse of Representatives Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, a Democrat, said in a statement the Trump administration’s funding request was “woefully insufficient to protect Americans from the deadly coronavirus outbreak.”\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said late on Monday that the supplemental funding requested by Trump is “undersized” and “completely inadequate to the scale of this emergency”.\n“The House will swiftly advance a strong, strategic funding package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis,” Pelosi said in a statement.\nThe United States has not seen the virus spread through its communities the way that China and other countries have experienced, but health officials are preparing for the possibility even as Americans affected so far have been quarantined.\nThere have been 53 confirmed U.S. cases of the new coronavirus so far - 14 in people diagnosed in the United States and 39 among Americans repatriated from the outbreak’s epicenter of Wuhan, China, and from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nU.S. health officials have warned that cases among  repatriated citizens will likely increase.\nThe CDC warned Americans on Monday to avoid travel to South Korea because of the virus.\n“We have aggressively worked to combat the spread of this virus, tried to prevent it as best we could from coming into this country,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters earlier on Monday.\nTrump has been at odds with his own White House advisers over China’s coronavirus response. He has sought to downplay the impact of the virus, saying it could fade in April with warmer  weather - something health experts said is unknown.\nTrump has praised the work of Chinese President Xi Jinping, even as his advisers have questioned the reliability of the information Beijing has shared on the virus and expressed frustration over its reluctance to accept U.S. expertise in combating it.\nThe Trump administration is also grappling with where to send Americans evacuated from the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the virus after backing off plans to quarantine them in a federal facility in Alabama.\nIn a statement on Monday, HHS cited a “rapidly evolving situation,” but said the Alabama center was “not needed at this time” and that it was looking for alternatives.\n",

The answer is apparently, yes,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, who was not involved in the study.\nChina has reported a total of 75,567 cases of the virus known as COVID-19 to the World Health Organization (WHO) including 2,239 deaths, and the virus has already spread to 26 countries and territories outside of mainland China.\nResearchers have reported sporadic accounts of individuals without any symptoms spreading the virus. What’s different in this study is that it offers a natural lab experiment of sorts, Schaffner said.\n“You had this patient from Wuhan where the virus is, traveling to where the virus wasn’t. She remained asymptomatic and infected a bunch of family members and you had a group of physicians who immediately seized on the moment and tested everyone.”\nAccording to the report by Dr. Meiyun Wang of the People’s Hospital of Zhengzhou University and colleagues, the woman traveled from Wuhan to Anyang on Jan. 10 and visited several relatives. When they started getting sick, doctors isolated the woman and tested her for coronavirus.

Airlines are flying blind into a crisis of unknown severity and duration.\nIAG, which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, usually gives an earnings forecast at this time of year but said the uncertainty of the impact and duration of coronavirus meant it could not give accurate profit guidance at this stage.\n“It’s a rapidly changing situation,” Chief Executive Willie Walsh told reporters on Friday. “I wouldn’t call it unprecedented. We have seen other challenges for the industry.”\nBritish Airways has in recent days canceled flights to and from Italy, Singapore and South Korea, after it suspended all direct flights to China in January. IAG said further cancellations would follow in the coming days.\nBritish budget airline easyJet (EZJ.L) also warned on Friday that it had seen “significant” softening of demand for travel to Italy and other European markets and would cancel flights and cut costs. Finland’s Finnair (FIA1S.HE) also warned of a significant fall in profit.\nThe rapid spread of coronavirus has sent shockwaves through the global economy, hammering corporate supply chains, curbing travel, cancelling conferences and sporting events, and wiping tens of billions of pounds off financial markets.\nShare prices were on track for their worst week since the global financial crisis in 2008 and IAG’s is down 25% since the middle of January. On Friday it fell a further 8% to 474 pence.\nThe outbreak in Italy over the last week has brought new disruption to short-haul European travel but Walsh said IAG, with its strong balance sheet, was well-placed to withstand it.\n“I’m very confident that we’ll navigate our way through these challenges,” said Walsh, overseeing his last quarterly results announcement before new boss Luis Gallego takes over on March 26.\nBernstein analyst Daniel Roeska backed Walsh’s thinking: “We are also confident that a downturn would reveal the strength of the IAG model.”\nIAG said it was cutting costs and implementing revenue initiatives, which included looking at all discretionary spending, to help it weather the storm. That’s in line with moves by Germany’s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and Amsterdam-based KLM which have both cut costs in recent days.\nIAG said flight cancellations due to falling demand would hit its 2020 capacity growth though Walsh said it could start adding capacity if other airlines fail and that the group was in a strong position to benefit from any recovery.\nThe company also said its acquisition of Air Europa remained on track for completion later this year and was not affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\nFor 2019, IAG reported a 5.7% drop in operating profit to 3.285 billion euros, slightly ahead of a downgraded forecast of 3.27 billion euros it gave in September when it said a pilots strike would result in a 215 million euros hit.\n",

The number of aircraft on the ground for repair would fall to a single-digit by end of the second quarter, in line with forecasts, he said.\nRolls reported a 852 million pound ($1.1 billion) operating loss for 2019, largely due to a 1.4 billion pound charge for the Trent 1000. Excluding that charge, core underlying profit rose 25% to 810 million pounds.\nCash flow increased to 911 million pounds, led by higher profit and 173 million pounds worth of Trent 1000 insurance receipts.\nEast said Rolls delivered a record 510 widebody aircraft engines in the year and secured about two out of three orders for new widebody engines.\n“Building on the strength of our performance into the end of 2019, we are looking forward to 2020 with some degree of conviction and confidence,” he told reporters.\nShares in Rolls, which fell to a three-and-a-half year low on Thursday, were up 4% to 624.4 pence at 0945 GMT.\nRolls, which also has defense and power systems businesses, said the coronavirus outbreak was likely to hit air traffic growth, but long-term trends remained intact.\nBritish Airways owner IAG and Finnair said on Friday the virus would hurt their profits.\nEast said the situation was “an unknown unknown”, and Rolls was not currently able to quantify any impact on its guidance.\nHowever, he said all of the company’s facilities were up and running, and its supply chain had not been disrupted, including from China, the source of the virus outbreak where suppliers were going back to work.\n“Delivery of widebody engines continues as normal,” he said, adding that in its power systems business trading in China was already returning to normal.\nHe said the disease would impact flying hours, noting that 20% of invoiced flying hours in 2019 touched greater China, but added the company would take measures such as cost controls to mitigate any hit.\n“But we are confident given our performance in the second half of 2019, ... so we think we are better placed than ever to deal with a situation like this,” East said.\nRolls currently expects core operating profit to grow by about 15% this year, with at least 1 billion pounds of free cash flow.\n",

PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) and Mastercard Inc (MA.N) have also warned of a possible hit.\nSeveral Wall Street analysts said they expect other technology companies with strong China presence to follow suit.\n“Given there seems to be weakness in the PC supply chain, it would seem highly likely to me that we hear something from Intel Corp (INTC.O),” Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said in a mail.\nAndrew MacMillen, an analyst with Nucleus Research, said PC makers Dell Technologies Inc (DELL.N) and Lenovo Group (0992.HK) could be seeing some difficulties.\nDell, the world’s third-biggest PC maker after Lenovo Group (0992.HK) and HP, will report quarterly earnings after markets close on Thursday.

It aims to quickly leverage domestic manufacturing when Chinese factories remain closed by raising import duties on semi-finished or manufactured products.\nHowever, India’s production capabilities remain limited for many of these items.\n“It’s tricky to increase imports at such a time. If the situation does not change quickly and prices of industrial components begin to rise, an increased import duty will have the opposite effect on both consumers and growth,” a senior official said.\nThe Confederation of All India Traders has warned that stuck shipments for basic commodities have started to quickly deplete available inventories at wholesalers and retailers, and that prices might rise if the situation doesn’t improve by mid-March.\nOn the other hand, industry bodies have also warned that importers haven’t been able to put in new orders since mid-January.\nChina is India’s largest source of imports with $70 billion worth of products reaching Indian markets from Chinese shores.\nDespite this, a significant share of Indian importers across a broad range of sectors have continued to rely on regular trips to manufacturing hubs in China to place orders for products.\nWith these visits now called off, importers fear they would lose out once the situation normalises and importers from other nations scramble to call in their own orders.\nDomestic industry has also been rattled by rumours of China shutting down one or major seaports from March 1.\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has led to a decline in the number of ships calling on major Chinese ports, including Shanghai and Yangshan, in January when port calls declined by 17 per cent, compared to the previous year, according to local statistics accessed by media.\nHowever, while other nations have decided to limit shipping from China, the Chinese government has not announced any diktat to close ports yet, senior government officials and diplomatic sources confirmed.\nChina is the largest container cargo handler in the world, processing 30 per cent of global traffic or around 715,000 containers a day in 2019, according to global financial market and infrastructure data provider, Refinitiv.\nThe International Chamber of Shipping recently stated that by implementing certain preventive measures for Covid-19, ports in China can continue to operate.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Kenyans are a worried lot. As the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread across the globe, there are increasing questions being raised about the measures - or more accurately, the lack of measures - the government is taking to protect the population.\nBy the beginning of March, coronavirus infections had been confirmed in at least 55 countries, including three on the African continent - Algeria, Egypt and Nigeria. While so far the continent has been spared a major outbreak, there have been dire predictions of the havoc the virus could wreak. In February, Microsoft founder Bill Gates warned that the coronavirus disease, known as COVID-19 officially, could overwhelm already creaking health systems and claim up to 10 million lives.\nDespite numerous false alarms, there is thankfully yet to be a confirmed case of the virus in Kenya. However, a sense of panic has been building, fed largely by a perception that the government has been slow in enacting measures to prevent the virus getting into the country as well as by a dearth of public information on what to expect once its presence has been confirmed. It was not until last week that the country established a National Emergency Response Committee to \"prevent, respond to and contain this emerging global threat\".\nMuch of the concern has centred on the continuation of flights arriving from China whose Hubei province is the epicentre of the outbreak. At the end of January, the national carrier, Kenya Airways, reluctantly suspended flights to and from Guangzhou, one of its most lucrative routes, following public pressure, including from unions.\nHowever, the government's decision to allow a China Southern Airlines (CSA) plane carrying 239 passengers to land at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on February 26 caused uproar despite assurances that the passengers had been \"screened on board, cleared and advised to self-quarantine for the next 14 days\".\nThe Law Society of Kenya went to court and obtained orders suspending all flights from China and requiring that the passengers of last week's CSA flight be rounded up and detained at a military or specially guarded medical facility until they are certified to be free of the virus.\nHowever, focusing exclusively on measures to prevent COVID-19 reaching Kenya is problematic.\nDr Ouma Oluga, who heads the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union, this week told the popular Sunday show, Punchline, that travel bans were counterproductive and ineffective. They incentivise countries not to declare cases for fear of economic repercussions and, given the global spread of the virus, restrictions on travel from one country could not guarantee that the virus would not arrive from elsewhere. Oluga cited the case in Nigeria, which originated in Italy, as an example of this.\nThis is not to say that travel restrictions and other measures to contain the virus and stop it spreading, such as tracking and quarantining those infected, are not important. As both WHO officials and Professor Benjamin Cowling of the School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong have noted, such measures, while not necessarily stopping the virus, do slow it down and give countries time to prepare. And this is where Kenya is failing.\nAs public angst and government efforts concentrate on trying to prevent COVID-19 getting to Kenya, little attention is being paid towards preparing the health system and the public. As Dr Oluga pointed out, the government is yet to disseminate materials from the WHO to help prepare health workers to deal with the virus and, so far, most have not received \"any training at all on dealing with dangerous pathogens\".\nA 2013 survey of the health system found that only 2 percent of medical facilities in the country were \"providing all services required to eliminate communicable conditions\". And there is little sign that this has improved. A study published in the Lancet journal in February noted that while Kenya had a moderate risk of importing the virus from China, it had amongst the lowest scores on the continent for the capacity to handle an outbreak. \"Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritized in countries [like Kenya] with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission,\" it concluded.\nThe lack of a public information campaign to educate people on what to expect and how to protect themselves is feeding the growing panic and fuelling anti-Chinese sentiment which was already on the rise over allegations of racism and fears of economic exploitation.\nPublic ignorance is reflected in statements such as that from a former vice president who recently attributed the fact that no African had been diagnosed with the virus to strong genes.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, doomsday scenarios being propagated on social media take little account of the fact that most of those who catch the virus experience only mild symptoms and that the overwhelming majority of deaths from the coronavirus have been among those aged 50 and above, a demographic that accounts for less than 11 percent of Kenya's population. Further, informationon how to prevent infection, for example by regularly washing hands and practising good respiratory hygiene, can and should be easily disseminated and would help calm jittery nerves. However, instead of focusing on providing accurate and timely information to correct false narratives, the government is now threatening to prosecute people making statements it considers \"malicious and alarmist,\" a move that will do little to convince already skeptical Kenyans.\nNone of this is meant to suggest that COVID-19 should not be taken seriously or that measures to prevent infected people getting into the country should be discontinued. However, rather than placing all its hopes on stopping the virus at the border, Kenya's efforts should now be geared towards preparing for its eventual arrival. Like much of the rest of the world, it has a window of opportunity to do this. But it is a window that is rapidly closing.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "肯尼亚人很担心。随着冠状病毒疫情继续在全球蔓延，人们对政府为保护民众而采取的措施——或者更准确地说，缺乏措施——提出了越来越多的问题。\n截至3月初，至少有55个国家确认了冠状病毒感染，其中包括非洲大陆的3个国家——阿尔及利亚、埃及和尼日利亚。虽然到目前为止，非洲大陆还没有爆发大规模疫情，但有可怕的预测说，病毒可能造成的破坏。今年2月，微软创始人比尔盖茨（Bill Gates）警告称，官方称之为COVID-19的冠状病毒病可能会压倒已经摇摇欲坠的医疗系统，夺去多达1000万人的生命。\n尽管有许多错误的警报，但令人欣慰的是，肯尼亚还没有确诊的病毒病例。然而，恐慌情绪一直在增强，主要是因为人们认为政府在制定防止病毒进入该国的措施方面进展缓慢，而且一旦病毒的存在得到证实，就缺乏有关预期的公共信息。直到上周，该国才成立了国家应急委员会，以“预防、应对和遏制这一新出现的全球威胁”。\n人们的担忧主要集中在从中国（湖北省是疫情爆发的中心）起飞的航班的继续飞行上。今年1月底，肯尼亚航空（Kenya airlways）迫于包括工会在内的公众压力，不情愿地暂停了其最赚钱的航线之一广州的往返航班。\n然而，政府决定允许一架载有239名乘客的中国南方航空公司（CSA）飞机于2月26日在乔莫肯雅塔国际机场降落，尽管有人保证这些乘客已“在机上接受检查、放行，并建议在未来14天内进行自我隔离”，但这一决定还是引起了轩然大.\n肯尼亚法律协会诉诸法庭，获得命令，暂停所有来自中国的航班，并要求将上周加空局航班的乘客围捕起来，关押在军事或特别戒备的医疗设施，直到他们被证明没有病毒。\n然而，仅仅关注防止COVID-19进入肯尼亚的措施是有问题的。\n肯尼亚医生和牙医联合会主席欧玛•奥卢加（Ouma Oluga）本周在受欢迎的周日节目《朋克林》（Punchline）上表示，旅行禁令适得其反，效果不佳。它们鼓励各国不要申报病例，以免造成经济影响，而且鉴于病毒在全球蔓延，限制一国旅行不能保证病毒不会从其他地方传播。奥卢加以起源于意大利的尼日利亚的案件为例。\n这并不是说旅行限制和其他控制病毒并阻止其传播的措施，如跟踪和隔离感染者并不重要。正如世卫组织官员和香港大学公共卫生学院的Benjamin Cowling教授所指出的，这些措施，虽然不一定阻止病毒，但确实减缓了速度，给了各国准备的时间。这就是肯尼亚失败的地方。\n由于公众的焦虑和政府的努力集中在试图阻止COVID-19进入肯尼亚，很少有人关注卫生系统和公众的准备工作。正如奥卢加博士指出的那样，政府尚未传播世卫组织的材料，帮助卫生工作者做好应对病毒的准备，到目前为止，大多数人“根本没有接受过任何有关应对危险病原体的培训”。\n2013年对卫生系统的一项调查发现，该国只有2%的医疗设施“提供了消除传染病所需的所有服务”。几乎没有迹象表明情况有所改. 《柳叶刀》杂志今年2月发表的一项研究指出，虽然肯尼亚从中国进口病毒的风险适中，但在应对疫情的能力方面，肯尼亚的得分在非洲大陆最低。”资源、强化监测和能力建设应在（如肯尼亚）等风险中等的国家中得到紧急优先考虑，这些国家可能不准备好发现进口病例并限制进一步传播。\n缺乏一个公众宣传运动来教育人们期待什么以及如何保护自己，助长了日益增长的恐慌情绪，并助长了反华情绪，这种情绪已经因为种族主义指控和对经济剥削的恐惧而上升。\n公众的无知反映在一位前副总统的声明中，他最近将没有非洲人被诊断出感染了这种病毒的事实归咎于强大的基因。\n另一方面，在社交媒体上传播的世界末日的情景几乎没有考虑到这样一个事实，即大多数感染病毒的人只会有轻微的症状，绝大多数死于冠状病毒的人都是50岁及以上的人，这一人口占总人口的不到11%肯尼亚人口。此外，关于如何预防感染的信息，例如定期洗手和保持良好的呼吸卫生，可以而且应该很容易传播，有助于平息紧张的神经，但是，不是集中精力提供准确和及时的信息来纠正虚假的叙述，政府现在威胁要起诉那些发表其认为是“恶意和危言耸听”言论的人，此举对已经持怀疑态度的肯尼亚人没有多大帮助。\n所有这些都不意味着不应该认真对待COVID-19，也不意味着应该停止防止受感染者入境的措. 然而，肯尼亚现在的努力不应寄希望于在边境阻止病毒，而应着眼于为病毒最终抵达做好准备。像世界上许多其他国家一样，它有机会做到这一点。但这是一扇正在迅速关闭的窗户。\n本文表达的观点是作者自己的观点，并不一定反映半岛电视台的编辑立场",

        "news_content_translate_en": "From Volkswagen and Audi to Daimler, Ford and Opel to Airbus: The Coronavirus pandemic is now also hitting flagships of industry with force. Tapes are silent for days or weeks.\nThis is partly justified by decreasing demand and disruptions in supply chains, but also by protecting workers from infections. \"The main goal is to slow down the spread of the corona virus as much as possible,\" said VW chief Herbert Diess.\nProduction stoppages are also likely to have consequences for suppliers of industrial giants, for example in mechanical engineering and chemistry, and for the pockets of employees, which are now largely dependent on short work. IG Metall requires financial subsidies for workers. \"Otherwise, the production workers in short-time work are threatened with losses in net wages up to 40 per cent,\" said union chief Jurg Hofmann on Tuesday.\nThe world's largest automobile manufacturer Volkswagen will now suspend production in numerous factories in China, the starting point of the pandemic. The planned production stoppages in the German VW plants due to the Coronavirus pandemic start this Thursday. The sites are then to temporarily suspend production for two weeks at the end of the late shift.\nThe VW-daughter Audi follows the example of the mother: she gradually downloads her works to the end of this week. In China, on the other hand, production had been progressively increased since mid-February, one speaker said. The truck manufacturer MAN, a VW subsidiary, is currently continuing production, but the company applied for short work. At Munich's VW competitor BMW, the works run regularly.\nFor the time being, many of the tapes are still silent at the Daimler car manufacturer because of the CoronavirusYeah. Much of the production in Europe will be closed for the first two weeks from this week, the group announced in the evening in Stuttgart. Both car and transport and commercial vehicle production were affected. By the end of this week the works will be shut down. \"With these measures, the company is doing its part to protect the workforce, to break the chain of infection and to curb the spread of this pandemic,\" it said. \"At the same time, this decision helps to prepare Daimler for a phase of temporarily lower demand and to secure the financial strength of the company.\"\nOpel is running the production down in its trunk plant, in which the middle-class car Insignia is installed. There was short-time work there before the Corona crisis, because the model sells only moderately. Opel is currently talking to the workers and the employment agency about the extension of short-time work, it said in an internal information from Monday.\nFord will hold the tapes from Thursday to the German sites in Cologne, Saarlouis and other locations in Europe, as the car manufacturer announced on Tuesday. The exception is motor plants in the UK. How long the production stop will last is still unclear, one speaker said. Short work by the end of the year had already been requested by the car manufacturer for the Cologne site in February. The company was initially unable to confirm whether this measure was also planned for other sites.\nAccording to its chairman, Hofmann, IG Metall supports temporary closures to protect production workers from the spread of the Coronavirus. Hofmann pointed out that many employees could continue to work in the home office. But for those who cannot, there must be financial compensationYeah. \"Here too, production workers must not be disadvantaged compared with other groups of workers who have the option of working on a mobile basis.\" In the large automobile factories, there are corresponding pay-as-you-go arrangements. It is now up to the employers'associations to regulate this across the board.\nGermany's mechanical engineers are concerned about the planned production stoppages in the automotive industry. \"As long as the workshops are not completely closed, our companies can theoretically continue to deliver the machines and plants ordered or carry out their service,\" said VDMA chief VolksVolksswirt Ralph Wiechers in Frankfurt. \"But the stronger the restrictions in our customer industries become, the stronger we are also hit as equipment.\"\nFor the chemical industry, which supplies paint and plastics for example, the automotive industry is one of the most important customers. The VCI does not yet have any production losses. However, the chemical industry is likely to be affected by temporarily paralysed factories in large corporations such as VW.\nIn recent days there have also been first confirmed cases of infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus in German VW factories, which can cause Covid-19 lung disease. VW was strongly criticised by the works council, many employees were not adequately informed and advised. The interruption on Friday will be too late.\nThe aircraft and armaments group Airbus temporarily ceases production in France and Spain, initially for four days, the company announced in Toulouse. Airbus is thus responding to the regulations adopted by the governments, such as the curfew imposed in France. The company now wants to quickly implement new safety and hygiene measures to restart productioYeah.\nThe situation is getting worse for Airbus competitor Boeing, who has already been hit: because of employees infected with the Coronavirus, health authorities would now have to decide on the further production of the aircraft manufacturer, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday (local time). The financial news agency Bloomberg, citing Insider, reported that Boeing was pressing the US government for short-term financial assistance for itself as well as for suppliers and airlines. Boeing refused to comment on both reports on demand. (dpa",

Thus, the European economy will suffer from the economic shock in China in the first quarter, there will be supply bottlenecks for the European and global economies, demand will also be dampened across Europe and globally, and liquidity bottlenecks for businesses are to be expected.\nStrictly speaking, the Covid-19 crisis will have a very large negative impact on the economy in the EU and the euro area, the Commission estimates. 2021 The economy will experience a substantial but not complete recovery. However, some of the direct negative consequences could be mitigated by swift and effective counter-measures taken by the EU and the Member States, according to an analysis by the Commission.\nThe EU Commission is planning a comprehensive package for this.

Although no games are to be cancelled, the games could take place without an audience in the stadium. According to Laumann, this is true for the Bundesliga Derby Borussia Munich against the 1st. FC Cologne on Wednesday. He added: \"If we now say quite clearly that we do not want to allow more (with) over 1000-people events in North Rhine-Westphalia, then this is a recommendation from the National Health Minister to the lower health authorities.\" They should decide. However, he was sure that there would now be a uniform implementation. \"In truth, it is like an order.\"\nThe World Medical Association also welcomed Spain's recommendation as \"absolutely right\". \"You cannot have football games with 35.000 visitors as if nothing had happened,\" said Frank Ulrich Montgomery, head of the World Medical Association, the editorial network of Germany (RND, Monday).\nAs in other European and world countries, Sars-CoV-2 is rapidly spreading in Germany. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) recorded 902 infections until Sunday afternoon, with not all evidence from the federal states already registered there. The majority of cases in Germany are North Rhine-Westphalia, Baden-Wurttemberg and BavariaYeah. In Egypt, for the first time on Sunday, a German citizen had died of Covid-19 lung disease. From which state the 60-year-old came and where he got infected was initially unclear.\nItaly, the country most affected by the Coronavirus in Europe, also took further measures: after the closure of large parts of the north, the Italian Government activated controls at railway stations, airports and motorways in the restricted areas. You can only enter or leave the areas of northern Italy in an emergency or for work reasons. This must be attested by a self-declaration, as the Ministry of the Interior announced late Sunday evening. You can fill out forms on site.\nIn Italy, there are already more than 360 deaths and 7300 infections. In order to get the crisis under control, the government had declared large parts of the north a restricted zone, including Lombardy with the Milan financial centre and the provinces of Venice, Parma and Modena. Around 16 million people are affected by the blockades.\nFrance decided to ban in principle events with more than 1000-people. The Minister of Health Olivier Veran announced in Paris after a meeting of the Security Council, but indicated that there would be exceptions. Until now, France had banned events involving more than five thousand people.\nIn order to protect against further spread of the virus, the Czech Republic introduces random checks for immigrants at the national border. Poland controls bus travellers from Germany at the A4 at the former border crossing Hennersdorf (Jedrzychowice) near Gorlitz.\nIn China, more 22-people died as a result of the virus. According to official information, the number of newly infected continued to fall to 40 cases nationwide. However, a high dark figure is suspected. To date, more than 3000-people have died of Covid-19 lung disease in China. About 8.735 infections have been detected, but more than 58.000 patients are now considered cured.\nIn South Korea, signs of a slower rise in infections are increasing. On Sunday, 248 new cases with Sars-CoV-19 were reported by health authorities on Monday. The total number increased to 7382. The number of previous deaths associated with the virus has been reported with 51.\nThe Coronavirus crisis also has a significant impact on the stock exchanges: Asia's Tokyo stock exchange broke into the week-end. The Nikkei index for 225 leading values dropped by more than 1000 points on Monday and thus for the first time in over a year under the psychologically important brand of 20.000 points. The background is growing concern about the impact of the new Coronavirus on the global economy. The mood was also aggravated by a fall in oil prices.\nWorldwide, far more than 100.000 people have been proven to be infected with the new Coronavirus, and according to experts, the dark number is much higher. There is no protective vaccination or special therapy to treat Covid-19 disease. Most of the infected have only a mild cold symptom with frostbite and sore throat that disappears within a few days, or no symptoms at all. Approximately 15 of 100 infected patients are severely affected, mainly elderly people or those with pre-existing diseases.\nAuthorities in many countries are currently adopting measures such as school closures and a quarantine for suspected cases. This does not happen because Covid-19 is a particularly dangerous disease, but to avoid an unbridled wave of infection that would, among other things, overload the health system. The aim is to extend the spread over as long a period as possible. In about a year, there could be a protective vaccine against the new pathogen. (dpa",

Otherwise, they see the supply of the population as endangered.\n\"More extensive testing of clinical health is medical nonsense,\" said the head of the Federal Medical Association of Cassation (KBV), Andreas Gassen, on Tuesday in Berlin. In order to reduce the spread of the viruses, the Leipzig Book Fair was cancelled. In Saarland and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, there were first confirmed Coronavirus infections. This is now proven in all the federal states except Saxony-Anhalt.\nIf anyone has a suspicion of the Coronavirus on their own, they should not immediately visit a practice, Germany's top cashier warned Gassen. Tests only make sense if someone has symptoms of upper respiratory disease and may have had contact with infected people. In any case, according to KBV, people who feared an infection of their own should first call the practice or the doctor's line 116 117. Because in most cases infections with the Coronavirus were mild.\nIf an infected person immediately visits a practice, it was also said that it could be temporarily closed by the competent health authority for disease protection reasons. Last week, 11.000 tests for the Coronavirus were carried out, but only 188 Sars-CoV-2 infections were detected until Tuesday morning.\nOn Tuesday, the Berlin Charite opened its own investigation centre for possible corona virus infections, in front of which people were quickly queuing up. The pilot project should be a model for other hospitals, said Medical Director Ulrich Frei.\nFrance confiscated protective masks. As regards stocks and current production, Emmanuel Macron, Head of State, informeYeah. The masks should be distributed to healthcare workers and citizens infected with the new Coronavirus.\nThe city and the region of Aachen deviate from the recommendations of the Robert-Koch Institute (RKI) on the Coronavirus to ensure the operation of the clinic. In case of an infection in the workforce in a station, employees without symptoms of illness are no longer quarantined as recommended by the RKI. Such a quarantine could paralyse entire stations, the crisis teams justified the decision. After a positive Coronavirus test on a nurse at the nursery station, the consequences had become clear: because the woman in the ICU had contact with 45 forces, they should have been quarantined for 14-day periods according to RKI recommendations. The clinic stressed that this would put an end to work in the ICU.\nThe city of Essen urges the organizers of events from 25 persons to collect the personal data of all participants. In the event of a later identified infection, it should be possible to identify all the others without delay.\nTwitter has called all its employees worldwide to work from home because of the Coronavirus threat.\nApproximately half of the 188 Sars-CoV-2 infections recorded from RKI to Tuesday morning have been reported in North Rhine-Westphalia. In addition, Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg are currently more affected. A virus-related death has not yet been recorded in Germany. Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) announced a government statement on crisis management at Sars-CoV-2 on Wednesday. A meeting with national health ministers is also planned.\nThe vast majority of the infected have no complaints or only cold symptoms that quickly subsidYeah. Heavier disease progressions, such as pneumonia, are developing up to a 15-percent, according to the world's previous knowledge. This often includes old people and patients with pre-existing illnesses. The isolation of those affected and the search for contact persons are carried out in order to slow down the spread of the virus as much as possible. This should maintain as much capacity as possible in the health system.\nOutside China, where the virus originated, South Korea is currently the most severely affected by Sars-CoV-2 following the official reporting. More than 4800-year-old infections have meanwhile been reported by the authorities, with at least 28 people dying of Covid-19. Northern Italy is particularly affected in the EU. According to civil protection data from Monday evening, more than 2000 infections were recorded in Italy as a whole, more than 50 of the infected died. In China, the number of officially registered infections was more than 80.000 on Tuesday, the number of deaths was nearly 3000. Experts, however, assume a high dark number.\nAccording to the RKI, around 90.900 people in 73 countries have been shown to be infected with the new Coronavirus worldwide. \"The situation is moving away from China and the rest of the world is increasingly affected,\" said Vice President Lars Schaade. Since Monday there have been officially 115 cases in China, in the remaining 72 countries 1700 cases.\nThe rapid spread of the new Coronavirus has unforeseeable consequences for European airlines. Several airline heads reported a sharp drop in booking numbers. Lufthansa chief Carsten Spohr stated that currently 23 of 200 long-range machines remained on the ground due to the virus crisis.\nCSU chief South wants to push through a stimulus package for the economy ravaged by the Coronavirus: \"This includes significantly lower energy prices and corporate taxes, but also investmenFDP chief Christian Lindner called on the government to put in place an \"anti-crisis package\" against the economic consequences of a Coronavirus epidemic.\nIn Norway, the cruise ship Aida Aura was initially stuck on Tuesday because two German passengers suspected Sars-CoV-2 infection.

        "news_content_translate_en": "After the US issued restrictions on Chinese state media, China ordered the expulsion of several US journalists in return. Employees of leading US media houses such as the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post are affected.\nEmployees of these newspapers, whose accreditations expired before the end of the year, would have to return their press credentials within ten days. That's what the Chinese Foreign Office announced on Tuesday. Because journalists'visas are linked to their press credentials, this is tantamount to expulsion. Those affected may also no longer enter the Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Zones.\nThe newspapers concerned condemned the measure. It was \"particularly irresponsible at a time when the world needs the free and open flow of credible information about the Coronavirus pandemic,\" wrote New York Times editor Dean Baquet. Similarly, the leading editor of the Wall Street Journal said: \"Confidential news and China were never more important.\" The expulsion was an \"attack on freedom of the press\". The chief editor of the Washington Post, Marty Barton, said the measure would \"only make things worse\".\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also criticised the move.\" I hope they will reconsider,\"he said. Compared to previous measures in the USA, freedom of the press is not restricted there. Journalists cannot be equated with propagandists. China, on the other hand, denied the world access to what was happening in the country, Pompeo said. Transparency, especially in times of crisis, was more important to the people of China than ever.\nIn early March, the US had adopted new restrictions on Chinese state media outletYeah. The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs set a maximum limit of 100 accredited employees for five Chinese press houses, including the state news agency Xinhua. Previously, this limit was at 160.\nIn addition, the US government is considering tightening visa restrictions for Chinese journalists in the future. When announcing the Chinese counter-measures on Tuesday, the Beijing Foreign Office called the US restrictions \"scandalous\", Chinese media were \"suppressed\" in the US.\nPreviously, the US had classified China's state media as \"foreign representations\". They were organs of the Communist leadership. The move would require five media companies, whose status now resembles that of embassies, to adjust to more frequent controls, the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced in February. Among other things, the media concerned in the US must report the names of their employees, ownership and personnel changes. The same restrictions now apply in China to the US newspapers concerned.\nThe quarrel could be caused by the expulsion of three Wall Street Journal correspondents for reporting on the outbreak of the new Coronavirus. The paper did not want to apologize for an opinion entitled \"China is the real sick man of Asia\". It was the first time in the recent history of the People's Republic that several correspondents of an international news organization of the country were immediately expelled.\nHowever, tensions between China and the US have recently escalated. Thus, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticised US President Donald Trump. This had called the new Coronavirus \"Chinese virus\" several times. The link between the pathogen and China is outrageous and amounts to stigmatisation, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Office said.\nHowever, Trump insists on this designation for Sars-CoV-2.\" It came from ChinYeah. That is why I think the term is very precise,\"said Trump at a White House press conference. It was not this name that was stigmatising, but alleged claims by the Beijing leadership that the virus had been brought to China by the US Army.\nA statement to this effect came earlier from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a spokesman for the authority speculated on Twitter. He \"did not appreciate\" this conspiracy theory, Trump said",

        "news_content_translate_en": "First, China's leadership had to be accused of being too hesitant about the outbreak of the Coronavirus. Then she basically shut the country down and imposed massive quarantines. Which led to the economy breaking in. Now China's leadership is trying to find a balance: take the virus seriously, but not at the expense of the economy. And she can't really do that either.\nChina's head of state and party Xi Jinping has already called on his compatriots to return to the production sites and resume their work at the beginning of the last few weeks. In regions where the risk is \"relatively low\", production is to be fully resumed, the decree states. The fight against the virus should be limited to preventing its introduction. Say: Checks and temperature gauges at railway stations, airports and shopping malls will continue to exist. Otherwise, life should return to normal.\nAnd even in areas with a'medium risk'people should resume their work and the authorities should only check'depending on the local situation of the epidemic' whether quarantine measures are still appropriate.\nApart from this call, the regions particularly affected by the Sars-Covid-19 Coronavirus, in particular the crisis province of Hubei, where the outbreak began and with almost 70.000 infected the number is by far the highest worldwide. These regions should continue to \"focus fully on control and prevention,\" Xi said.\nIn fact, almost half of all circles in China have not registered any infected at all. According to official figures, the Northeast and its heavy industry in particular have counted only a few infected. Nevertheless, economic life remained silent throughout the countrYeah. The purchasing manager index (PMI), a central index for the production of all Chinese plants, dropped below 38 in February; all under 50 points indicates a decrease in production. The value has never been so low since the introduction of Index 2005 in China. In the service sector, the index even dropped below 30 points.\nThe leadership had called for the virus to be combated and all officials had to stick to it, EU Chamber of Commerce President Jurg Wuttke describes the central government's actions in Beijing. For this, there had to be cuts, and the economy was hit: \"Now it is necessary to come down from this extreme again.\"\nThe central bank has already lowered interest rates for entrepreneurs, and the central government has announced further major investments in infrastructure projects. However, economic life is not exactly in flux.\nIn Beijing and Shanghai, too, the numbers with less than 500 infected have remained relatively low and have not increased in recent days either. However, there can be no question of normalising economic life. Traffic has been rebuilding on the roads for several days now, but most office towers and shopping malls have reopened. But residents say the shops are still empty. In Beijing's popular Sanlitun district, for example, few employees would be bored.\nThere is contradictory information about the resumption of production facilities. In the East Chinese high-tech city of Hangzhou, for example, the tech group Alibaba also sits here. According to official information, almost 95 per cent of the city-based companies \"have resumed their normal operations\". 85 Percentage of employees had returned to their jobYeah. It is said that around 65 per cent of large corporations and around 40 per cent of small and medium-sized enterprises have boosted production again.\nBut foreign companies report otherwise. They complain that most farms would continue to stand still. The employees were simply absent. After the Chinese New Year celebration, many of the thirty million migrant workers throughout the country had followed the call of the central government not to return to the industrial regions. Now Beijing is urging them to do just that. But for fear of the virus, they would stay in their hometowns.\nThis also stopped the problems in the supply chains. The companies lack important intermediate products. And the different regulations are also a big problem.\" The patchwork of contradictory regulations that the fight against Covid-19 has created hundreds of different areas of power that make it almost impossible to move goods or people in China,\"also complains EU Chamber President Wuttke. He expects that it will take weeks for economic life to normalise itself in the regions less affected by the virus.\nChina's Volkswagen Chief Stephan Wollenstein, who is also chairman of the German Chamber of Commerce for North China, describes the current situation as follows: on the one hand, the Chinese leadership wants to \"strictly maintain measures to prevent the virus\", but on the other hand, it is fighting for \"a return to economic normality\". Wollenstein speaks of a \"delicate balancing act with two important but divergent objectives\"",

She said she usually went to the hospital when she was not feeling well, where she was injected, and her feeling improved a lot the next day. But this time, even two injections didn't help. Wei went to another hospital, where he couldn't help her, so she decided to stay at home and take medicine.

The country's urgent appeal for the release of prisoners from prison and the isolated city - news of the world continues to shock. However, instead of uniting to face common threats, countries have found out who is playing with whom on the wheel. Claims involve not only strategic enemies, but also long-term partners and neighbors.\nChina is gradually recovering from the outbreak of the coronavirus - field hospitals are shrinking, cafes and restaurants are opening in big cities, The authorities have taken positive action on information. On March 12, foreign ministry spokesman Zhang Liqian said the U.S. military may have brought the virus into the country.\n\"Because of this audacious rumor campaign, Ambassador Cui Tiankai was summoned by the State Department. Chinese diplomats have tried to ease the situation and remind everyone to cooperate in the event of a pandemic. However, courtesy did not stop. Donald trap has been called sars-cov-2 Chinese virus several times on twitter. \" His political opponents saw a manifestation of racism.\nJiang Zelai, a CNBC reporter from China, injected oil into the fire. \"Kung Fu\" and \"UK flu -\" are the names of an official in the White House, she said on her microbloAbout\nThe owner of the oval cabinet himself explained that he only pointed out the origin of the virus. What are we arguing about? I just want to know where he came from: \"from China,\" the president told reporters. Beijing's remark is still irritating. According to the panel, the purpose of such remarks is to insult \"China\".\nChina has decided to restrict the work of major US media: the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post have also been sanctioned by time and voice of America. Publications are responsible for providing relevant departments with information about staff, funds, operations and real estate in China. In addition, some journalists must hand over their press cards and stop their press activities in the country.\nWashington has accused misinformation and other \"revisionist countries\" - Iran. They also believe that sars-cov-2 is a biological weapon of the United States. Secretary of state Mike Pompeii accused Tehran of concealing the scale of the epidemic He said that instead of focusing on the needs of his people and receiving sincere assistance, Iranian leaders lied to Wuhan virus in a few weeks. \"\nPompeii believes the Iranian authorities avoid taking responsibility for the failure of the fight against the Colorado virus. In Tehran, the aid provided by the United States has indeed not been evaluated or acceptedAbout Meanwhile, according to NBC sources, the French marine reserve refused to fight back against Iranian facilities because of an attack on a Western Alliance Base in Iraq. In this regard, Washington believes that Hizbollah, supported by Iran, \"kataib\". However, such a reaction could lead to \"looking bad in the eyes of world public opinion\" in the United States because of the complex situation of the spread of new viruses in Iran.\nThe country's health system is under great pressure. Due to coronavirus, some 85000 prisoners were released. President Hassan Rohani called on world leaders to help lift the sanctions so that the authorities can more effectively control the spread of infection. In this regard, Tehran has the support of Moscow and Beijing.\nThe development of a mutant vaccine has created tension between two transatlantic partners, the United States and Germany.\nIn early March, curevac Daniel manikkel, head of the German biotechnology company, met with Donald tramp and vice president Michael pens at the White House. \" We firmly believe that the medicine will be ready in a few months. \" Two weeks later, however, he was told he was leaving.\nSources from the government of the Federal Republic of Germany told reporters that the president of the United States tried to attract overseas researcherAbout According to welt am Sonntag, tramp has pledged billions of dollars to scientists if they agree to work in U.S. laboratories.\nBerlin's White House is suspected of being selfish, and German Interior Minister Horst zeehopher announced that Chancellor Angela Merkel would hold an emergency cabinet meeting, Include discussion of possible damage caused by curevac.\n\"It's not just a health crisis, it's a national security crisis,\" zeehfer said In her national speech on March 18, Merkel acknowledged that the German people had never faced such a serious challenge since the Second World War. It was emphasized that the health system of the Federal Republic of Germany may be the best in the world, but there is no vaccine for new diseases.\nIn the European Union, there has long been concern that Washington wants to develop European technology. A scandal broke out in February after Attorney General William Barr suggested that Americans think of a way, How to control the two largest European telecom companies - Ericsson and Nokia.\nThe current vaccine plot, which inherits a series of contradictions between the United States and Germany, began with Merkel's phone hacking in 2004About Similarly, the European Union springboard requires NATO to spend at least 2% of its GDP on NATO and other pain points, Alexander kamkin, chief researcher of the German Research Center of the European Institute of the Russian news agency, explained. \"One thing, if the prime minister is monitored,\" he said, \"is regrettable, but understandable.\" -Another situation is that in the context of global hysteria, when the security of the whole country is threatened, this is a completely different attitude. \"\n\"It looks like zeehopher just broke. The discontent of American imperialist messianism in many European countries has been aroused, \"concluded the correspondent of the news agency.\nConflicts are also intensifying in Eastern Europe. Lithuanians, for example, cannot cross the German Polish border to return home. Poland closed the border crossing and hundreds of cars lined up at it. Citizens of Latvia, Estonia and Ukraine are also trapped on the border. In protest, they blocked the road.\nThe negotiations were inconclusive. Hundreds of people will have to find other ways to go home.\nHowever, detours are also difficult. On Monday, 16 March, an incident occurred among Lithuanians: they arrived in Latvia by air and rented a taxi. At the border, they don't let cars because the driver is latvian. As a result, passengers had to walk to Lithuania with boxesAbout\nThe EU's hopes of providing assistance in the fight against the Colorado virus have also been lost, with people who have long sought \"Pan European homes,\" such as Serbia I don't want to draw any far-reaching conclusions right now, but we realize that without international or European solidarity, all of this is on paper. \" The head of state, Alexander vuccic, said sadly.\nHe criticized the European partners' actions and reminded them that when the European Union needed Serbian money, Brussels demanded changes in the bidding conditions so that European companies could obtain contracts. \" Unfortunately, Serbian money did not help. \"Thank you so much,\" trust me, I'll find a way to thank you\nAt the same time, Serbia's leaders called \"Chinese President Xi Jinping\" brothers and said he had sought support.\nOther countries also rely on Beijing. Xi Jinping promised to help Spain, while Italy has received the second batch of Chinese doctors. In addition to 60000 coronavirus tests, specific therapies, 9 tons of medical protective materials and drugs, China also provides traditional oriental medicine.\nCarnegie Zimmer Umarov, a consultant at the Moscow Center, believes that China's assistance to European countries may have different feelings。 While Italy adopted the belt and Path Initiative, France and Germany actively advocated the establishment of mutually beneficial economic relations with Beijing, Most parts of the Chinese market are still closed to European companies. \"\n\"The Tsarist Russian pandemic may ease doubts about China's presence in Europe. Although the major summit with European leaders in Beijing has been cancelled, China's cooperation in epidemic prevention and control can consolidate the positive image of the country. Brussels has received 2 million medical masks and 500000 virus tests from Beijing, \"a reminder to political scientists.\nBut distrust will not go away, Umarov believes. One example is Vucic's emotional speech at Alexandria. \" Experts concluded: perhaps not intentionally, Beijing is in conflict with European countries after all",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Madrid, 19 - Russian news agency, Elena czetnina. Compared with many other countries, Spain has a high mortality rate (according to the latest data) because it has one of the longest life expectancy countries in the world, Many of the patients - the elderly, in a conversation with a Russian News Agency reporter, doctor Andrei rubzov said he lives in Madrid and currently works in a nursing home.\nThis is a very complicated situation. In the elderly Center - in recent days, dozens of elderly people have died, only in the capital, Monte hermoso - about 20 people, in Erde de Tomelloso, The director of the centre, which is also ill at 12 leiar City, one of the Victorian centres in the Basque area), has killed eight people and the victims are in homes in other parts of Spain. Community authorities in Madrid have begun to inspect all homes for the elderly in the area, and the prosecutor's office has begun to investigate the situation.\nAt the amavir Pozuelo center, about 180 people work there. The first was found last week when a man was taken to hospital and the second confirmed Wednesday morning as a 90 year old woman. However, the infection rate is much higher, doctors are sure. There are also 10 patients with covid-19 symptoms. \" Some of them are in a difficult situationAbout But we can't confirm the diagnosis because there's no test. It's not easy to do a test, it's expensive, its quantity is limited, we ask the Ministry of health to give us a final diagnosis. But it's loaded now, \"Andre said.\nHe said many people in Spain are currently not diagnosed with coronavirus because they are unable to detect all people with mild symptoms. According to official figures on 19 March, more than 17000 cases have been confirmed. But the actual number is much higher. \" In order for a person to do a test, he must have a clear symptom: fever, respiratory failure, but not all patients, And only those with weaker immunity - these are the elderly, with hepatitis, tuberculosis, HIV. But if this is a young person with symptoms, they won't do the test, \"Andre explained.\nAt the home of the elderly, where he works, anyone who suspects coronavirus is in a separate room, and they don't go to public places, such as the canteen. Protective clothing for medical personnel - disposable work clothes, glasses, medical masks.\nRelatives are forbidden to visit patients. Others can only access the closest - 20 minutes a day and one.\nThere are four doctors in the nursing homAbout Andre is convinced that the spread of the Colorado virus will intensify, but he believes that the strength of the medical staff is enough.\nIn his view, Spain has a high mortality rate compared with other countries, which may be due to its long life expectancy - 83, Four is the highest in the world. But, Andre said, it's up to statistics. The Ministry of health did not provide complete data. Only 33% of people over 65 know it, 18% know it, over 75. Three other patients under the age of 65 died.\nAccording to the March 18 data, Italy has the highest mortality rate, 8%, Iran 6.5%, Spain 4.3%, China 4%, and other countries have lower mortality.\nRubuzov believes the situation in Spain could start to improve by the end of April. First, according to rubozov, \"it's about the periodicity of any epidemic situation, and there will be more sunny days.\"\nDoctors believe that the strict measures taken by the Spanish authorities have actually transferred the whole country to quarantine stations, which is the only thing that can be done. \" It's better than doing nothing, or allowing large-scale events, where pollution is bound to spread. \"\nHe believes that the media often make society hysterical. \" All this is driven by the media. People are crazy about iAbout An increase in the number of patients, such as any viral infection. But it's not a goblin or a plague. It's not even the ordinary flu, causing more deaths. Of course, people should know what happened. But, on the other hand, it's a precedent, and there seems to be no reason not to take similar measures during a normal flu pandemic, \"he said.\nIn general, health workers are much quieter about the virus than the average person - now in Spain, they are afraid to approach strangers. \" We're not crazy about personal self-defense. An average citizen thinks that if he shakes hands and says hello, two weeks later, he will lie down in the street with the Colorado virus, living and rotting, just like in the period of leprosy or plague. And keep a meter away - that's the advice for any respiratory infection - doctors warn.\nBy the way, in Spain, unlike in China, people try not only to wear masks, but also gloves. However, when trying to protect his Spaniard, Andre thinks it's ineffective. \" Everyone wore gloves, but they forgot to wear them. Let's imagine the situation: a person somehow touched the saliva of the patient, but did not take off his gloves, then touched his face with his hand, said hello, and pressed a button in the elevator. It's no use. Gloves only work. If you touch people who are infected, you throw them outAbout Masks, like gloves, are only needed when the patient is in contact. The usual medical mask doesn't work for more than an hour, it needs to be replaced. Many people just put it in their bags. They put it in every day. She looks like Andrea.\nWhy Italy, Spain and France are among the top three countries in Europe in terms of the transmission speed of Colorado virus can be explained as follows: When we meet in these countries, we usually kiss each other on the cheek. \" The Spanish are used to a very close contact. I think after that, they will behave carefully, not hug and kiss all people, \"the doctor suggested.\nSpaniards, who have been quarantined in their apartments for several days, open their windows or balconies at 8 p.m. every night, In order to support the doctors, they were applauded all over the country. \" nice to meet you. It's also a pleasure for the medical staff, and it's really enjoyable to see the community unite. \"\nAn update on covid-19 in Russia and around the world can be found on the stakoronavirus website",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Moscow, 19 Russian news agency. Doctors are increasingly pointing out that one of the most common symptoms of covid-19, combined with respiratory disease, is indigestion. The results of these two studies have been published in the American Journal of natural gas and the clinical gastroenterology and hepatology.\nThe first study was based on observations from three hospitals in Wuhan, China, which has become a center for disease transmission. From January 18 to February 28, scientists analyzed the symptoms of 204 patients with covid-19 and identified their symptoms. Nearly half of them complain mainly of indigestion: diarrhea or anorexia - complete loss of appetite. The most common symptoms are nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.\nStudies have shown that patients with digestive symptoms have a longer gap between the onset of initial symptoms and hospitalization than patients with documented symptoms. It's just respiratory symptoms. In addition, these people stay longer in the hospital for 9 days, rather than 7.3 days, and their treatment is more difficult.\nScientists believe that the first wave of the most serious patients developed respiratory symptoms. As a result, they are described as basic and disease resistantAbout\nHowever, the authors point out that they found eating disorders in seven patients with coronavirus infection, but did not show respiratory symptoms. According to doctors, these patients should be classified as early risk groups.\nIn the second article, scientists at the Yikang Medical College in Mount Sinai, New York, summed up key information from gastroenterologists, Coronavirus infection can be found in patients with chronic eating disorders.\n\"It's a rapidly growing area, with new information every day, -Quote Dr. Ryan Ungaro, MD, in a press release from the American Gastroenterology Association) Ryan Ungaro -Although covid-19 is a serious public health problem around the world, It is important to control risk in the long run and to understand ongoing research and recommendations in order to provide the most accurate advice to patients. \"\nAccording to scholars, special attention should be paid to patients with intestinal inflammation who receive immunosuppressantsAbout The article clearly points out that the American Gastroenterology Association believes that under no circumstances should these patients give up traditional drugs because of threats. Covid-19, because the risk of intestinal infection is much greater than that of coronavirus. These patients only need more strict quarantine and self isolation than others.\nThe researchers also reported that in the case of a previous coronary aneurysm with a severe acute respiratory infection, Diarrhea is one of the main symptoms in 25% of the infected people",

        "news_content_translate_en": "In the fight against coronaveros, the time for Disease Control in the United States has passed. The infection has penetrated our country and is now testing the health system in the United States. The authorities are openly optimistic, but privately, many experts doubt that the United States is ready for the challenge.\nAt the same time, America's claim to global leadership has also been tested. It is clear that the threat of this pandemic is that the selfishness of the state must be forgotten for the sake of the common good. Washington has called for at least no harm to Iran and North Korea if it does not help. It is not clear whether he will accept the appeal, but it is clear that they have made a sound of reason.\nSay hello with your elbow\nIn the United States, official data showed 712 cases and 27 deaths as of Tuesday. But on Wednesday, Atlantic magazine warned: \"official statistics are very low, everyone knows.\" According to the magazine, the problem lies in the evaluation method, first of all, the sample testers.\nAt present, it is believed that the infection known as covid-19 has spread to 35 of the 50 states in the United States and the Capital District of ColumbiaAbout This has raised serious concerns, particularly among US lawmakers, with a large proportion of older men. In addition, they often participate in community activities and shake hands with each other. Although in Washington, D.C., so-called social distance has become a pattern, including using elbows instead of contact.\nAt the end of February, many leading Republican politicians in the United States attended the traditional annual meeting of the conservative political action committee. Later, it was found that one of the guests at the event was infected with coronavirus. Moreover, according to the political daily, he is a very sociable person with access to almost all places, including the conference room, where participants wait for their turn to speak.\nSo now some of the other guests, including Senator Ted Cruz and at least five members of Congress, have announced that they will take preventive measures to segregate their families. These include the transition from Congress to White House chief of staff mark meadows and at least one lawmaker, Recent personal contacts with the chairman of the open ended Working GrouAbout\nSome members of Congress have passed the coronavirus screening just in case, although according to them, no one has any symptoms. It is understood that although both spoke to the Conservatives in the same forum, neither the tram party nor its vice president, Michael burns, was subject to such scrutiny. According to the White House, they did not talk to infected people there.\nNeurosis\nIn the past, trump has repeatedly called himself a Hermione terrorist, that is, a terrorist. A man in bacterial fear. But now he says he won't give up his usual handshake.\nCritics think he is confused. For example, the New York Times ran a large article to the effect that he didn't know how to deal with the virus of an invisible killer. The leadership comfort role has made it difficult for him to find a balance between confident confidence and naive hat, \"said the president's rival newspaper.\nBy the way, Washington Examiner, an online version of a cute white house boss, criticizes him for his lack of persuasive surface optimism. The title of the drafting commentary on this topic is \"in order to prevent the panic caused by coronavirus, it is possible for French marine reserves to intensify this panic\"About\nWe can recall that at the beginning, American leaders expressed their belief that with the warm weather, the spread of infection will inevitably disappear. He claimed that the threat of the epidemic was deliberately provoked by his political opponents. But when trump publicly called it the opposition's next scam, it met with such a strong and unanimous opposition that he no longer repeated that definition.\nOn the whole, the tension between American politicians is growing. Liz Chanet, the daughter of Congressman and former Vice President Richard Chanet, refused to attend the important retreat, Managed by the house of representatives to avoid particularly vulnerable \"family members\". One of her Democratic colleagues completely closed her capital office and went home to quarantine after she was found in a photo with the virus carrier on the c-pac forum.\nThe threat of this century?\nThe assessment of the US health authorities is inconsistent. They don't seem to have found a balance. On the one hand, of course, they can't underestimate the threat. On the other hand, they obviously want to emphasize that the devil is not as terrible as people portrayAbout\nAs a result, the main relevant national agency, the Centers for Disease Control（ \"The virus is likely to cause a pandemic.\" However, he noted, \"for most people, the direct risk of exposure to the virus is low.\". Jerome Adams, chief surgeon of the United States, stressed that for children and young people, covid-19 \"is not as lethal as flu.\".\nIn this case, U.S. health authorities continue to call on healthy people not to wear masks. Although the mention of the virus is in vain, it is not very logical. If so, why keep the mask for the medical staff and staff who care for the patient?  \nThe dual position of the authorities forces us to seek external assessments. Bill Gates, one of the richest people in the world, is a leading American philanthropist in the field of medicine The UK points out that the new corona rose has begun to behave quite similar to the once-in-a-century pathogens we are worried about. \"\n\"I hope it's not that bad, but before proving the opposite, we have to start from that, that is, we have to start from that.\" At worst, he stresseAbout Gates reported that his family philanthropy foundation is ready to spend $100 million to fight covid-19. He noted that a large part of these funds would be used to provide substantive assistance to poor countries. Because they are often the first pillar in identifying and responding to the threat of a common epidemic.\nKurt Campbell, former assistant secretary of state for Asian affairs, and Thomas Wright, a political scientist at the Brooklyn Institute in Washington, D.C., also believe that covid-19 could be a century old threat. \" \"One of the most serious peace crises in modern history.\" Together with the heinous terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001 and the financial collapse of 2008, they warned that the consequences of the crisis could be worse. \"\nAnother example is that they put the issue primarily in a political context and proved it to be a nationalistic border as a public management approach. \" Experience is important, institutions are important, the author wrote. This is a matter for the international community. An open answer, even if it's not welcome, makes sense. The system must be re run. \"\nI'm not the king. \"\nThe sharpness of this criticism is aimed at the springboard and its main slogan: \"make America great again\"About In general, in the context of the discussion of the impending dangers of the United States, a typical question is now being asked more and more often - who is the culprit?\nThe most common answer can also be considered classic: Of course, it's easiest to prove the bureaucracy of the past. \"\nLisa Monaco, a former adviser to former Democratic President Barack Obama on national security and counter-terrorism, proudly reports in a few days' Foreign Affairs magazine, In January 2017, he personally held a simulation exercise for the new springboard team to cope with a global pandemic caused by a new virus, U.S. Defense Forces (i.e. the U.S. defense forces, which replace their subordinates on the National Security Council). The significance of reminders is understandable: we all foresee in advance that the necessary plans and structures have been established, rather than our mistakes, if they are not used.\nIn general, springboard now has many people complaining that it has dismantled the anti epidemic device built under its predecessor, which not only includes the subordinate units of the National Security Bureau, But the Department of homeland security. As early as late January, the Journal of foreign policy wrote this article, accusing the current president of \"destroying his country and setting him as an example to Obama, \"Ronald Klein, former chief of staff of Vice President Joseph Biden.About\nAnother thing is that the back of the head is still robust, and the effect of past measures is questionable. Klein himself said at the Aspen Institute meeting in Washington in February that despite his resounding title, he had no real impact. My experience is \"King Ebola\"（ \"In the vast majority of cases, I'm not the king because we don't have a health command system in the United States,\" he said\nThere is no vertical. \"\nIn fact, experts generally agree that the health care structure in the United States has been and remains fragmented. There is no real \"vertical authority\" that can ensure a coordinated response across the country to the threat of the epidemic. Yes, what is the administrative vertical line: there is no right to sick leave in federal law, so there are some mistakes in Congress.\nIn general, system defects. The most obvious and poignant evidence is that 27.5 million Americans lack health insurance), which is 8.5% of the population. In the 2011 postmark, the index rose again. He has been declining for several years since he passed the Obama health plan act in 2010. About\nThe question is understandable: if uninsured people start to get sick, who will pay for their treatment? The hospital warned in advance that it would be devastating for them and could lead to bankruptcy. In 2007, the Journal of health finance published a study. According to this view, if there is another disaster like the 1918 influenza Spanish pandemic, US medical institutions will suffer 3.9 billion US dollars in losses. Hospitals with an average of $784592.\nBy the way, tramp recently said it was news that he might have died of flu. Although his grandfather died in 1918 in the same Spanish woman's father, Friedrich Trapp.\nEconomic background of elections\nThere is also a classic question, what should we do? \"They tried to drown the fire with money,\" the American replied in a familiar way The White House initially called for a $2.5 billion crackdown on covid-19, and lawmakers were afraid to allocate $8.3 billion. \" \"Well, I think that,\" said trump, who signed the bill last Friday with more than 100000 patients worldwide. Human beings.\nFor the White House and its owners, the economy is number oneAbout \"A key publication that the U.S. presidential information service has been focusing on in recent days is CNBC television, Moreover, under the threat of Colorado, \"employment growth in the country continues to exceed expectations,\" and the unemployment rate fell again to 3.5% in February. The emphasis on this theme is understandable: as far as the Preparatory Committee is concerned, it is directly related to the prospects for the re-election of the president in November.\nPlans developed within the framework of the fight against covid-19 fall within the same objective. Most importantly, the banking Union has urged the Federal Reserve System to continue to loosen monetary policy to stimulate the country's economic growth.\nAmong the government's stimulus measures, according to news reports, the president gave priority to tax cuts. In his view, these measures should include payroll taxes and come into force by the end of the year, at least before elections.\nHowever, these plans have not been completed. As we all know, American lawmakers have not supported this idea in the past. Now the opposition in Congress is pushing its agendAbout According to politico, \"Democrats are preparing legislation that will provide free Colorado virus testing and strengthen unemployment insurance, \"During the break, students who receive free food at school can continue to receive it and take paid sick leave.\"\nSwitch\nWhen it comes to covid-19, U.S. analysts and the press often try to move the perpetrators to China where the outbreak occurred. For example, a commentary in the Journal of national interests recently said: \"chaos created in China can be avoided.\" At the same time, there are also attempts to denigrate the World Health Organization, which is said to have facilitated Beijing and highly appreciates its efforts to fight AIDS.\nBut the response to such attacks is clear. Now, let's see whose system is better at responding to threats. China, who can buy it in Wuhan City, greatly exceeds the population of New York City - or the United States.\nAs long as the latter's action, at least, does not affect the imagination. Bloomberg introduced an incident at the University of California Medical Center, Transporting an infected patient there forced more than 120 staff members to quarantinAbout The National Union of nurses and nurses (the National Union of nurses and nurses) saw the incident as a systematic failure.\nJust today, Atlantis published an article saying, \"the failed Colorado virus test in the United States.\" According to its exclusive source, the magazine claims that so far, only 1895 people have been tested domestically. \" In the case of C [virus], H1N1 and Zika CDC performed well and distributed a large number of test packages to the whole country, -Thomas Frieden, former director of the Centers for disease control, told the magazine. \"I don't know what's wrong this time.\"\nDesperate\nGenerally speaking, experts and many observers understand that the US authorities should always reflect on themselves before trying to blame others. We'd better not put the blame on others, but try to cooperate internationally with all people without exception.\nThis is Bill Gates' call, this is his article in Campbell and Wright, Atlantis. \"Should help the enemy\" - experts stressed. -To this end, the United States and other countries can consider temporarily suspending certain sanctions against vulnerable countries such as Iran and North Korea, Control the virus if necessary. \"\nI asked my friends in the Ministry of foreign affairs if they had done any concrete work in this regard. The answer I heard was, \"not yet.",

There is no mention of what strategies would be implemented for compliance, nor for cases of refusal. The documents do not cite the possibility of creating “concentration camps”.\nIn recent years, Australia's national government has boosted vaccination rates by conditioning certain welfare benefits on compliance with immunization requirements, see here The states of Victoria and New South Wales have also enacted legislation that would prohibit parents who refuse to vaccinate their children from enrolling them in childcare or primary school (here ; here).\nAustralia’s Department of Social Services here indicates that there are still a number of reasons for a child to be exempted from vaccination, including medical contraindications or natural immunity. There is no “forced” or otherwise compulsory vaccination program in Australia, aside from the financial incentives and penalty schedule implemented by the national and some state governments.\nThe claim's inspiration about \"refusers\" being sent to \"concentration camps\" is likely a reference to the controversial use of Christmas Island—a former detention center for those seeking asylum in Australia—as a quarantine site for China evacuees under surveillance for symptoms of COVID-19, here The New York Times described the experiences of these coronavirus evacuees in detail here Many who spent time there reported poor living conditions in the facilities on the island, citing hygiene issues (here).\nAs of March 3, 2020, Australia reports 33 confirmed cases of COVID-19 (here).\nFalse: Australia’s coronavirus pandemic plan will not “force” mass vaccinate population and send those who refuse to “concentration camps”.\n",

It’s urgent for all countries to strengthen international coordination in macro policies such as public health policy, trade policy, fiscal and monetary policy,” Chen said.\n“We will actively participate in international cooperation in response to challenges posed by the complex situation.”\nChen said that while downward pressure on the global economy is increasing as the virus rattles financial markets, he said he expects significant improvement in the Chinese economy in the second quarter.\nPrivate-sector analysts are slashing their growth forecasts for China to lows not seen since the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, with a sharp contraction expected in the first quarter.\n“At present, the operation of China’s financial market is generally stable, market expectations are relatively stable, and the space for macro policies and tool reserves are sufficient,” Chen said.\nThe PBOC will keep liquidity reasonably ample, keep growth of M2 money supply and total social financing in line with nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth and aim for slightly higher credit rise, Chen added.\nThe PBOC has already rolled out a raft of measures, including cutting lending rates and banks’ reserve ratios, and doling out cheap loans for selected firms, to cushion the blow to the economy from the coronavirus outbreak.\nChina, where the virus outbreak originated late last year in the central city of Wuhan, is widely expected to see its economy contract in the first quarter due to efforts to contain the spread of the disease.\nWhile the coronavirus is expected to continue exerting upward pressure on China’s consumer prices in the near term, inflation could ease in the coming quarters, he said.\nChen also said he expects China’s yuan currency to remain stable around 7.0 to the U.S. dollar in the near term, due in part to ample foreign exchange reserves.\nThe country’s debt market is stable, with no significant rise in defaults, he said during a briefing where he was joined by other senior Chinese financial regulators.\nZhou Liang, vice chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said China is ready to buffer financial risks caused by the virus outbreak, and is studying plans to reform the country’s asset management companies that are tasked to deal with bad loans.\nChina’s non-performing loan ratio rose to 2.08% at the end of February, Zhou said, adding that China’s banking sector has disposed of a total of 5.8 trillion yuan ($817.48 billion) in bad loans in the past three years.\n",

(We) hope the outside world does not involve us in politics and saves us a space for research,” Ming Pao, quoted the microbiologists as saying in a retraction notice.\nIn an interview with Chinese-language media Zhi News, also on Wednesday, Yuen said: “Maybe no one loves the country more than I do.”\nYuen is a member of a team advising Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on the coronavirus epidemic. The co-author of the article was David Christopher Lung, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong.\nYuen did not respond to an email request for comment. Reuters could not reach Lung for comment.\nIn the column published on Wednesday, the experts urged the Chinese and Hong Kong governments to learn from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 and close all wildlife markets, as well as improve hygiene in wet markets.\nThey urged people to analyze information rationally and stop spreading rumors that the virus originated in the United States.\nChina has suggested the U.S. military might have brought the virus to the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak is believed to have originated. A U.S. State Department official responded saying China seeking to deflect criticism of its role in “starting a global pandemic”.\n“Excessively killing and eating wildlife, treating animals inhumanely, disrespecting lives ... the ugly habits of Chinese people are the root of origin of the virus. With these attitudes, after another decade, SARS 3.0 will surely reappear,” they wrote.\nChina’s legislature said last month it would immediately ban the trade and consumption of wild animals for food, after some of the earliest infections were found in people who had exposure to a wildlife market in Wuhan, where bats, snakes, civets and other animals were sold illegally.\nThe coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people in China, killing 3,245 as of Wednesday. Hong Kong has 192 confirmed cases.\nGlobally, more than 204,000 people have been infected and more than 8,700 have died.\n",

Later, hospitals in Wuhan witnessed an \"exponential\" increase in the number of cases in late December that cannot be linked back to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.\nWhistleblower doctor Li Wenliang warned a group of other doctors about a possible outbreak of an illness that resembled \"severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\". He urged them to take protective measures against infection.\nOn December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission declared that their investigation has not found \"any obvious human-to-human transmission and no medical staff infection.\"\nChina contacted the World Health Organization (WHO) three weeks after doctors first started noticing the cases.\nAt the beginning of January 2020, summons were issued to Li Wenliang by the Wuhan Public Security Bureau accusing the doctor of \"spreading rumours.\"\nOn January 3, Dr Li signed a statement at a police station acknowledging his \"misdemeanour\" and promising not to commit further \"unlawful acts.\" China's National Health Commission ordered institutions not to publish any information related to the unknown disease.\nOn the same day, the Hubei Provincial Health Commission ordered to stop testing samples from Wuhan related to the new disease and destroyed all existing samples.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission released another statement, reiterating that preliminary investigations have shown \"no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission and no medical staff infections.\"\nFifty-nine people in Wuhan were sickened by a \"pneumonia-like illness\", as per a report by The New York Times published on January 6. On the same day, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued a level 1 travel watch. It advised travellers to Wuhan to avoid contact with 'living or dead animals, animal markets, and sick people.'\nOn January 8, Chinese medical authorities claimed to have identified the virus, reiterating that it still found \"no clear evidence of human-to-human transfer\".\nOn January 11, China announced its first death from the virus, a 61-year-old man who had purchased goods from the seafood market.\nOn the same day, the Wuhan City Health Commission released a Q&A sheet emphasising that most of the unexplained viral pneumonia cases in Wuhan have a history of exposure to the South China seafood market and \"no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission has been found.\"\nDr Li Wenliang was hospitalised on January 12. He started coughing and developed a fever after unknowingly treating a patient with the coronavirus. Later, Wenliang's condition deteriorated so badly that he was admitted to the intensive care unit and was given oxygen support.\nOn January 13, the first case of novel coronavirus was reported outside China involving a 61-year-old Chinese woman in Thailand, who had visited Wuhan.\nHowever, Thailand's ministry of public health said the woman had not visited the Wuhan seafood market and had come down with a fever on January 5. The woman had visited a different, smaller market in Wuhan, in which live and freshly slaughtered animals were sold.\nOn January 14, the World Health Organization in its report stated: ‘Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China.’\nOn January 15, Japan reported its first case of coronavirus and its health ministry said the patient had not visited any seafood markets in China.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission in a statement said that the possibility of \"limited human-to-human transmission\" cannot be ruled out.\nDespite the fact that Wuhan doctors knew that the virus was \"contagious\", city authorities allowed 40,000 families to gather and share home-cooked food in a Lunar New Year banquet, as per the article in National Review.\nOn January 19, the Chinese National Health Commission declared the virus \"still preventable and controllable\".\nA day later, the head of China's national health commission team investigating the outbreak, confirmed that two cases of infection in China's Guangdong province had been caused by \"human-to-human transmission and medical staff had been infected\".\nOn January 21, the CDC announced the first case of the coronavirus in the US. The patient had returned from China six days ago.\nOn January 22, a WHO delegation conducted a field visit to Wuhan and concluded, \"deployment of the new test kit nationally suggests that human-to-human transmission is taking place in Wuhan.\"\nNearly two months after the first case of the virus was reported, Chinese authorities announced their 'first steps for a quarantine of Wuhan.' By this time, a significant number of Chinese citizens had travelled abroad as \"asymptomatic, oblivious carriers\".\nDr Wenliang tested positive for coronavirus on February 1 and died six days later.\nToday, the killer bug has spread to over 170 countries across the globe, apart from Antarctica. After inflicting its wrath in Asia, the virus has now travelled to Europe which has become the new epicentre of the disease outbreak.\nCases in Europe topped 250,000 -- more than half of which were in Spain and hard-hit Italy. Spain recorded 655 new fatalities over 24 hours, while Italy's death toll rose by 712 to hit 8,215.\n",

In some places soldiers are patrolling the streets to keep consumers and workers indoors, halting services and production and breaking supply chains.\n\"The global health crisis is rapidly morphing into a global recession, as there is a clear tension between preventing infections and ruining the economy,\" said Edoardo Campanella, an economist at UniCredit Bank in Milan.\nBut Wall Street bounced from three-year lows as investors pin their hopes on the US Senate passing a $2 trillion stimulus bill.\nConfirmed coronavirus cases around the world exceeded 377,000 across 194 countries and territories as of early Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, more than 16,500 of them fatal.\nIn Geneva, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said infections in the United States had greatly increased.\nOver the previous 24 hours, 85 per cent of new cases were in Europe and the United States, and of those, 40 per cent were in the United States.\nAs of Monday, the virus had infected more than 42,000 people there, killing at least 559.\nAsked whether the United States could become the new epicenter, Harris said: \"We are now seeing a very large acceleration in cases in the US. So it does have that potential.\"\nSome US state and local officials have decried a lack of coordinated federal action, saying that having localities act on their own has put them in competition for supplies.\nPresident Donald Trump acknowledged the difficulty.\n\"The World market for face masks and ventilators is Crazy. We are helping the states to get equipment, but it is not easy,\" he tweeted.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday the government would impose a nationwide lockdown from midnight for 21 days.\nHealth researchers have warned that more than a million people in India could be infected with the coronavirus by mid-May, prompting the government to shut down all air and train travel, businesses and schools.\nOn Tuesday, Modi, leader of the world’s biggest democracy, went further, saying nobody would be allowed to leave their homes.\n\"The only way to save ourselves from coronavirus is if we don’t leave our homes, whatever happens, we stay at home,\" Modi said.\nIndia has so far reported 482 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and nine deaths.\nOLYMPIC ORGANIZERS GIVE IN\nOlympic Games organizers and the Japanese government had clung to the hope that the world’s biggest sporting event could go ahead, but finally bowed to the inevitable to make Tokyo 2020 the latest and biggest victim of a ravaged sporting calendar.\nAfter a call with International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach, Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the July 24-Aug. 9 event would be rescheduled for the summer of 2021 at the latest - as proof of victory over the coronavirus.\n\"President Bach said he is in agreement, 100 per cent.\"\nIt was the first time in the Olympics’ 124-year history that they had been postponed, though they were canceled outright three times during the two 20th-century world wars.\nOf the top 10 countries by case numbers, Italy has reported the highest fatality rate, at around 10%, which at least partly reflects its older population. The fatality rate globally - the ratio of deaths to confirmed infections - is around 4.3%, though national figures can vary widely according to how much testing is done.\nBritain, believed by experts to be about two weeks behind Italy in the outbreak cycle, on Tuesday began curbs on movement without precedent in peacetime after Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered the country to stay at home.\nThe streets of the capital were quiet as all but essential shops closed and people only went to work if it was unavoidable.\nJohnson had resisted pressure to impose a full lockdown even as other European countries had done so, but was forced to change tack as projections showed the health system could become overwhelmed.\nMeanwhile, China’s Hubei province, the original center of the outbreak, will lift curbs on people leaving the area, but other regions will tighten controls as new cases double due to imported infections.\nThe provincial capital Wuhan, which has been in total lockdown since January 23, will lift its travel restrictions on April 8.\nHowever, the risk from overseas infections appears to be on the rise, prompting tougher screening and quarantine measures in cities such as the capital Beijing.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Over 6,000 people have died globally since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. More than 1,62,000 have been infected by Covid-19. What started in China, soon spread across France, the US, Spain, Italy, South Korea and now India.\nIndia, so far, has officially reported 110 cases and two deaths, according to the Ministry of Health. More cases are emerging every day even as states continue to issue advisories on social distancing.\nThe government has put in place stringent measures to curb the spread of the virus. A mandatory quarantine of 14 days has been initiated for all international travellers arriving in the country.\nFrom thermal screenings at major entry-exit points to sanitisation of public places, the Indian government has put its best foot forward in battling the pandemic which has led to significant panic among Indians.\nSelf-discipline is the best cure\nHowever, more than scrutinising the steps taken by the government, the utmost requirement at the moment is self-discipline.\nWith the threat of the rapidly spreading virus looming large over India due to its billion-plus population, it is important to understand the depravity that could be if the spread is not limited in the initial days.\nItaly is the best example to map how rapidly the virus can spread and why it is absolutely essential to impose self-restrictions at an early stage, and not wait for the disaster to strike.\nThe country recorded 368 more deaths from the coronavirus outbreak on Sunday, its biggest single-day rise, amid growing concern about the ability of its strained health system to cope with the relentless increase in new cases. With 24,747 cases and 1,809 deaths by Sunday - a rise of 368 or 25 per cent in the death toll in just 24 hours - Italy's experience has offered an alarming example for other European countries. And, Indians should take note.\nThe daily rise in cases around the globe, especially in countries like Italy -- with a small population of 60 million people -- is alarming. If the virus spreads with such aggressiveness in India, it could result in severe consequences even after the virus fades away.\nIn Italy, hospitals are also unable to cope with such high-frequency rise on a daily basis. Roberta Re, a nurse at Piacenza hospital in Emilia-Romagna called the situation 'war-like', as reported by The Guardian.\n\"It's an experience I would compare to a world war, but it's a war that isn't fightable with traditional arms - as we don't yet know who the enemy is and so it's difficult to fight. The only weapon we do have to avoid things getting even worse is to stay at home and to respect the rules, to do what they did in China, as this is paying off,\" she said.\nPrecaution, not panic\nWith an abundance of global examples that show the severe spread of Covid-19, it can be deduced that most infections spread through lack of individual restrictions at an initial stage. And as the situation aggravated with rising cases in a country or one particular area, the excessive panic was witnessed.\nThis panic, if substituted by precautions at early stages, could help India avoid the health crisis of a much larger magnitude. However, the government alone would not be able to help limit the virus; all citizens must also act responsibly and take the outbreak seriously.\nSocial media chatter over the past few months since the outbreak has often misled people, as some took it lightly and others panicked to insanity. However, doctors advised none of the above. Instead, they asked people to be prepared with some basic but necessary precautions. Social distancing, however, is the most important one.\nThree ways that you can help\n1) Doctors have asked people to stay home if they absolutely do not have to go out.\n2) Medical experts have also asked people to avoid any kind of large gatherings.\n3) Take care of hygiene, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your face\nThese are a few simple steps you can take to support the government in limiting the spread of Covid-19. While not much is known about this virus, doctors, have asked people to follow these important steps at the moment to delay the spread of the virus. But even if you test positive, there is no need to suppress your travel history or run away.\nThe quarantine process is not only for the recovery of an infected person but it is also for the safety of other people in the country. Going by the rate of spread in Italy, Iran, and China, any person with symptoms coming in contact with other people could prove deadly as the virus would keep multiplying. Even if it does not affect an individual carrying it, doctors have clearly mentioned that its spread could be fatal for older people with a weak immune system.\nFor instance, one of the first cases in Uttar Pradesh's Noida which led to an initial shut down of two schools and a five-star hotel, was from a man who returned from Italy and kept his travel history suppressed. He then kept on with his usual social life, exposing others to the danger.\nThere are many other reports in India about suspected people running away in fear that they would be kept in isolation in the quarantine facility. But people have to realise that the process will help in containing the spread of the virus to a great extent.\nIndia is still in the initial stages with 110 official confirmed cases, and so far, it has managed to keep the death toll much lower than the other countries in the third week of the outbreak. And, by imposing self-restrictions, individuals can help the government in flattening the curve further.\nPeople on social media, especially, the young batch who are yet to grasp the seriousness of the issue, need to be more self vigilant. The basics include - doctor visit for 'flu-like symptoms', avoiding crowded places and social gathering until absolutely necessary, restricting movement, opting for work-from-home. It is important to realise that every country initially had a mere number of cases, but within days it rose massively.\nDesperate times call for desperate measures, and at this hour, more than scrutinising the steps taken by the government, it is imperative to focus on personal hygiene and self-discipline.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "自从新型冠状病毒爆发以来，全球已有6000多人死亡。超过162000人感染了Covid-19。从中国开始，很快就传遍了法国、美国、西班牙、意大利、韩国和现在的印度。\n印度卫生部称，到目前为止，印度已经正式报告了110例病例和2例死亡病例。尽管各国继续就社会距离问题发表咨询意见，但每天仍有更多的案件出现。\n政府已采取严厉措施来遏制病毒的传播。对所有抵达该国的国际旅客实行14天的强制性检疫。\n从主要出入境点的热网检查到公共场所的卫生处理，印度政府在抗击这场导致印度民众严重恐慌的流行病方面已经迈出了最好的一步。\n自律是最好的治疗方法\n然而，除了仔细审查政府采取的措施外，目前的最大要求是自律。\n由于印度人口超过10亿，病毒迅速传播的威胁在印度上空隐约可见，因此，了解如果在最初几天不限制病毒传播的话，可能造成的堕落是很重要的。\n意大利是最好的例子，可以说明病毒的传播速度，以及为什么在早期实施自我限制是绝对必要的，而不是等待灾难降临。\n周日，美国因冠状病毒爆发而死亡的人数增加了368人，创下单日最大增幅，人们越来越担心其紧张的卫生系统是否有能力应对不断增加的新病例。截至周日，意大利共有24747例病例和1809人死亡，仅24小时内死亡人数就上升368人或25%，意大利的经验为其他欧洲国家提供了一个令人震惊的例子。而且，印度人应该注.\n全球范围内，尤其是意大利这样的人口只有6000万的国家，病例每天都在增加，这令人震惊。如果病毒以这种侵略性在印度传播，即使在病毒消退后，也可能造成严重后果。\n在意大利，医院也无法应付每天如此高频率的上涨。据《卫报》报道，埃米利娅·罗曼尼亚皮亚琴扎医院的护士罗伯塔·雷称，这种情况“像战争一样”。\n“与世界大战相比，这是一次经历，但这是一场用传统武器无法战斗的战争——因为我们还不知道敌人是谁，所以很难战斗。我们要避免事情变得更糟，唯一的武器就是呆在家里，尊重规则，做他们在中国做的事，因为这是值得的，”她说。\n小心，不要惊慌\n有大量的全球例子表明Covid-19的严重传播，可以推断大多数感染在最初阶段是通过缺乏个人限制传播的。随着一个国家或一个特定地区的案件不断增加，局势进一步恶化，出现了过度的恐慌。\n这种恐慌如果在早期阶段被预防措施所取代，将有助于印度避免更大程度的健康危机。然而，仅靠政府是无法帮助控制病毒的；所有公民也必须负责任地采取行动，认真对待疫情。\n自疫情爆发以来的过去几个月里，社交媒体的喋喋不休常常误导人们，因为有些人对此不以为然，另一些人则惊慌失措，精神错乱。然而，医生并没有给出上述建议。相反，他们要求人们准备一些基本但必要的预防措施。然而，社会距离是最重要的。\n你能帮助的三种方法\n1） 医生们要求人们如果绝对不必外出，就呆在家里。\n2） 医学专家还要求人们避免任何形式的大型集.\n3） 注意卫生，洗手至少20秒，避免触摸面部\n以下是一些简单的步骤，你可以采取支持政府限制Covid-19的传播。虽然对这种病毒的了解不多，但医生们已经要求人们在目前遵循这些重要步骤来延缓病毒的传播。但即使你测试呈阳性，也没有必要隐瞒你的旅行记录或逃跑。\n检疫程序不仅是为了恢复受感染者的健康，而且也是为了国内其他人的安全。以意大利、伊朗和中国的传播速度计算，任何有症状的人与他人接触都可能致命，因为病毒会不断繁殖。即使它不会影响携带它的人，医生也明确提到，它的传播对于免疫系统较弱的老年人来说可能是致命的。\n例如，北方邦诺伊达的第一批案件中，有一个是一个从意大利回来的人，他隐瞒了自己的旅行历史，导致两所学校和一家五星级酒店初步关闭。然后，他继续他平常的社交生活，使其他人面临危险。\n印度还有许多其他的报道说，怀疑有人因为害怕被隔离在隔离设施中而逃跑。但人们必须意识到，这一过程将在很大程度上有助于遏制病毒的传播。\n印度仍处于初步阶段，有110例官方确诊病例，到目前为止，在疫情爆发的第三周，印度设法将死亡人数远远低于其他国家。而且，通过实施自我约束，个人可以帮助政府进一步平抑曲线。\n社交媒体上的人们，特别是那些还没有意识到问题严重性的年轻人，需要提高警. 最基本的措施包括：看医生以防出现“流感样症状”，在绝对必要时避免拥挤的地方和社交聚会，限制行动，选择在家工作。重要的是要认识到，每个国家一开始都只有几个病例，但几天之内就大量上升。\n不顾一切的时候需要采取不顾一切的措施，在这个时候，除了仔细审查政府采取的措施外，还必须注重个人卫生和自律",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The battle to contain the coronavirus reached new urgency, as more governments locked down borders and ordered new closures and restrictions and pleas went out to funnel masks and ventilators to places struggling with soaring numbers of sick patients.\nThe growing sense of crisis rocked financial markets Monday, particularly on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 12.9%. Investors' fears that the pandemic will throw the economy into a recession sent the market to its worst one-day loss since 1987.\nThe shift in the battle lines was made clear by tallies showing cases outside China have surpassed those inside it and Spain now has the fourth-most cases in the world. The central Chinese city that was the former epicenter where the viral illness was first detected in December was down to just one new case on Tuesday.\nWith the number of cases worldwide topping 181,000, a surge of patients in Madrid's hospitals fueled worries across Europe of what lies ahead.\n\"There is no easy or quick way out of this extremely difficult situation,\" said Mark Rutte, the prime minister of the Netherlands, in the first televised speech by a Dutch premier since 1973.\nOnly China, Italy and Iran have more infections than Spain, where the number increased by roughly 20%, to 9,191 and fatalities rose to 309, according to the Spanish Health Ministry. It switched to a new reporting system, so the actual number may be higher.\nA somber Rutte told viewers \"a large part\" of the Netherlands' 17 million people are likely to contract the virus. So far, 1,413 people have tested positive and 24 have died. The government closed schools, restaurants and bars and banned gatherings of more than 100 people.\nCountries from Canada to Switzerland, Russia and Malaysia announced sharp new restrictions on the movement of people across their borders.\n\"We have a window of time at the moment to slow the spread of the virus,\" said Ulrike Demmer, a spokeswoman for Germany's government, which reversed its earlier insistence that border controls would not work. It imposed new limits on crossings with France, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark and Luxembourg, after German infections increased by more than 1,000 over 24 hours.\nWith much-needed ventilators in short supply, the British government asked manufacturers, including automakers Ford and Rolls-Royce, to convert some of their assembly lines to making the life-saving equipment.\n\"We are facing what is an unprecedented situation and that is going to require an unprecedented response,\" said James Slack, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\nAround the world, fast-changing rules and restrictions tore up the script for daily life. Bars, pubs and restaurants were closed or restricting orders to takeout and delivery. Cemeteries in the Croatian capital restricted attendance at funerals to the closest relatives. U.S. casinos went dark, not just in Las Vegas, but in more than a dozen states.\nMalaysia banned travel in and out of the country for two weeks and is allowing only essential services to stay open. France allowed people to leave home only to buy food, go to work, or do other essential tasks, restrictions President Emmanuel Macron said were heightened because people hadn't complied with earlier guidelines and \"we are at war.\"\nThe first confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Somalia, which has one of Africa's weakest health systems after nearly three decades of conflict between the government and the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group.\nCHINA, S KOREA TRY TO HOLD GAINS\nAs the pandemic expanded its reach, China and South Korea were trying to hold their hard-fought gains. China is quarantining new arrivals, who in recent days have accounted for an increasing number of cases, and South Korea starting Thursday will increase screenings of all travelers arriving from overseas.\nChina on Tuesday reported 21 new cases of the virus, 20 of them imported. Just one new case was confirmed in Wuhan, the Hubei provincial capital where the illness was first detected in late December. The update raised China's totals to 80,881 cases and 3,226 deaths.\nChina this week relaxed travel restrictions in Hubei, sending thousands of workers back to long-shuttered factories.\nMost of the world's 78,000 recovered patients are in China. The virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, for most people, but severe illness is more likely in the elderly and people with existing health problems.\nIn the United States, officials urged older Americans and those with chronic health conditions to stay home, and recommended all group gatherings be capped at 50 people.\nAmericans returning from abroad encountered chaotic airport health screenings that clearly broke all virus-fighting rules against having packed crowds close together.\nSchool closings in 56 countries kept more than 516 million students home, the United Nations said. New York City joined those ranks Monday, closing a school system with 1.1 million students.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen suggested a 30-day ban on people entering the bloc for non-essential travel reasons.\n\"The less travel, the more we can contain the virus,\" she said in a video message.\nA number of EU member countries have, so far, resisting such far-reaching controls. But many went ahead with measures to sharply curtail activities inside their borders.\nSwitzerland's government declared a state of emergency, ordering shops, restaurants, bars and other facilities shut down. The measures exclude health-care operations as well as supermarkets, but also include entertainment and leisure facilities, which will be closed until April 19.\n\"We need to do everything possible to slow the advance of the coronavirus,\" Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga said, urging people to practice social distancing and follow government guidelines.\nStill, some countries have resisted more stringent measures to contain the virus.\nIn Britain, bars and restaurants remained open and there was no ban on large events. The prime minister's spokesman said closing schools hadn't been ruled out, but \"the scientific and medical advice is that that's not a step which we should be taking at this point in time.\"\nItaly reported another jump in infections Monday, up more than 3,000 to 27,980. With 2,158 deaths - including 349 more in just the last 24 hours - Italy now accounts for well over a quarter of the global death toll. Cases, however, slowed in Lombardy, the hardest-hit region.\nIn Spain, a cut in the frequency of commuter trains created considerable crowds during rush hour.\nWearing blue latex gloves, cleaner Mari Carmen Ramírez said she, like many others, couldn't afford to risk her salary of 950 euros ($1,042) per month.\n\"I fear the coronavirus, but I fear more not being able to pay the utility bills,\" the 55-year-old said. \"When this is all over, how are we going to eat?\"\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The coronavirus outbreak that started in China's Wuhan city in early December last year has now spread to at least 105 countries/territories. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), as on March 9, there were 109,577 confirmed cases of COVID-19 (the disease caused by this new variant of coronavirus) were reported world over. The global death toll due to COVID-19 stands at 3,809 with most of them (3,123) being reported in China. Despite concerted efforts of the international community, the total number of cases and deaths continues to rise every day.\nWhile China is the epicentre for coronavirus outbreak, the past few weeks have seen a spike in the number of cases and deaths in other countries. South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran are among the worst-hit countries apart from China.\nIn India, 39 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported so far. These have been reported from Kerala, Telangana, Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, Ladakh and Uttar Pradesh. Besides them, thousands of people who are suspected to have come in contact with the confirmed cases have been put in quarantines for observation.\n1) Mapping coronavirus outbreak\nSeveral countries have imposed travel and trade restrictions to and from China as the viral infection continues to spread. Every day hundreds of new cases are being reported from China and elsewhere, triggering a global health scare.\nTo help explain the nature and scale of the coronavirus outbreak, IndiaToday.in is regularly analysing key data and trends related to this epidemic and brings you this in-depth data-driven analysis on coronavirus outbreak.\n(These charts and figures will be regularly updated to provide you the latest information.)\n(The interactive dashbaord presented above has been prepared by the World Health Organisation and monitors coronavirus (COVID-19) cases on a daily basis. You can explore the dashboard using the tabs on the bottom i.e. map, cases by date of report, and cumulative cases)\n2) Overall numbers: COVID-19 cases and deaths\nThe two graphs below show the rate at which COVID-19 cases have risen world over and the number of lives that the coronavirus outbreak has claimed.\n3) Wuhan: Where it all started\nInvestigations into the coronavirus outbreak so far have revealed that the infection started from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan in China's Hubei Province.\nChina officially informed the World Health Organisation about these strange pneumonia-like symptoms emanating from \"unknown causes\" on December 31. Since then, the WHO has been regularly monitoring the situation and issuing guidelines and precautions.\nThe Hubei Province has been the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, accounting for 83 per cent of all cases and 96 per cent of all coronavirus-related deaths in China so far.\nThe map below shows the extent of coronavirus outbreak in China.\nIt is clear that while Hubei Province remains the epicenter of coronavirus outbreak and that COVID-19 cases have been reported from all provinces in China, but all parts of the country are not evenly affected.\nBesides Hubei Province, the other regions that have reported high number of cases are: Gangdong, Henan, Zhejiang and Hunan provinces. The remaining provinces had reported less than 1,000 cases as on March 8. The Xizang province (commonly known as Tibet) is the least affected with just one case reported so far.\nExperts have opinined that yearly migration in China on account of the Lunar New Year festivities could have contributed significantly to the spread of the viral infection across China. The country's Transport Ministry had estimated that nearly 3 billion trips will be made during the festivities, which trigger the world's biggest annual human migration every year.\n4) Coronavirus cases outside China\nThe viral COVID-19 infection that started at a seafood market in Wuhan, has now infected people in at least 101 countries/territories. In the early phase of the outbreak, it was believed that the viral infection cannot transmit between humans.\nHowever, as cases mounted in China and many cases started being reported in other countries, health experts found evidence of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus.\nThe first batch of confirmed coronavirus cases outside China was reported in mid-Janaury: two cases in Thailand and one each in Japan and South Korea.\nFollowing this, several countries started screening passengers arriving from China at their airports.\nTo explain the geographical spread of coronavirus outbreak, here is a GIF that captures how COVID-19 infection started in China and spread to other parts of the world within few weeks.\nGeographical spread of coronavirus\nThe chart below organises size of countries based on the number of confirmed cases reported in each of them.\n5) Daily trends: New cases & deaths\nThe trend of daily increase/decrese in new cases and deaths is an important indicator that is useful in understanding an outbreak. It helps in figuring out the scale at which new cases/deaths are being reported globally.\nThe following chart shows that number of daily new cases kept on increasing till February 5 (the day when 3,925 new cases were reported) and saw a slow decrease thereafter, indicating that fewer new cases were being reported.\nHowever, on February 13, China changed its methodology of reporting confirmed COVID-19 cases by introducing clinical diagnosis as a method to confirm cases, in addition to laboratory tests. The clinical diagnosis was limited to Hubei Province (where the epicentre of this outbreak--Wuhan--is located), but this methology saw an overnight exponential rise in the daily number of new cases.\nWHO data show that on February 13, China reported 15,158 new coronavirus cases (the highest in a single day). Though the number fell in the following days but since February 21, there has been a rising trend in the number of new cases being reported daily. Our analysis shows that most of these new cases were reported outside China. (We will discuss this aspect in details in the subsequent sections of this article).\n6) People are being cured too\nThe above two daily charts show new COVID-19 cases are being reported from China and other countries every day. But there is another daily trend that seems to indicate a positive development.\nData analysed from the daily status reports of China's National Health Commission show that the number of people who are being released from various hospitals in the country after getting cured in on the rise. Between February 2 and 18, a total of 14,314 coronavirus patients were discharged from hospitals in China. Health authorities will however continue to monitor them for some days.\n7) Appeals for funds\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has appealed to the international community to come forward and contribute funds to combat the coronavirus outbreak. The WHO has set the target of raising $61.5 million to fight this epidemic.\nAs on February 17, the WHO had received only $1 million in form of donations for this cause. However, various countries and international organisations have pledged to contribute and pledged amount so far is $24.4 million. Put together, the amount received and pledged comprise 41.3 per cent of WHO's target.\n",

This article, entitled \"providing strong technological support for the prevention and control of the epidemic situation,\" was published today (15) on the website of Qiushi. It was a speech by Xi Jinping in March 2nd with the heads of relevant departments and experts and scholars on the epidemic prevention and control research.\nAccording to the article published in the online magazine, Xi Jinping said that the scientific and technological front should be regarded as a major urgent task for epidemic prevention and control, including strengthening the research and development of drugs, medical equipment and clinical treatment, improving the cure rate and reducing the mortality rate; accelerating the convergence of vaccine research and industrialization chain, and coordinating the research of virus traceability and transmission routes, and using artificial intelligence, big data and other new technologies. Carry out epidemiological and traceability investigation.\nAccording to Xi Jinping's article entitled \"providing strong scientific and technological support for the prevention and control of the epidemic situation,\" the research conducted by the Academy of Military Medical Sciences and Tsinghua University medical school is mainly focused on investigating the progress of epidemic prevention and control, and visiting the research and research workers who are fighting the epidemic prevention and control. The novel coronavirus pneumonia is the most serious public health emergency in China since its establishment. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to and makes rapid deployment, takes the prevention and control of epidemic situation as a top priority, puts the people's life safety and health first, puts forward the general requirements of firm confidence, working together in the same boat, scientific prevention and control, and precise implementation of policies, and defines the general goal of Resolutely Curbing the spread of epidemic situation and winning the prevention and control of epidemic situation. Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee and through hard work in all aspects, the current situation of epidemic prevention and control is expanding.\nNovel coronavirus pneumonia was held by the Central Committee of the CPC Central Committee recently. The meeting was held in the Central Committee of the CPC Central Committee to promote the prevention and control of new crown pneumonia and economic and social development. Xi Jinping made the speech. The novel coronavirus pneumonia Committee was also chaired by the Standing Committee meeting of the Central Political Bureau and the Political Bureau meeting of the Central Committee of the CPC。 On these occasions, I stressed that the victory of the epidemic can not be achieved without the support of science and technology. We should speed up research and development by integrating multi-disciplinary forces. We should speed up the progress of research and development on the basis of adhering to the scientific nature and ensuring safety, strive to make breakthroughs as soon as possible, and come up with practical and effective research results as soon as possible.\nXi Jinping said that since the outbreak of the epidemic, the national science and technology front has responded positively to the call of the Central Committee of the party, and has established 12 scientific research departments, including science and technology, health and other departments, to identify five main directions, namely, clinical treatment and drug development, vaccine detection and technology, products, viral etiology and epidemiology, animal model construction, and organize interdisciplinary and cross disciplinary research teams, scientific research and clinical practice. . the front line of prevention and control is coordinated with each other, and all parties of production, education and research work closely together. In just over one month, positive progress has been made. In less than a week, we determined the whole genome sequence of the new coronavirus, isolated the virus strain and shared it with the world in a timely manner; to meet the urgent needs of epidemic prevention and control, we opened the list nationwide and launched a variety of detection reagent products in stages; we quickly screened a batch of effective drugs and treatment plans by adopting new use of old drugs, research and development of new treatment methods, integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, etc Recommend to clinical first-line treatment; adopt multiple technical routes to promote vaccine research and development; provide scientific basis for the formulation and improvement of prevention and control strategy through the research on the living environment and transmission path of virus; build multiple animal models in a short time, providing important support for drug and vaccine research and development. At the same time, experts and scholars timely voice, answer questions and solve doubts, stabilize people's hearts and firm confidence, and provide strong scientific and technological support for winning the hard battle of epidemic prevention and control. In this major struggle, the majority of science and technology workers have fully demonstrated the fine style of hard work and dedication, rigorous and realistic professionalism, and emerged a number of advanced models.\nXi Jinping said, here, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks and sincere greetings to the vast numbers of scientists and technicians working in the forefront of epidemic prevention and control. Throughout the history of human development, science and technology is the most powerful weapon for human beings to fight against diseases. Human beings can't defeat disasters without scientific development and technological innovation. In the history of our country, there are many medical works and methods to prevent and control plague. In the second year of the first year of the first year of the Han Dynasty, it is recorded in the annals of emperor Ping of the Han Dynasty that \"the people who suffer from the disease leave their homes empty to buy medicine\" and put forward that \"isolation\" is an important measure for epidemic prevention. In the middle of Ming Dynasty, vaccination against smallpox appeared in Chin。 At the end of the 18th century, Edward chenner, a British scientist, invented the method of vaccinating against smallpox. After several generations of scientists' unremitting efforts, he finally developed a vaccine against smallpox virus. With the development of modern medical science and technology and the continuous improvement of public health infrastructure, cholera, plague, influenza and other infectious diseases that once caused great harm to human beings have gradually been effectively controlled. In recent years, science and technology have played an important role in the fight against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (mers), influenza A (H1N1), Ebola virus and other major infectious diseases.\nAccording to Xi Jinping's article, since the founding of new China, our country has made significant progress in the research, technology, platform building and personnel contingent in the field of infectious disease prevention and control through the major research and development deployment of infectious diseases. At present, hard work is still needed to win the people's war, the general war and the resistance war. The novel coronavirus pneumonia is still not fully understood in terms of the source and host, transmission route, pathogenesis, hazard lethality, diagnosis and treatment plan, treatment and sequelae. The more we face this situation, the more we must insist on asking for answers and methods from science. It is hoped that the majority of scientific and technological workers will shoulder their responsibilities and do their best to tackle the key and difficult problems in epidemic prevention and control as soon as possible, so as to provide strong scientific and technological support for winning the people's war, the general war and the resistance war in epidemic prevention and control.\nAccording to Xi Jinping, the next step is to focus on the following aspects. First, we should strengthen the combination of research and development of drugs, medical equipment and clinical treatment to effectively improve the cure rate and reduce the death rate. Second, we should promote the organic link between vaccine research and development and industrialization, so as to make full preparations for the possible normalization of prevention and control. As a special product for healthy people, vaccines are very important for epidemic prevention and control, and the safety requirements are also the first. Third, we should coordinate the research on virus tracing and transmission, and find out where the disease comes from and where it goes. Fourth, we should do a good job in the rehabilitation of patients and the psychological counseling of isolating the masses. Fifth, we should improve the system of disease prevention and control and public health research. Sixth, we should continue to carry out patriotic health campaigns. This is not a simple cleaning and sanitation, but more work should be carried out from the improvement of living environment, eating habits, social and psychological health, public health facilities and other aspects, especially to resolutely put an end to the bad habits of eating wild animals, and promote a civilized, healthy, green and environmental lifestyle.

By isolating these antibodies, a passive immunity can be provided to people who are still sick.\nThe advantage conferred by this type of immunity is its immediate action, i.e. the availability of antibodies in the patient's body shortly after administering the serum. The disadvantage is the temporary nature of antibodies in the body of patientYeah. One way to achieve active immunisation, produced by the body itself, is vaccines, which involve exposure to attenuated or inactivated pathogens (so as not to harm) or to pieces of these microorganisms, to force the body to produce antibodies against the disease",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Within five days, since Saturday, the number of infected with the new coronavirus in Europe has skyrocketed from five dozen to more than 450; the number of deaths from one to 14. And with the arrival of the coronavirus in Brazil, with a confirmation this Wednesday in Sao Paulo, Antarctica becomes the only continent without cases. This has entered a new phase in which Covid-19 is already spreading more rapidly around the world than in China.\nEven if the acceleration of the outbreak is causing concern within the European Union (EU), the situation is not, for the moment, cause for panic: the EU has again ensured on Tuesday that it is working \"on all fronts\" to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus in Europe, insisting on the need for coordination of the Member States \"in real time\" to tackle a phenomenon that is \"dynamic\".\nThe European Commission has reinforced that the key is for the EU as a whole to be \"ready\" for a possible increase in the epidemic, both in terms of treatment and in terms of containing the outbreak. One of the most sensitive issues linked to increased cases, particularly the situation in Italy, is border control, which the Commission has emphasised is not within its competence, but that of each Member State. However, such a scenario is not discarded either.\nItaly is the country most concerned by the European health authorities. This is because there has been a sudden increase in positive cases since Friday: only three people infected with the virus were accounted for on that day, but that number has since risen to 400 infected. This Wednesday was also confirmed as the twelfth victim in the country.\nThe Italian authorities are increasingly trying to tighten the siege on Covid-19: the containment measures announced this weekend for ten locations where they live for around fifty thousand people remain in forcYeah. V, Piedmont and Lombardy in northern Italy are the critical regions located in the red zone.\nFor the time being, the death pattern in Italy is similar to that in China. Older people with associated diseases, such a s cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases and others that depress the immune system, are being most affected.\nAfter Italy, Germany remains the European country with the most cases, but without new infections. France has already confirmed a total of 17 infected in the country and a second fatality: a 60-year-old French man died at dawn in Paris after being diagnosed. Norway, Austria, Croatia, Switzerland, Spain, Northern Macedonia and Greece have also confirmed new cases of infection.\nSo far, the only known case of a Portuguese infected by the new virus is that of Adriano Maranh o, the crewman of a cruise ship who was admitted to a Japanese hospital in Okazaki, about thirty miles from Tokyo. All suspected cases detected in Portugal (until this Wednesday were 18) were negative.\nThe virus that has already made more than 2760 dead (most of them in China) is now spreading at the highest speed around the world and there are already people infected in more than 40 countries. In addition to deaths in mainland China, victims are reported in Iran, South Korea, Italy, Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, France and Taiwan.\nThis Wednesday, China reported 52 deaths, the smallest daily increase in three weeks, while reporting 406 new cases, most in Hubei province. The number of new patients thus recorded a fall of 20%, compared to Monday, for example. According to the updated data by the Chinese National Health Commission, the country is adding more than 2700 dead and 78 thousand confirmed cases. Among the infected, more than 45 thousand were still active and more than 8500 patients were in serious condition. On the other hand, almost thirty thousand people have already been releaseYeah.\nAlthough Iran is the country with the most deaths from the new coronavirus after China, 139 cases of infection have been reported only last week and 19 people have died, President Hassan Rouhani said his government is not planning to quarantine cities and districts of the country.\nHowever, the authorities have already closed schools and some universities and admit to extending this decision for a few more days. There are also plans to restrict access to Shiite sacred sites this Friday. On the other hand, 11 countries have already \"closed\" their land and air borders with Iran (neighbouring Iraq, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Armenia, and other countries in the region such a s Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Georgia).\nAvoiding panic is one of the key messages from the World Health Organisation (WHO): the organisation's public health director, Maria Neira, assured this Wednesday that it is \"irrational and disproportionate\" that masks and disinfectants are exhausted in pharmacies for fear of coronavirus. In statements to the Spanish broadcaster RAC-1, Neira recalled that masks are for the use of health personnel and stressed that the decrease of victims and diseases occurring in China \"may mean that the epidemic has reached the summit and reached the epidemic peak\". On the other hand, Bruce Aylward, the specialist who led the WHO team sent to China, warned that the planet is \"not ready\" to face a pandemic of this new coronavirus.\nAs for the preparation of our country, the Foreign Minister, has assured us that we are prepared for a possible entry of the Covid-19 coronavirus. Augusto Santos Silva mentioned this Wednesday that there is a contingency plan ready to be activated in Portugal. However, it stressed that this is a global problem requiring concerted action, mainly at European levelYeah.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nAs already announced, Portugal is strengthening prevention measures and the network of available laboratories and hospitals to receive suspected cases of infection with the new coronavirus. In terms of future measures, the Portuguese Government does not rule out the closure of borders, but has strengthened that it will only do so together with the European Union, in line with the intentions of the European Commission.\nThe pneumologist and coordinator of the crisis office of the Order of Physicians, Filipe Froes, said this Wednesday to Lusa that, compared to the response capacity for influenza A ten years ago, there is now \"less hospital response capacity, less human resources and less differentiation\". \"The challenge will be much greater, but it must also be adjusted to the transmission of the disease, to the number of Portuguese affected and to gravity,\" he said, stressing that \"the challenge at this time is still unknown\"",

This is the summary of a dozen contacts made by the public to agencies and operators organising and marketing senior trips. None are officially ready to proceed with refunds and, although, as SporYoung's manager said, if there are \"enough\" calls from concerned parents, there are no cancellations.\nAlso because the note from the Directorate-General for School Settlements (Dgeste), published this Wednesday, only \"advises\" to consider visits by students abroad (in general) and Prime Minister Costa said that \"it might be advisable to avoid\" making such trips. In the absence of a specific directive, the companies in the sector, which were contacted this Thursday, were merely alert and waiting for further developments to comment more substantially on the subject.\n\"We are monitoring the development of the situation with great care and concern since its beginning in December, and monitoring the recommendations made by the competent bodies,\" said Catherine Reis of the Megafinalists (Geostar), who has two major finalist programs around Easter-Andorra and Sal o, in Catalonia, a region where a case of Covid-19 (Barcelona) has already been confirmed. The person responsible says that, \"at the moment, there is no change to the travel programme.\" The trip to Andorra has the details of sponsoring the Sumol brand. According to information from the Communication Adviser, Julio Gomes, Sumol+Compal was still analysing the data and communications of the relevant authorities on Thursday afternoon to decide whether to withdraw support, which would lead to the cancellation of the Sumol Snowtrip trip, a programme which is being carried out 15 years agoYeah.\nSporYounger, who is responsible for bringing about six thousand students to Marina d'Or (Valencian Community, already with eight recorded cases), assumes that she has received \"enough\" phone calls from \"concerned parents\" asking for more information and clarification. During those days, all the accommodation units of the Valencian tourist complex are booked by the company, so \"the destination will only have Portuguese tourists\", says the responsible one. So far, says the coordinator, Rita Veiga, have not received any request for cancellation of the reservation. The responsible officer indicates that she is in \"daily contact with the Portuguese and local authorities [Spanish] and the Portuguese Tourism\" and that, to date, they have not received any indication from any of these authorities to cancel the programme.\nRita Veiga further argues that if the event were cancelled by the authorities, it would be necessary \"to see Portugal's Tourism and the companies that have signed the health insurance of each student on whom responsibility falls\" of the reimbursements.\nAs for cases of cancellation before such indication, SporYoung coordinator refers to the general conditions published on the company website. They state that \"cancellations made less than thirty days, including the date of commencement of the journey, have 100% expenses and no value is reimbursed. With more than thirty days the customer will have to pay a minimum value of 70 per person.\"\nOne month from March to April, the event is already \"all booked and paid for\". However, Rita Veiga says \"no figures\" about possible damage from accommodation to transport, as well as the performers who are part of the programme\". A change in the fate of the event is not on the table, but the agency may \"consider changing the dates\"Yeah.\nAlso in the process of weighing are large companies selling senior trips, in the case of the Abreu Agency which, after the initial publication of this article, sent the PUBLIC a written comment: \"We have several customers calling or visiting our shops and asking questions about whether they can or should cancel,\" refers to the commercial director of the agency, Pedro Quintela.\nStressing that it clarifies and proceeds with cancellations and reimbursements \"for destinations considered by the World Health Organisation and referred to in the Community Portal as risk destinations\" (since 24/01, China, Hong and Macao; since the last weekend in Northern Italy), the responsible, As far as the senior programmes are concerned, it is already sending them to another general field, namely the package of trips to destinations which have not yet been officially considered to be at risk. \"We will examine on a case-by-case basis, managing the risk-based situations defined by the WHO. Other destinations other than those defined (by the WHO) will always have to be analysed and discussed,\"he stressed. The general practice in this case: if \"a customer wants to cancel a tourist package (...) it will only be repaid the value between the cost of the trip and the cost that the Travel Agency has already or will have with that program,\"also depending on the additional insurance cover that the customer may have purchased\".\nIn the field of the most specialized, such as the Travel Wing, which promotes eight alternate destinations for the finalists, there was still no clear position, with the company studying the subject and expecting official restrictions. Contacts with other companies such as Slide In, Student Travellers or Travel Fun could not be commented on until the time of publication of this articlYeah.\nLikewise for the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT), whose president, Pedro Costa Ferreira, admitted, even on Wednesday in a public/Renaissance interview, that it was \"reasonable\" to say that \"the sector will have a problem at Easter\". \"The big reserves are now starting in March, Easter is in April and there is no expectation of a spike in reserves with this whole environment, which has not yet reached its peak,\" he said, noting that \"the Easter effect will have a negative effect on the sector. Because, of course, if there are no reserves and there are no travel there will be less revenue, less billing.\"\nAs the aim is to ensure the \"safety of Portuguese students\", the National Youth Council (CNJ), in which several student associations also sit, indicated that it \"subscribes\" to the warning made by Dgeste.\nAs regards the dilemma open with travel agencies regarding a possible reimbursement of payments already made by households, Rita Saias considers that \"it is not for the CNJ to decide on specific cases in this context\", but leaves another warning: \"This is just one more showing the need to review the model of the overall senior trip.\"\nFor their part, the two national confederations of parents'associations have already called for \"common sense\" from the agencies contracted for the senior excursions. The destination of many senior trips is usually South Spain, where several cases of infection are already confirmed. \"This is not only about the safety of pupils, but also about the national interest in controlling the spread of the disease,\" said the President of the National Confederation of Parents'Associations (Confap), George AscentioYeah.\n\"If I had already paid, I would rather be without the money than risk my daughter contracting the infection,\" said the president of the Independent Confederation of Parents and Education Trustees (CNIPE), Rui Martins, which hopes, however, that a position of \"common sense on all sides will prevail in order to minimise the damage to all\".\nOn the other hand, the Portuguese Association for Consumer Protection, Deco refers to a text with general advice on coronavirus and travel, even without specifying anything specific about senior trips. As some agency officials have commented, the online document on package travel highlights the right to reimbursement at China and Northern Italy destinations. \"The law allows the traveler to terminate the contract at any time before starting the journey. And it will not have to pay the travel agency any cancellation fee, because there are exceptional circumstances at or near the place of destination that significantly affect the carrying out of the planned journey.\"\nBut: \"This is the only way it will be in relation to the destinations severely affected by the virus. In relation to travel insurance, in \"none of the policies analysed if it considers force majeure to cancel the trip for fear of contagion\", says Deco. \"Therefore, we cannot generally say that travel insurance can be activated due to the coronavirus. It depends on the policy and the situation to be ensured, such as the payment of medical expenses for those who have been infected during a journey, or the reimbursement of expenses for cancelling a trip, for example. Without directives expressed to other destinations, it is \"impossible to give a single answer to these questions\".\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the most profound works of the publiYeah.\n52 suspicious cases have so far been reported in Portugal, 36 of which have been negative after laboratory tests, and results are expected from the remaining 16s.

        "news_content_translate_en": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that it takes 675 million dollars (about 613 million euros) to implement a global plan to combat viruses in the next three months, this Wednesday was announced at a press conference. The WHO also revealed that experts will meet in Geneva (Switzerland) to 11 and 12 in February to set priorities in research and development of medicines, diagnostics and vaccines. So far, there are almost 25 thousand infected people and almost 500 deaths from this virus.\nFor now, the WHO has called for a fund of 675 million dollars to combat the virus in the world and in China between February and April. Of these, 60 million dollars (about 54 million euros) will be for WHO operations and the rest for those countries that are especially at risk. This is the budget for the Strategic Plan of Preparation and Response, which includes activities and resources for international organizations to combat the new coronavirus. The aim is to limit the transmission between people, especially in the most vulnerable countries, as well as to identify, isolate and care for patients early, or to minimise the economic and social impact.\n\"My greatest concern is in countries that today have no systems to operate to detect people infected by the virus,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"Urgent support is needed to reinforce health systems that detect, diagnose and protect more transmission between humans and healthcare professionals.\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the WHO, also said that \"very soon\" a WHO team will go to China.\n\"The effectiveness of the response to the outbreak depends on preparatory measures,\" said Mike Ryan, director of the WHO emergency programme. \"This is why we are seeking resources to safeguard the most vulnerable countries.\"\nOne of the big issues is also the advance in treatments for the new coronavirusYeah. So far, there's no specific drug or vaccine against the virus. Due to some speculation on the development of new treatments, the WHO has made a point of reinforcing this week that \"there are still no effective therapies against this 2019-nCoV\" and that several experts are meeting this month to set the priorities for these advances.\nAlthough there has been no specific treatment, the Chinese Government has suggested antiviral drugs used to treat HIV, such as lopinavir and ritonavir, and the inhalation of a dose of clouded interferon-alpha twice a day. Gilead Sciences is also testing an antiviral therapy for Ebola virus with patients infected with the new coronavirus.\nAs for the vaccine, scientists in Australia have developed a version of the laboratory-grown virus, which may be an important step in the development of a vaccine. Also, the Alliance for Epidemic Ready Innovations (CEPI) has already announced that three different research teams are developing vaccines and that the objective is to start clinical trials in June.\nThe Russian health minister, Mikhail Murashko, also said this Wednesday that scientists in Russia hope it will take at least eight to ten months to develop a vaccine for the virus. \"Today the process of developing a vaccine is not done in a short period of time. A vaccine is being developed in at least eight to ten months,\"he said, quoted by the Russian Interfax News Agency. Last week, Russia announced that it was working on a vaccine with China.\nThe choice of a new name for this virus, temporarily designated 2019-nCoV by the WHO, may appear somewhat smaller. \"The name [official] of the new virus is very late because the focus so far has been on public health response,\" said Crystal Watson, professor at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Safety (USA), cited on the BBC websitYeah. However, there are some reasons why the name choice becomes more of a priority. \"When we do not have an official name, there is a danger that people will start using terms like'Chinese virus'and that they may create a negative reaction against certain populations.\"\nThe International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) is responsible for choosing the name. According to the Committee's guidelines, the name shall not include geographical locations, names of persons, the name of an animal or type of food, or references to a culture or industry. This name should be short and descriptive, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). A group from ICTV is already deliberating on the new name.\nOfficial names can also become a problem. Moreover, in 2015, WHO criticised the name MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as it could provoke, for example, a negative reaction against members of religious and ethnic communities.\nThere is still a lot to uncover about the virus, but one of the data that is thought to be already acquired is what transmission can occur in the period before the onset of symptoms. Initially, one of the strongest evidence for this hypothesis came from a Chinese woman who had had a meeting in Munich: she would have infected other people and would have had symptoms only days later. This situation was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. However, the researchers had only relied on the accounts of German patients. The Robert Koch Institute, the German public health agency, and the Bavarian Food Safety and Health Authority spoke to the Chinese patient and were now informed that she still had symptoms during her stay in Germany. Despite this new information, other data substantiate the hypothesis that asymptomatic transmission takes place.\nThis Wednesday also announced the case of the youngest person infected with the new coronaviruYeah. The Chinese media reported that a baby was diagnosed with the virus only thirty hours after birth, referred to in the English newspaper The Guardian. According to Chinese state television CCTV, the virus had been detected in the baby's mother before delivery. This Wednesday also confirmed four more cases in Singapore, including a six-month-old baby.\nAlso on the transmission of the virus, it was confirmed in the last week that a doctor who issued an alert on the coronavirus is also infected. The story of this ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang, began in mid-December when he wrote a message in his group of college friends. In this message, you said that in your hospital there were seven patients with SARS-like symptoms. He would also ask that his friends and their families be careful.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nAs the message eventually went viral, the police accused him of spreading rumors, which could lead to his arrest for seven years. According to the Spanish newspaper El Pais, seven other doctors received the same warning. The doctor eventually had to sign a statement in which he assumed his failure and promised not to do the same again. A few days later, he became infected with the new coronavirus after treating a patient.\nThe new coronavirus has not yet arrived in Africa, but the African Disease Control and Prevention Centres have already activated their emergency operations center to tackle the virus and are organising a workshop in Senegal for 15 African countries.\nAn isolation wing is ready in the hospital in Khartoum, Sudan. Laboratories in Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Madagascar or Sierra Leone already have the equipment to detect the viruYeah. Passengers arriving at Cameroon or Gambia airports are being monitored for fever and other viral symptoms. The Democratic Republic of Congo has already prevented its citizens from travelling to China. Burkina Faso asked Chinese citizens to postpone their trips.

The confirmed cases also increased to 830 only in China, revealed this Friday the National Health Commission. According to the Chinese authorities, there are 1072 suspicious cases.\nThe last confirmed death occurred near the Russian border in Heilongjiang (in the northeast of the country), local authorities told the French-Presse news agency without providing further details. This province is located more than six hundred kilometers from the city of Wuhan, where it is thought this virus may have originated.\nOver Thursday, more deaths were known outside Hubei Province. In Hebei, a province bordering Beijing, the local health committee said that an 80-year-old man died after returning from a two-month stay in Wuhan.\nThe confirmed cases and suspected infection are multiplying at various points around the globe:\nIn the United Kingdom 14 people have been subjected to medical examinations on suspicion of infection with the new coronavirus. Five of the citizens have not detected the presence of the virus, the remaining nine still await the results.\nAccording to sources from the Spanish Ministry of Health, two people are currently being examined in Spain for suspected infection with the new coronavirus. Both citizens recently returned to the country after a trip to China. Authorities ensure that results will be known within 24 hours, although \"there is no sign that they are positive\".\nA little across the country measures are being taken to contain the spread of this coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, just a few days from the celebration of the Chinese New Year. Several New Year's events have been cancelled, including in MacaYeah.\nAt least ten cities in Hubei Province, with a 60 million population whose capital is Wuhan, have quarantined and imposed movement restrictions, and many cities have completely suspended transport services. In Wuhan, for example, there is no bus, metro or boat service and all planes and trains to other cities have been cancelled.\nIn Shanghai, the Disney resort temporarily closed as \"response to the outbreak\", stated the reporting chain. In Beijing, the Forbidden City is also closed.\nMacao announced this Friday the suspension of services, the closure of cultural and sporting spaces, and the postponement of the return to classes by at least February. All school competitions and activities have been suspended or cancelled. Some museums will be closed from Saturday and with no opening date. On Thursday, the head of the Macao government also admitted that the casinos in the territory, the world capital of the game, may be forced to close if the contagion situation deteriorates in the territory.\nThe financial rating agency Fitchs Ratings has already warned that the worsening epidemic of Wuhan's coronavirus could expose Macao and Hong Kong's economies, with negative prospects: \"If Wuhan's viral outbreak increases sharply, we believe the macroeconomic effects would initially be the most felt in Asia, where the virus originated. Services sector activity, particularly in tourism-related areas, would be the most vulnerable, which could leave exposed economies such as Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore, as well as Hong Kong and Macao, both of which already have negative prospects\", said Fitch in a statement to Lusa.\nThe Wuhan Metropolitan Region is building a 25.000 square metre hospital to welcome patients from the outbreak, writes the BBYeah. The special hospital prepared to accommodate 1000-bed openings scheduled for February-3 brings together medical resources to provide isolated and efficient treatment for infected patients, according to the Chinese news agency Xinhua. Coronvirus patients are being treated in several hospitals and in 61 clinics in Wuhan, the same agency said.\nIn order to combat this new outbreak, China also created a national research team of 14 experts to help prevent and control the latest coronavirus outbreak in China, this Friday announced the Ministry of Science and Technology, quoted by the Lusa agency. The antivirus research team is part of the Ministry's emergency science and technology project, which was launched together with the National Health Commission and other departments. According to Xinhua, the project serves to provide scientific support for materials in virus tracking, transmission, detection methods, genome evolution and vaccine development.\nIn the treatment and control of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which spread rapidly on the Chinese continent between 2002 and 2003, Beijing built Xiaotangshan Hospital, a temporary medical center in the northern suburb of the city.

        "news_content_translate_en": "1/GIVE NO QUARTER  \n Few will regret the end of the first 2020 quarter. Fears of a U.S.-Iran war gave way to the coronavirus pandemic which JPMorgan reckons will have pushed the world economy into a 12% contraction over January to March. The quarter saw the most brutal global equity collapse since the Great Depression, exacerbated by a 60% oil price slump.  \n April may not bring much relief, with coronavirus still spreading rapidly and keeping large parts of the global economy shuttered. Banks have rushed to slash Q2 forecasts too, so expect more turbulence on financial markets.  \n The cavalry has arrived though. G20 governments have promised a $5 trillion revival effort, major central banks have slashed rates and restarted asset purchases. Markets have bounced big and may actually end Q1 on a high. What we need now is to see infection rates peaking and that will show whether April falls, or if it's indeed time for spring.  \n  \n (Graphic: World stocks vs. COVID-19 confirmed cases, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/4023/3979/msci.png)  \n  \n 2/PANDEMIC PAYROLLS:  \n Through years of stubbornly low economic growth and inflation, the brightest spot was the U.S. labour market, with unemployment reaching half-century lows. Coronavirus may have ended that boom.  \n With infections surging, cities in lockdown, businesses downing shutters and most travel on ice, staff layoffs are likely to mushroom. That showed up in the number of Americans filing unemployment benefit claims which hit a record of more than 3 million. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise to 1 million, though some estimates were as high as 4 million.  \n Now the wait is on for Friday's non-farm payrolls figures that will offer a snapshot of the jobs picture over March. The government's unprecedented $2 trillion fiscal expansion package includes a $500 billion fund to help hard-hit industries and a comparable amount to fund direct payments of up to $3,000 apiece to U.S. families.  \n Economists expect the payroll data to show a loss of 293,000 jobs - the largest monthly drop since July 2009. A significant overshoot of that and the $2 trillion stimulus approved by Congress could suddenly start to look inadequate.  \n  \n (Graphic: Pandemic payrolls, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3945/3901/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 3/CHINA'S PYRRHIC VICTORY  \n The world's factory is re-opening, but the market is closed and the shoppers are gone.  \n China's social isolation policies appear to have contained the coronavirus at home, allowing work and travel to resume. But major economic damage may be yet to come. With infections climbing exponentially in the United States, Europe and the other markets China exports to, and with supply chains in disarray, China is getting neither the imported components it needs nor demand for its products.  \n Already Chinese factories' Jan-Feb profits have hit their lowest in a decade and upcoming manufacturing surveys will very likely reveal more pain. And just like everywhere else, job losses are mounting up, regardless of how many cheap loans are being offered to businesses. Expectations are now for the economy to contract this quarter but many economists reckon 2020 growth will be around 2% - a third of the \"around 6%\" authorities target.  \n  \n (Graphic: China's Industrial profits shrinking, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/9258/9170/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 4/COME TOGETHER, RIGHT NOW  \n The European Central Bank has done its bit to tackle the virus damage, having massively expanded asset purchases, agreed to more flexibility on the share of bonds it buys from each country and buffered borrowing costs for weaker euro zone states such as Italy. Now it's up to European Union leaders to come together.  \n So far there is no united front: they've failed to agree on the scale of support for economies ravaged by the outbreak. The ECB's aggressive action gives them some breathing space but, as of now, politicians are wrangling over setting up a credit line worth some 2% of annual output from the euro area bailout fund.  \n Many European governments urge the issuance of a joint debt instrument to face a crisis which Goldman Sachs economists estimate may shrink the euro economy by 9% this year. But Germany and some others oppose that. At stake, says France's Emmanuel Macron, is the survival of the European project. The crisis, for sure, is far from over.  \n  \n (Graphic: 10-year bond yield spreads over Germany, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/4030/3986/DE2703.png)  \n  \n 5/FRONTIERS ON THE EDGE  \n It's been a tough time for riskier assets in recent weeks, including emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies. But few have felt the pain as much as frontier markets, a subset of smaller and often riskier emerging economies.  \n Many of those frontier economies are in Africa, and are suffering from a toxic combination of tumbling oil and commodity prices, the prospect of the global economy tumbling into recession and weakening currencies which will make servicing external debt ever-more expensive.  \n Oil-producing countries like Angola, Ghana, Gabon and Nigeria have seen their dollar-denominated debt drop sharply, with yields of some issues shooting above 20%, indicating soaring borrowing costs. Many countries on the continent lack the financial firepower or foreign currency reserves needed to combat the coronavirus and prop up their economies, with healthcare systems already under strain.  \n The World Bank and International Monetary Fund on Wednesday urged official bilateral creditors to provide immediate debt relief to the world's poorest countries as they grapple with the human and economic consequences of the pandemic.  \n Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies pledged on Thursday to inject over $5 trillion into the global economy to limit job and income losses from the coronavirus and \"do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic\", expressing concern about Africa in particular. Many hope that the acknowledgement of the need to bolster global financial safety nets and national health systems will translate into action.  \n  \n (Graphic: Africa's soaring borrowing costs, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3971/3927/Africa's%20soaring%20borrowing%20costs.jpg) REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "As the Covid-19 pandemic runs its course and wreaks havoc worldwide, the numbers look bleak. Nearly 500,000 people have been infected, and more than 21,000 had died as of Thursday (March 26). \n The international system has reverted to every country for itself, as borders have gone up and globalisation has come down. The world as we knew it is unlikely to be the same, but regions as they were remain relevant. \n The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), as the region’s grouping, must face up to the crisis together or risk being torn apart by it. \n Having gone through the thick and thin of international affairs for more than 52 years, Asean's resilience is self-evident. \n Its first two decades were beset by ideological divisions between Indochina and the rest, but since then Asean has managed to make itself the centre of a broader Asian regionalism, playing an architectural role to promote regional peace and stability by setting up a host of cooperative vehicles and mechanisms —  from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in 1989 to the East Asia Summit and Asean Defence Ministers' Meeting Plus more recently. \n But Asean has never faced anything like Covid-19. This is a fast-spreading public health crisis in a region with weak healthcare systems. Case numbers in Southeast Asia so far appear suspect with a lot of downside risks. \n Thailand's infections have surged past 1,000, while Malaysia's is approaching 1,800. A country of 270 million, Indonesia has reported fewer than 800 infections thus far. \n The Philippines, with its population of 110 million, also have reported well below 1,000, and only a handful of cases were reported in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. \n Mortality rates have remained under international benchmarks of 3-4 per cent, based on established numbers of infections. \n What is troubling for Asean is that these numbers likely stem from under-reporting, and will probably rise alarmingly in the weeks ahead. \n To Asean, as a region of 660 million with an aspiring economic community, the coronavirus is an existential danger. Based on known facts, figures and trends, it is not far-fetched to estimate that many millions of people across Asean will come down with the disease. \n Too many could perish in the process, as healthcare systems in less developed Asean countries, such as Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, become overwhelmed. \n For Thailand, these three mainland Southeast Asian countries are particularly crucial, because the Thai economy relies on their migrant labourers. \n Asean has banked itself on its development potential and its geostrategic location straddling Northeast Asia, South Asia, and the Asia-Pacific, and Europe. \n It is the fastest-growing region in the world, with a growth trajectory of more than 5 per cent. \n Its internal market comprises relatively young demographics and rising middle classes with increasing purchasing power. \n Although domestic politics are contentious in almost all Asean countries, the region is devoid of cross-border conflict. \n What Asean aspires to be can come to naught if the Covid-19 pandemic is not contained. The disease is making its rounds in waves through countries, with potential reruns. \n The public health crisis is just the beginning, as its impact will spill over into the socio-economic realm — from social re-adjustments due to increased mental and physical isolation to economic recessions and possibly an outright depression, depending on how wide and deep the pandemic runs and how governments responses around the world respond to it. \n Compared to the devastating 1997-98 economic crisis in Southeast Asia, Covid-19 may actually be much worse. \n Back in the late 1990s, Southeast Asian economies, especially Thailand and Indonesia, could find a lender of last resort in the International Monetary Fund and turn to external demand for economic recovery. \n This time, the global market will not be ready and demand won't be enough to prop up Asean's growth and recovery. \n At the minimum, what Asean needs is transparency and coordination. Asean member states must come clean about their number of cases and roll out wider testing. \n Some Asean countries, such as Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, have imposed virtual lockdowns to slow the coronavirus' spread, but this should be considered for the entire region for a limited period. If not, Asean's pronouncements on health sector cooperation as part of the Asean Vision 2025 will be rendered moot. \n Singapore has led the way by biting the bullet early on and imposing travel restrictions and social distancing measures. In fact, its vigilant handling of the Covid-19 outbreak is being used as an example for other countries. \n Thailand and Malaysia, behind the curve until recently, are following suit. Vietnam, as Asean chair, also has tried to stay on top of the outbreak, having come up with and exported affordable Covid-19 test kits. \n Once Asean's more medically-equipped members manage to contain their outbreaks, they should start helping their other Asean neighbours, as the disparity and inequality between Asean's members are well-known. \n Covid can do a lot of damage across Southeast Asia, but unless Asean responds as a region, the pneumonia-like disease will keep circulating among its 10 members for much longer. \n While Asean has to treat Covid-19 as a regional challenge, the 10-member grouping also has to avoid being further divided by the geopolitics of the coronavirus. \n China appears to have seen the worst of the outbreak and is now extending assistance to other afflicted countries. To reciprocate Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's demonstration of friendship in early February, Beijing sent loads of medical supplies to Cambodia —  similar moves in the future may end up dividing Asean members. \n Asean thus must come to grips with three layers of challenges. First, each Asean member has to be strict about exposing and addressing Covid-19 cases within their borders. \n Then, the whole of Asean must respond to Covid-19 as a united region, through information sharing and effective policy coordination to prevent the disease from returning. \n And last but not least, Asean must find ways not to let external players use the outbreak to further divide Asean. \n Indeed, unless it is dealt with squarely and firmly, Covid-19 has the capacity to undo all of Asean's achievements.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Get TODAY's top news stories via Telegram:  \n SINGAPORE — Singapore Airlines (SIA) will be trying to raise S$15 billion of funds by issuing new shares to its shareholders, firstly through offering S$5.3 billion in new equity and up to S$9.7 billion of 10-year mandatory convertible bonds.  \n Existing shareholders can buy these new issuances proportionate to the amount of SIA shares they are already holding, and these shares will be treated as equity in SIA’s balance sheet.  \n In a press release in the early hours of Friday (March 27), Singapore’s national carrier said that its largest shareholder, Temasek Holdings, will vote in favour of SIA’s plans and buy all remaining shares and bonds, in addition to the full amount it is entitled to. \n The state investment firm owns about 55 per cent of SIA.  \n The money raised from these issuances will be used to fund capital and operational expenditure requirements, the airline said.  \n More than 1.7 billion of the shares to be issued will be offered at S$3 each, which is more than 50 per cent lower than SIA’s last closing share price at S$6.50 on Wednesday. \n The bonds will be offered over a few tranches, with S$3.5 billion issued first, while the rest will take place over the subsequent months. \n SIA also said that it has arranged a S$4 billion bridge loan facility with DBS bank — another portfolio company of Temasek — which would help support its near-term liquidity needs.  \n The statement from the airline came after Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said in Parliament on Thursday that it is considering a corporate action which would be supported by Temasek.  \n “I welcome Temasek’s decision to lend support to SIA. SIA is an outstanding airline and a strategic asset for Singapore. \n “Through the government support for the aviation sector and if necessary, more direct support measures, we will make sure that SIA is able to come through this in good shape,” Mr Heng said when he was unveiling more measures for the aviation sector hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic.  \n The coronavirus that has infected more than 410,000 people across more than 190 countries has simultaneously wreaked havoc on the aviation industry globally, with demand for international air travel obliterated and governments closing their borders to curb the spread of the disease which had its first outbreak in Wuhan, China. \n SIA has not been spared and has had to implement cost-cutting measures recently, as its chief executive officer Goh Choon Pong announced that he would take a 30 per cent pay cut and others in senior management also taking a 20 to 25 per cent pay cut.  \n Its pilots will be required to take up to seven days of no-pay leave a month from April, while other staff members will have to take one to two days of no-pay leave between April and May.  \n On Thursday morning, the airline announced a trading halt. \n Earlier this week, SIA said that it will ground almost all its fleet that was originally scheduled until the end of April.  \n The aviation industry supports more than 12 per cent of Singapore’s gross domestic product and 375,000 jobs. \n SIA, SilkAir and Scoot account for more than half of the passengers flying in and out of Changi Airport, SIA said. \n SIA chairman Peter Seah said: “This is an exceptional time for the SIA Group. Since the onset of the Covid-19 outbreak, passenger demand has fallen precipitously amid an unprecedented closure of borders worldwide.  \n “We are especially grateful for Temasek’s strong vote of confidence. The Board is confident that this package of new funding will ensure that SIA is equipped with the resources to overcome the current challenges, and be in a position of strength to grow and reinforce our leadership in the aviation sector.” \n Mr Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara, chief executive officer of Temasek International, the management and investment arm of Temasek Holdings, said: “This transaction will not only tide SIA over a short-term financial liquidity challenge, but will position it for growth beyond the pandemic”. \n ",

The massive rescue package, which would be the largest ever passed by Congress, goes to the House of Representatives for a vote on Friday.  \n  \n Time-out in U.S.-China blame game ahead of G20 summit  \n China and the United States have agreed to set aside their differences ahead of the G20 summit to discuss the coronavirus, the South China Morning Post reported, citing a diplomatic source familiar with preparatory talks.  \n U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's accusations that China is delaying the sharing of information, and his reference to the coronavirus as a \"Chinese virus\" - a term President Donald Trump has used - have angered Beijing.  \n But the message may not have reached the U.S. ambassador to Britain. In an interview with the London Times, he doubled down on criticism of China, accusing it of trying to cover up the epidemic and putting millions at risk.  \n  \n The spread  \n There are more than 470,000 cases in 200 countries and territories, Reuters figures tallied at 0200 GMT on Thursday showed. Ninety of these places have 100 cases or more.  \n Deaths linked to the virus rose by 2,400 to more than 21,000 worldwide. Italy recorded the most in the latest daily figures, with over 680 deaths. The death rate in Spain is also very high.  \n The United States has taken over from Italy as the country reporting the most new cases. It now accounts for roughly a third of all new cases reported in the past day, with almost 15,000 infections, and over 260 new deaths.  \n The disease has killed more than 900 people in the United States.  \n  \n Leave now, Australia tells cruise ships  \n Australia ordered two cruise ships to leave its waters on Thursday, after a liner that docked in Sydney Harbour last week became the primary source of infection.  \n Cruise ships have become a flashpoint after 147 of 2,700 passengers who were allowed to disembark from Carnival Corp's Ruby Princess later tested positive for COVID-19.  \n  \n Prince Charles did not \"jump the queue\" for testing  \n A junior British health minister defended Prince Charles and Britain's coronavirus testing procedures on Thursday, saying the heir to the throne did not \"jump the queue\" when he was tested and found positive for the disease.  \n When asked why Charles had a test while millions of frontline health workers have not, Edward Argar told Sky News: \"My understanding is that his symptoms, his condition, met that criteria... The Prince of Wales didn't jump the queue,\" he said.  \n  \n Coronavirus leaves Paris street in 1940s time warp  \n A Parisian neighbourhood has been left stuck in a World War Two time-warp after the makers of a 1940s-era film had to abandon their set before France went into a lockdown.  \n War propaganda and Socialist posters are plastered on walls along the cobbled Rue Androuet, in the Montmartre district, now lined by a mock jeweller's store, tailor and off-licence in war-time decor. German road signs point towards medical facilities.  \n \"Just in case quarantined Paris wasn't disorienting enough: my neighbourhood was being used as a film set when the lockdown hit. Now the whole block has been frozen in 1941,\" resident Tim McInerney wrote on Twitter. REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BRASILIA/SAO PAULO - Brazil declared a state of emergency on Friday, freeing up funds for the federal government to fight the coronavirus pandemic, as President Jair Bolsonaro's popularity declined over his handling of the crisis.  \n The Senate approved a measure letting the government waive fiscal targets this year, with senators voting remotely after two of them tested positive for the virus causing the COVID-19 respiratory disease.  \n Bolsonaro is wrestling to balance mounting public health concerns while shielding an economy he had vowed to revive. In comments to journalists he slammed state governors for taking \"extreme measures\" against the pandemic that hurt the economy.  \n The president said he expected June to be the most critical month for the coronavirus outbreak in Latin America's largest country, where seven people have already died of the disease and over 600 cases have been confirmed, doubling in two days.  \n Brazil's two biggest cities, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and their surrounding states have moved to slow the outbreak by restricting social gatherings in a push to empty shopping malls, beaches and public transportation.  \n Bolsonaro has banned entry for citizens from China and the European Union, but has held back from closing international airports as Latin American neighbors Colombia, Peru, Argentina and Venezuela have done.  \n The epidemic poses serious political risks for the far-right populist Bolsonaro, who has been criticized for his handling of the outbreak, which he initially labeled a \"fantasy.\"  \n Approval of Bolsonaro's government fell to a record low this week, according to XP Investimentos poll released on Friday. Just 30% of those surveyed rated his administration \"good\" or \"great,\" compared with 36% calling it \"bad\" or \"awful.\"  \n A record-high 17% said his government is to blame for the current economic situation, as blame attached to the previous three administrations slowly evaporates, the poll showed.  \n Many Brazilians have been drumming pots and pans in their homes nightly in a traditional protest against Bolsonaro, who ignored medical advice to meet crowds of supporters on Sunday despite having several aides diagnosed with virus.  \n Bolsonaro, who was already struggling to resuscitate a weak economy, looked to blame state governors on Friday for the economic impact of the virus. Brazil's currency and stock market were among the world's biggest losers over the past two weeks.  \n \"(Governors) are taking extreme measures that aren't in their purview ... commerce stops and people don't have anything to eat,\" he told reporters outside his official residence, \"the medicine has to be proportional (to the illness), or it kills.\"  \n Rio Governor Wilson Witzel on Thursday said he would cancel all international flights in and out of the state, as well as domestic flights to Brazilian states with coronavirus cases.  \n But airlines and federal regulators said he does not have the power to do it. Infrastructure Minister Tarciso Freitas said the federal government will not close airports and bus stations.  \n \"We can't enter into a state of panic,\" Bolsonaro said.  \n The president also looked to defuse a diplomatic spat with No.1 trading partner China that began when his son, lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, blasted the Asian country for how it handled the initial outbreak of the virus.  \n \"There is no problem with China,\" Bolsonaro told reporters outside his official residence. He said he might reach out to China to get equipment for fighting the outbreak. \"If I have to call the Chinese president, I'll call. No problem,\" he said.  \n The governor of Brazil's capital district, Ibaneis Rocha, has already asked China for help.  \n Rocha wrote to Chinese Ambassador Yang Wanming in a letter seen by Reuters, asking for advice and equipment to fight the disease in Brasilia, where there are 84 confirmed cases.

We had to return them\", said at a press conference this morning the director of the Centre for the Coordination of Alerts and Health Emergency at the Spanish Ministry of Health, Fernando Simon.\nSpain is the second country in the world with the most dead with the covid-19 and the use of rapid tests last weekend to spread the early detection of the number of infected as widely as possible.\nThe Chinese embassy in Madrid informed, through its Twitter social network account, that the rapid tests that Spain purchased were not valid because the supplying company did not have an official licence from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration.\nChinese representation assures that the Spanish Government did not follow China's recommendations, which provided the country's health services with \"a list of recommendations on qualified suppliers\", in which Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology was not included.\nQuestioned by the Express, the Ministry of Health explained that Portugal only acquired \"PCR tests, which in real time have high sensitivity and specificity\". PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is the English acronym for Polimerase Chain Reaction, a technique for amplification of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) without using living organisms and which are more complex than the said rapid tests, which detect antibodies, i.e., substances produced by the immune system in response to the viruYeah.\n\"These tests [so-called PCR] will be distributed to different laboratories in the country, depending on their needs and compatibility with the equipment\", details source of the Ministry of Health, which adds that rapid tests \"detecting virus antibodies in the blood do not fit the diagnosis of acute cases, Since it is only from the 10th day after the onset of infection that they allow a positive response\".\nHowever, the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SEIMC) also reported that the first rapid tests that arrived in Spain were less than 30% sensitive in detecting the covid-19, results that \"would prevent its introduction into the routine\".\nThe organization recognizes that the quick diagnosis of cases is relevant to the prompt identification, isolation and treatment of infected patients and to limit the transmission of the virus as well as to the decongement of intensive care units.\n\"To this end, we need rapid tests with high sensitivity\", underlines SEIMC, adding that the first rapid tests for detecting the virus antigen that arrived in Spain are not appropriate for this purpose.\nIn statements to Lusa, the microbiology professor at the Autonomous University of Madrid Jose Antonio Lopez Guerrero admits that \"what happened has a certain logic in an emergency situation in which the usual controls relax\" due to lack of time.\n\"Rapid tests are not because they are fast, they have to be less reliable\", he explained, adding that they are reaction-based exams that lack the same \"sensitivity\" as normal tests, which instead of one to two days take longer to know the result.\nFor this university teacher, you can admit \"failures to a certain extent\", but at a minimum of \"80% must be reliable and a 30% sensitivity cannot be accepted as sending madeYeah.\nFor its part, the Epidemiology professor at the European University of Valencia Patricia Guillem, also in statements to Lusa, stated that \"the faster the less reliable tests are\", but defended their importance in detecting possible infections early, and then it was necessary to run a normal test.\n\"You cannot invest at this time on a large scale in tests that take much longer to be known the result\", he added.\nSpain has recorded, in the last 24-hour period, 655 dead with the new coronavirus, taking the overall balance to 4.089 fatalities, according to the daily update made today by the health authorities of the country",

The border will not be closed, he said.  \n \"No, we're not going to close it, but we are invoking a certain provision that will allow us great latitude as to what we do,\" he said.  \n Trump has made staunching the flow of migrants across the border with Mexico a central pillar of his presidency and has poured billions of dollars into building a border wall that is far from completed.  \n Immigrant rights groups have slammed the idea of mass returns of foreign nationals to Mexico.  \n Trump said a hospital ship will be sent to hard-hit New York to help people affected by the contagion, and that a second hospital ship will be deployed on the West Coast.  \n He defended his description of the coronavirus as \"the Chinese virus\" despite concerns among some Americans that he was making an ethnic slur.  \n \"It’s not racist, not at all. It comes from China,\" he said of the illness, whose origin has been traced back to Wuhan, China.  \n Trump, appearing in the White House briefing room for what has now become a daily news conference with his coronavirus task force, said he would sign the Defense Production Act later on Wednesday.  \n The law, which dates back to the Korean War of the 1950s, grants the president broad authority to \"expedite and expand the supply of resources from the U.S. industrial base to support military, energy, space, and homeland security programs,\" according to a summary on the Federal Emergency Management Agency website.  \n Reuters was first to report last month that Trump's action was being considered. (https://reut.rs/2U0TVqk)  \n “We will be invoking the Defense Production Act just in case we need it,\" said Trump.  \n Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin fanned fears of economic collapse on Wednesday by telling lawmakers on Capitol Hill that 20 percent unemployment was an extreme possibility should the virus have devastating effects on American businesses, many of which are already under duress.  \n \"That’s an absolute total worst case scenario,\" said Trump. \"We're nowhere near it.\"  \n Vice President Mike Pence, head of the coronavirus task force, urged all Americans to put off elective surgery to allow hospitals to concentrate on the rising influx of patients with the COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the new virus.  \n Deborah Birx, a member of the task force, urged young people to adhere to government guidelines, calling for a 15-day effort to slow the spread of the virus. Young people are considered key transmitters of the virus, which can be passed along even with mild or no symptoms.  \n There are now more than 7,300 U.S. cases of the illness and at least 118 deaths.

Here is a selection of measures countries are taking to prepare for the virus and limit its spread.  \n  \n SOUTH AFRICA  \n With more cases than any other country in sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa is barring entry to foreign travellers coming from or transiting through high-risk countries including Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Germany, France, Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom and China, according to an advisory issue by the foreign ministry on Tuesday.  \n Travellers who arrived from these countries since mid-February must report for testing. Those arriving from medium-risk countries – Portugal, Hong Kong and Singapore – will undergo high intensity screening.  \n South Africans are advised to cancel or postpone all non-essential foreign travel. The government has also ordered schools to close early for the Easter break and will prohibit gatherings of more than 100 people.  \n  \n NIGERIA  \n Africa's most populous nation is from Friday banning entry to arrivals from 13 of the countries worst affected by the coronavirus, including the United States, Britain, Germany and China.  \n It has also stepped up surveillance and is preparing for the possibility of an influx of patients.  \n Lagos, the biggest city with some 20 million people, could handle 2,000 cases, said Bamidele Mutiu, who heads a regional biosafety team. To do this, they would need to use two camps previously housing people displaced by violence, he said.  \n Authorities are checking the temperature of anyone who arrives at Nigeria's airports, ports and land borders.  \n Those coming from high-risk countries such as China, Iran, Italy and Spain are asked to self-isolate for 14 days, said Tarik Mohammed, a technical advisor at the Niger Centre for Disease Control. If they develop symptoms, a laboratory team will visit them and collect a sample for testing.  \n  \n KENYA  \n The East African country is suspending travel from any nation with reported COVID-19 cases.  \n Only Kenyan citizens, foreigners with residence permits and United Nations workers will be allowed to come in, provided they proceed on self-quarantine, the government said this week.  \n Schools and universities are closing, and public minibuses are providing hand sanitizer.  \n  \n ETHIOPIA  \n Ethiopian Airlines said on its website that medics stationed at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, a key regional transit hub, carry out continuous health screenings 24/7.  \n The government in the Horn of Africa country has closed schools nationwide and offered to transport people on government buses to ease congestion on public transport.  \n  \n RWANDA  \n The East African country is flooding its capital, Kigali, with portable sinks for hand-washing at bus stops, restaurants, banks and shops. Schools, universities, churches and courts are closed nationwide. Some flights are suspended.  \n  \n CAMEROON  \n From Wednesday, Cameroon, in central Africa, will close land, air and sea borders indefinitely, the government said in statement on Tuesday. International flights will be grounded, with the exception of cargo planes. Schools and restaurants will shut, and gatherings of more than 50 people are banned.  \n  \n LIBERIA  \n The West African country is applying lessons learned fighting a devastating Ebola outbreak in 2014-15.  \n \"We were one of the first countries to start enhanced screening at the airport on Jan. 25,\" said Mosoka P. Fallah, acting director general of the National Public Health Institute of Liberia.  \n More than 200 people have been trained as field epidemiologists and check for diseases in all 90 districts, said Tolbert Nyenswah, senior research associate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the United States and former incident manager for Liberia’s Ebola response.  \n \"If there is a case of a suspected disease, a sample is sent to a lab and tested.\"  \n There are hand-washing stations at public places including stores, shops, schools, hospitals, restaurant and government offices.  \n  \n SENEGAL  \n Has been taking all passengers' temperatures since Jan. 28 and asks for contact details, so officials can reach them if someone else on the plane tests positive, a spokesman for Dakar airport said.  \n  \n GHANA  \n Has implemented some of the most stringent measures in West Africa with a mandatory 14 days of quarantine for all people arriving from abroad. Travelers from countries with over 200 cases of coronavirus are barred from entering the country unless they are Ghanaian citizens or residents.  \n  \n MAURITANIA  \n After confirming its first case on March 13, the West African country closed the international airport, suspended teaching in schools and universities, and banned weekly markets.  \n  \n MADAGASCAR  \n One of the world’s poorest countries, the island nation has suspended all flights for 30 days, a blow to its tourism industry.

This is really a terrible blow to the economies of the whole world.” \n While the 1997 crisis affected millions of people as economies contracted and currencies plunged, Malaysia was better off, rebounding economically in just one year. \n Much of it was credited to Dr Mahathir who was the architect of Malaysia’s capital controls in 1998. \n “This time, pegging the exchange rate won’t help. \n “Investor confidence is very low not only for Malaysia, it’s for the whole world,” he was quoted as saying. \n “Because if you invest and you cannot sell, you don’t invest.” \n After a recent political crisis, Mr Muhyiddin Yassin is now the prime minister. \n However, Dr Mahathir said he has doubt over the new government’s ability to steer the country to recovery. \n “This is the wrong time to take over the government. \n “The country has never been in such a state before.” \n Other world leaders have also issued similar warnings. \n European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde had said the economic fallout could be as bad as the 2008 global financial crisis, while Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the pandemic economic fallout might be worse. \n On Sunday (March 15), 190 new Covid-19 cases had been confirmed in Malaysia alone, the largest single-day increase in the number of confirmed cases. \n Meanwhile, China has logged more than 80,800 cases, but most patients have recovered and there are now fewer than 10,000 infected people. \n The country’s progress contrasts with the growing crisis abroad, with the worldwide death toll surpassing 6,000 as Italy recorded its biggest one-day rise in fatalities. \n With 368 deaths, Italy’s grim figure was higher than any single-day toll reported in China.

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON - The U.S. State Department summoned the Chinese ambassador to the United States on Friday to protest against comments by Beijing suggesting the U.S. military might have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, as tensions between the two global powers over the outbreak intensified.  \n David Stillwell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, delivered a very \"stern representation\" to China's ambassador Cui Tiankai, a State Department official said, adding that Beijing's envoy was \"very defensive.\"  \n The State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said China was seeking to deflect criticism of its role in \"starting a global pandemic and not telling the world.\"  \n \"Spreading conspiracy theories is dangerous and ridiculous. We wanted to put the government on notice we won't tolerate it for the good of the Chinese people and the world.\"  \n Defence Department Spokeswoman Alyssa Farah wrote on Twitter on Friday that \"the Communist Party of China has chosen to promulgate false & absurd conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 blaming U.S. service members. #ChinaPropaganda\"  \n The virus, also called COVID-19, has infected 138,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,000.  \n China's embassy did not respond to requests for comment.  \n Despite the signs of tension, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Beijing on Friday for its \"data sharing\".  \n Asked by a reporter during a White House news conference about \"odd narratives\" being offered by some Chinese officials, Trump appeared to brush off any concern, saying he had read one article on the subject, but that he did not think it was representative of his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.  \n Trump, who in a national address this week called the outbreak a \"foreign virus\" that started in China, added: \"They know where it came from, we all know where it came from.\"  \n Tensions escalated after Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian took to Twitter on Thursday.  \n \"When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!\" Zhao tweeted in English.  \n The episode is the latest in an increasing war of words between Washington and Beijing, whose already strained ties over issues including trade, intellectual property rights and press freedom have further been tested by the virus outbreak.  \n The coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, pummelling financial markets, halting industry, bringing some flights to a standstill, closing schools and forcing the postponement of sports events and concerts.  \n Zhao's comments came days after Robert O'Brien, the U.S. national security adviser, said China had reacted slowly to the coronavirus, probably costing the world two months when it could have been preparing.  \n Wuhan was ground zero for the outbreak, which the World Health Organization this week labelled a pandemic. It has infected more than 127,000 people worldwide, including nearly 81,000 in mainland China, and killed more than 5,000 people.  \n Beijing was criticized for initially attempting to censor some Chinese doctors who sounded an alarm over the virus. Since January, it has imposed draconian containment measures, effectively locking down Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, home to 60 million people.  \n U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has complained that the U.S. response had been hindered by what he called imperfect data from Beijing.  \n He and several other U.S. politicians have angered Beijing by referring to the \"Wuhan virus.\" In a national address on Wednesday, Trump called the outbreak a \"foreign virus\" that started in China.

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON - The World Health Organisation is considering changing the way it classifies and describes international epidemics, amid a protracted public debate over whether to call the outbreak of the new coronavirus a pandemic.  \n Officials at the Geneva-based WHO – who this week described it as a pandemic for the first time - are reviewing how the health agency communicates its risk assessment of disease outbreaks in the future, said two people familiar with the discussions. They said that included use of the term pandemic as well as PHEIC, which stands for public health emergency of international concern.  \n Among ideas that have been discussed is whether to use a more graded approach to capture different levels of severity, rather than binary terminology, the two people said. That would enable the WHO to dial up the severity of its messaging to prompt global cooperation on issues such as funding and drug development across the public health and scientific community, but without causing unnecessary public alarm.  \n WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has publicly signalled support for a more nuanced approach, saying the current system of declaring a public health emergency is too blunt.  \n \"It's either red or green,\" Tedros said during a Jan. 29 conference with news media. \"I think we have to now revise that. You cannot have just yes or no. There could be some intermediate situation.\" He suggested a yellow stage that could be “a warning…serious enough but not really red.”  \n The agency’s emergency committee on the new coronavirus, which is made up of independent experts, alluded to the internal discussions the following day. In a Jan. 30 statement following a meeting at which it declared a public health emergency, the panel said it recommended that the WHO “continue to explore the advisability of creating an intermediate level of alert” between PHEIC or no PHEIC.  \n WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said that currently the decision on declaring a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, is “binary.” She said the WHO’s emergency committee on coronavirus suggested, and the director general agreed, to meet to “review whether the existing instrument is still fit for purpose.”  \n The discussion around the agency’s messaging on epidemics comes as it seeks to coordinate the global fight against an outbreak of infection with the newly identified coronavirus, which emerged in December. Now known as COVID-19, it has spread from China to more than 100 countries, killing thousands of people with more expected to die.  \n While many public health experts say the WHO’s response to this epidemic has been timely and decisive, the agency has also drawn criticism from some commentators who say it has been too quick to heap praise on China – a criticism Tedros has strongly rejected, saying China’s drastic measures have slowed the virus spread and allowed other countries to prepare. The agency also came under intense media scrutiny in recent weeks as it refrained from calling the infectious disease’s spread a pandemic, even as it took grip in scores of countries around the world.  \n When the WHO did on Wednesday describe COVID-19 as a pandemic, Director General Tedros said the agency was concerned about “the alarming levels of spread and severity” of coronavirus. While the characterisation doesn’t trigger any formal change in what the agency does or it recommends countries do, some public health experts said it might prompt governments to move more swiftly to make interventions, such as banning or restricting public gatherings or travel.  \n  \n GLOBAL HEALTH EMERGENCY  \n Under the WHO’s International Health Regulations, the agency can formally declare a PHEIC (pronounced \"fake\"), or global health emergency, which it did with COVID-19 on Jan. 30. Such declarations are made when an epidemic meets two criteria: The outbreak poses a risk to more than one country and it requires a coordinated international response. The formal designation triggers various moves, including calls for increased funding and resources, recommendations to countries aimed at preventing or reducing cross-border spread of disease and boosting public health measures.  \n The WHO has declared PHEICs on five previous occasions, including the West Africa Ebola outbreak starting in 2014 and the 2016 Zika virus outbreak that spread from Brazil.  \n In 2009, the WHO declared the outbreak of H1N1 flu a pandemic. That move later drew criticism from some governments that it triggered some countries to take expensive measures, including stockpiling and prescribing anti-viral drugs and undertaking mass vaccinations against a flu that ultimately turn out to be milder than originally thought. The then-director general, Dr. Margaret Chan, has defended her decision as the “right call.”  \n How the WHO communicates around global epidemics was under review even before the COVID-19 outbreak began in December, according to the two people familiar with the discussions.  \n According to one of those people, the discussion was prompted in part by last year’s outbreak of Ebola in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which the WHO declared a PHEIC in July 2019. WHO officials wanted to sound an alarm and prompt a global response in terms of funding and vaccines, but there were questions among some officials at the WHO and member states about whether it was truly an international issue because the Ebola outbreak affected only Congo and neighbouring Uganda, the person said. They added that these questions focused discussion on whether a graded approach might be more appropriate.  \n When COVID-19 began spreading beyond China, global health officials and experts looked to the WHO to declare a PHEIC. Even after it did so in late January, the agency faced repeated questions from international media on whether or not the outbreak was a pandemic.  \n  \n PANDEMIC CONTROL  \n Some WHO chiefs have expressed concern that using the label pandemic might signal to governments and the public that the coronavirus outbreak had developed to a level where there was no longer action they could take to control its spread.  \n That was a key part of the WHO’s message when it did ultimately call the coronavirus as a pandemic. “We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic. This is the first pandemic that can be controlled,” Tedros said in a tweet Wednesday.  \n WHO officials and some global health experts said the media’s focus on the word pandemic was an unwanted distraction for them because, unlike the PHEIC classification, it doesn’t trigger specific responses within countries.  \n \"There is an unhelpful alignment in people's minds between this 'pandemic' word and some sort of major shift in approach - but this is not the case,\" Mike Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies programme, told reporters at a March 3 briefing for news media.  \n A sign of the WHO’s frustration was visible during a news conference this week – one of around 30 hour-long briefings the WHO has held for international media since the COVID-19 outbreak began. A senior official who had been asked repeatedly by journalists about whether the disease constituted a pandemic gave a half-joking but tetchy response: \"This is a word you love, right? You just can't wait, can you?\"  \n Some specialists agree that the external focus on the label pandemic have been a distraction, including Lawrence Gostin, a global health expert at Georgetown University Law School in Washington. Gostin has been openly critical of the WHO in the past - in particular for what he considered to be moving too slowly to declare international emergencies over Ebola and Zika. With the COVID-19 outbreak, however, Gostin said the WHO was right to not describe it as a pandemic prematurely because the word tends to generate fear.  \n Global health specialists say that more subtleties in how WHO messages around epidemics could be useful, but say they doubt it will make much practical difference.  \n \"In the end if you move from a binary to a three or four stage process, you'll always have these semantic arguments,\" said Jeremy Farrar, an expert in infectious disease epidemics and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity. \"And is there really a difference between a global epidemic and a pandemic? And does it make a difference to what we do?” he said. “I don't think so.\" REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "伦敦-世界卫生组织（who）正考虑改变其对国际流行病的分类和描述方式，因为公众对是否将新冠状病毒的爆发称为大流行的争论旷日持久。\n两位知情人士说，总部位于日内瓦的世卫组织（世卫组织本周首次将其描述为流行病）官员正在审查卫生机构如何传达其对未来疾病爆发风险的评估。他们说，这包括使用“大流行”和“PHEIC”一词，后者代表国际关注的公共卫生紧急情况。\n两位知情人士说，已经讨论过的观点包括，是否使用更分级的方法来捕捉不同程度的严重程度，而不是使用二元术语。这将使世卫组织能够提高其信息传递的严重性，以促进在公共卫生和科学界的资金和药物开发等问题上的全球合作，但不会引起不必要的公众恐慌。\n世卫组织总干事特德罗·阿德南姆·盖布雷耶苏斯（Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus）公开表示支持一种更加微妙的做法，他说，目前宣布公共卫生紧急情况的制度过于生硬。\n泰德罗斯在1月29日与新闻媒体的一次会议上说：“不是红色就是绿色。”我想我们现在得修改一下。你不可能只有“是”或“不是”。可能会有一些中间的情况。”他建议黄色舞台可以是“一个警告……足够严重，但不是真正的红色。”\n该机构由独立专家组成的新冠状病毒紧急委员会第二天提到了内部的讨论。在1月30日一次宣布公共卫生紧急情况的会议后发表的声明中，专家组建议世卫组织“继续探讨是否有必要在PHEIC与非PHEIC之间建立一个中等级别的警戒.\n世卫组织发言人Margaret Harris说，目前宣布国际关注的公共卫生紧急事件（PHEIC）的决定是“二元的”。她说，世卫组织冠状病毒紧急委员会建议，总干事同意，召开会议“审查现有文书是否仍适用”\n围绕该机构关于流行病信息的讨论，正值该机构寻求协调全球抗击去年12月出现的新发现冠状病毒感染爆发的斗争之际。它现在被称为COVID-19，已经从中国传播到100多个国家，造成数千人死亡，预计死亡人数还会更多。\n尽管许多公共卫生专家表示，世卫组织对这一流行病的反应是及时和果断的，但该机构也受到一些评论员的批评，他们说，世卫组织对中国的赞扬太快了——泰德罗斯强烈反对这种批评，他说，中国采取的严厉措施减缓了病毒的传播，并让其他国家做好了准备。该机构最近几周也受到了媒体的密切关注，因为它没有将这种传染病的传播称为一种流行病，尽管它控制了全球几十个国家。\n当世卫组织周三将COVID-19描述为大流行时，总干事特德罗斯说，世卫组织对冠状病毒的“惊人的传播水平和严重程度”感到担忧。虽然这一特征并没有引发该机构所做的或其建议各国所做的任何正式改变，但一些公共卫生专家表示，这可能会促使各国政府更迅速地采取干预措施，例如禁止或限制公众集会或旅行。\n全球卫生紧急情况\n根据世界卫生组织的国际卫生条例，该机构可以正式宣布一个PHEIC（发音为“假”），或全球卫生紧急情况，它在1月30日对COVID-19做了这样的处. 这种声明是在一种流行病符合两个标准时作出的：疫情对不止一个国家构成危险，需要国际社会作出协调一致的反应。正式的指定引发了各种行动，包括呼吁增加资金和资源，向各国提出旨在预防或减少疾病跨境传播和促进公共卫生措施的建议。\n世卫组织此前已经五次宣布使用苯丙氨酸，包括2014年开始的西非埃博拉疫情和2016年从巴西传播的兹卡病毒疫情。\n2009年，世卫组织宣布甲型H1N1流感爆发为大流行。这一举措后来招致一些政府的批评，称其引发了一些国家采取昂贵的措施，包括储备和开抗病毒药物，以及大规模接种流感疫苗，最终结果比原先想象的要温和。时任总干事陈冯富珍博士为自己的决定辩护称，这是“正确的决定”\n据两位知情人士透露，甚至在去年12月COVID-19疫情爆发之前，世界卫生组织（WHO）围绕全球流行病的沟通方式仍在审查之中。\n据其中一人说，讨论的部分原因是去年刚果民主共和国东部爆发埃博拉疫情，世卫组织在2019年7月宣布埃博拉为嗜血杆菌。该人士说，世卫组织官员希望在资金和疫苗方面敲响警钟，并促使全球作出反应，但世卫组织和会员国的一些官员质疑，埃博拉疫情是否真的是一个国际问题，因为埃博拉疫情只影响刚果和邻国乌干达。他们补充说，这些问题集中讨论了分级方法是否更合适。\n当COVID-19开始在中国以外地区传播时，全球卫生官员和专家希望世界卫生组织宣布其为PHEI. 即使在1月下旬这样做之后，该机构仍面临着国际媒体一再提出的问题，即疫情是否是一种流行病。\n大流行控制\n世卫组织一些负责人表示担心，使用大流行的标签可能向各国政府和公众发出信号，表明冠状病毒疫情已经发展到无法采取行动控制其传播的程度。\n当世卫组织最终将冠状病毒称为大流行时，这是其信息的关键部分。“我们不能大声、清楚、经常地说：所有国家仍然可以改变这一流行病的进程。这是第一次可以控制的流行病，”泰德罗斯周三在推特上说。\n世卫组织官员和一些全球卫生专家说，媒体对大流行这个词的关注是他们不想要的分心，因为与PHEIC分类不同，它不会在各国引发具体反应。\n世卫组织卫生紧急情况方案负责人迈克·瑞安（Mike Ryan）在3月3日举行的新闻媒体吹风会上对记者说：“在人们的心目中，这种‘流行病’一词和某种方式上的重大转变之间存在着一种无助的一致性——但事实并非如此。”。\n在本周的一次新闻发布会上，可以看到世卫组织沮丧的迹象，这是自COVID-19爆发以来，世卫组织为国际媒体举行的长达30小时的简报之一。一位高级官员曾多次被记者问到这种疾病是否构成了一种流行病，他半开玩笑，但反应激烈：“这是一个你喜欢的词，对吧？你就是等不及了，是吗？”\n一些专家一致认为，外界对大流行病的关注分散了人们的注意力，包括华盛顿乔治敦大学法学院（Georgetown University Law School）的全球健康专家劳伦斯•戈斯汀（Lawrence Gostin. 戈斯丁过去一直公开批评世卫组织，特别是他认为在埃博拉和兹卡事件上宣布国际紧急情况的行动太慢。然而，随着COVID-19的爆发，Gostin说世卫组织没有过早地将其描述为流行病是正确的，因为这个词容易引起恐惧。\n全球卫生专家说，世卫组织关于流行病的信息如何更微妙可能有用，但他们说，他们怀疑这是否会产生实际的影响。\n传染病流行病专家、Wellcome Trust全球健康慈善机构负责人杰里米•法拉（Jeremy Farrar）说：“最终，如果你从一个二元过程转变为一个三、四个阶段的过程，你总会有这些语义上的争论。”全球流行病和大流行真的有区别吗？这对我们的工作有影响吗？他说。“我不这么认为。”路透",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON (United States) — The White House has ordered federal health officials to treat top-level coronavirus meetings as classified, an unusual step that has restricted information and hampered the US government’s response to the contagion, according to four Trump administration officials. \n The officials said that dozens of classified discussions about such topics as the scope of infections, quarantines and travel restrictions have been held since mid-January in a high-security meeting room at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), a key player in the fight against the coronavirus. \n Staffers without security clearances, including government experts, were excluded from the interagency meetings, which included video conference calls, the sources said. \n “We had some very critical people who did not have security clearances who could not go,” one official said. “These should not be classified meetings. It was unnecessary.” \n The sources said the US National Security Council (NSC), which advises the president on security issues, ordered the classification. \n “This came directly from the White House,” one official said. \n The White House insistence on secrecy at the nation’s premier public health organisation, which has not been previously disclosed, has put a lid on certain information — and potentially delayed the response to the crisis. Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, has killed about 30 people in the United States and infected more than 1,000 people. \n HHS oversees a broad range of health agencies, including the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which among other things is responsible for tracking cases and providing guidance nationally on the outbreaks. \n The administration officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said they could not describe the interactions in the meeting room because they were classified. \n An NSC spokesman did not respond to questions about the meetings at HHS. But he defended the administration’s transparency across federal agencies and noted that meetings of the administration's task force on the coronavirus all are unclassified. It was not immediately clear which meetings he was referring to. \n “From day one of the response to the coronavirus, NSC has insisted on the principle of radical transparency,” said the spokesman, Mr John Ullyot. He added that the administration “has cut red tape and set the global standard in protecting the American people under President Trump’s leadership.” \n A spokeswoman for HHS, Ms Katherine McKeogh, issued a statement that did not address questions about classified meetings. Using language that echoed the NSC’s, the department said it that it agreed task-force meetings should be unclassified. \n Critics have hammered the Trump administration for what they see as a delayed response to coronavirus outbreaks and a lack of transparency, including sidelining experts and providing misleading or incomplete information to the public. US state and local officials also have complained of being kept in the dark about essential federal response information. \n US Vice-President Mike Pence, the administration's point person on coronavirus, vowed on March 3 to offer “real-time information in a steady pace and be fully transparent.” The vice president, appointed by US President Donald Trump in late February, is holding regular news briefings and also has pledged to rely on expert guidance. \n Ms Katie Miller, Pence's press secretary, said on Wednesday (March 11) that since being appointed, the vice president has never requested that HHS hold meetings in the SCIF or treat information as classified. \n The meetings at HHS were held in a secure area called a \"Sensitive Compartmentalised Information Facility,\" or SCIF, according to the administration officials. \n SCIFs are usually reserved for intelligence and military operations. Ordinary cell phones and computers can't be brought into the chambers. HHS has SCIFs because theoretically it would play a major role in biowarfare or chemical attacks. \n A high-level former official who helped address public health outbreaks in the George W Bush administration said “it’s not normal to classify discussions about a response to a public health crisis.” \n Attendees at the meetings included HHS Secretary Alex Azar and his chief of staff Brian Harrison, the officials said. Mr Azar and Mr Harrison resisted the classification of the meetings, the sources said. \n HHS did not make Mr Azar or Mr Harrison available for comment. \n One of the administration officials told Reuters that when complex issues about a quarantine came up, a high-ranking HHS lawyer with expertise on the issue was not admitted because he did not have the proper security clearance. His input was delayed and offered at an unclassified meeting, the official said. \n A fifth source familiar with the meetings said HHS staffers often weren’t informed about coronavirus developments because they didn’t have adequate clearance. He said he was told that the matters were classified \"because it had to do with China\". \n The coronavirus epidemic originated in China and the administration’s main focus to prevent spread early on was to restrict travel by non-US citizens coming from China and to authorize the quarantine of people entering the United States who may have been exposed to the virus. \n One of the administration officials suggested the security clearances for meetings at HHS were imposed not to protect national security but to keep the information within a tight circle, to prevent leaks. \n “It seemed to be a tool for the White House — for the NSC — to keep participation in these meetings low,” the official said. \n Two Democratic senators, both senior members of the Intelligence Committee expressed dismay Wednesday in statements to Reuters. \n “Pandemics demand transparency and competence,\" said Mr Mark Warner of Virginia. \"Classification authority should never be abused in order to hide what the government is doing, or not doing, just to satisfy domestic political concerns.” \n Mr Ron Wyden of Oregon said: \"The executive branch needs to immediately come forward and explain whether the White House hid information from the American people as a result of bogus classification.\" REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — The recent spate of Covid-19 infections have raised questions about the effectiveness of temperature screening, but several infectious diseases experts said that it remains a useful precautionary measure, provided it is not carried out in isolation. \n Such screening is still able to detect a “significant” number of Covid-19 cases, they told TODAY, because a sizable proportion of patients develop fever, even though not all do. \n Concern about the usefulness of temperature screening grew after the discovery of a new cluster of infections linked to a dinner at a Chinese restaurant in Safra Jurong. All the attendees had cleared mandatory temperature checks and travel declarations, the club said. \n Another case of a Singaporean man who had visited a gym in Safra Punggol had also passed temperature screening but he was later found to have contracted the coronavirus. \n The Safra Jurong cluster is so far the largest in Singapore, with 39 confirmed cases on Tuesday (March 10). \n WHY IS IT STILL USEFUL? \n Some of the experts said that the incidents show the limitations of temperature screening checks at public spaces to detect Covid-19, given its incubation period of around two weeks. \n They included Professor Tikki Pangestu, a visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and former director of the research policy and cooperation department at the World Health Organization. \n He said the screening had shown that it is not particularly efficient at picking up or detecting cases, and infected persons may not have developed symptoms of illnesses but may still be shedding the virus. \n Generally, the consensus is that having such a practice across Singapore is still better than nothing, because it would help detect febrile — or feverish — visitors. \n Professor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School, explained that while temperature checks are not foolproof, they are the “most objective test” that most public spaces can administer and so, should not be discounted. \n “There is no one single thing that we can do that will 100 per cent, accurately identify all the Covid-19 cases. Fever screening is probably the most objective test because it’s something that we can measure.” \n It is not possible to measure whether someone has a cough or a sore throat due to the coronavirus, Prof Ooi said. \n Speaking to the media last week, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services at the Ministry of Health (MOH), said that there are still a significant number of Covid-19 patients who came down with fever, so temperature screening is still important to help make sense of the situation. \n WHAT IS THE WEAK LINK? \n Assoc Prof Mak said that the health authorities have recognised that detecting infections through temperature-taking is not fully accurate. \n And because such mechanisms that try to make sense of the Covid-19 outbreak at community events are always going to be limited at picking up cases, it still remains important that individuals avoid any social activity if they are not well. \n “The ‘sensemaking’ has to start with the individual,” he said. \n Health Minister Gan Kim Yong emphasised that temperature screening form part of Singapore’s collective measures to tackle Covid-19, stressing the need to look at the various initiatives as “a whole package”. \n The travel and health declarations recorded at these screening stations, for example, are valuable in helping the authorities track the movement of people and to account for non-fever symptoms such as cough, runny nose or breathlessness. \n However, the experts said that these work only if people are socially responsible and are truthful in their declarations. \n Prof Ooi said that emphasis has to be placed on this responsibility: “If everyone can have that sense of responsibility to say that they are not feeling well and will stay away from everyone else, we’ll be very effective in controlling the disease. You may not need fever screening at that time because people will just own up if they are not well and voluntarily stay away from crowded places.” \n On Tuesday, Health Minister Gan said that the Safra Jurong cluster arose as a result of social irresponsibility: One person who felt unwell had attended the private dinner and was later diagnosed with Covid-19. The person is believed to have infected 18 others. \n IS THERE A NEED TO CHANGE STRATEGY? \n Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, infectious diseases programme leader at the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said that the recent increase in infections due largely to the Safra Jurong cluster does not indicate that Singapore’s strategy has failed in its entirety. \n “However, as the case counts rise in several countries and the prospects of global containment dims, it will be timely to reconsider this strategy for one that is more sustainable while minimising the impact on the healthcare system and economy,” Dr Hsu said. \n Several other experts agreed, noting that with the coronavirus spreading rapidly worldwide, there may be a need to adjust the strategy so that people may be able live with the reality of the disease — without trivialising the potential harm to societal health. \n Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said that Singapore is tackling Covid-19 as if it is a conventional enemy, taking an aggressive stance to try and contain the disease, such as by limiting travel through border controls. \n Now, with surges in cases such as the Safra Jurong cluster popping up now and then, the Government might need to treat Covid-19 like an enemy waging “guerrilla warfare”, he said.  \n “Any spike is a concern. It could show an unrecognised transmission cluster and in a very short time, it can overwhelm the system. The virus attacks us like guerrillas, breaking through and causing infections.” \n A reworked strategy means allowing normal life to resume, with individuals knowing their responsibility in fighting this outbreak, and healthcare institutions as well as Singapore’s border controls still maintaining a high bar of vigilance, Dr Leong added. \n DO CASE DEFINITIONS NEED TO CHANGE? \n Right now, the health authorities mostly conduct tests on suspect cases. \n These people fit the case definitions of persons with pneumonia or severe respiratory infection with breathlessness, and they would have recently travelled to mainland China, Iran, northern Italy, Japan and South Korea. \n Tests are also administered on close contacts and those hospitalised with pneumonia. \n However, the experts said that for cases that do not meet this definition, there has been some success where tests came back positive as well. \n Since last week, the Government had rolled out Covid-19 swab tests at border checkpoints to examine inbound travellers who exhibit fever and other symptoms of respiratory illness but do not meet the clinical definition of a suspect case. \n At least one case, an Indonesian man who arrived at Seletar Airport on March 7, was detected to have Covid-19 through this new swab test. \n The experts are mostly against adjusting the case definitions, because, as Prof Pang said, doing so would cause confusion and complicate the statistical tracking of cases. \n There are some merits to expanding the use of tests instead: Doing so will expand Singapore’s detection capability, they added. \n Professor Gregory Gray, a infectious disease epidemiologist from Duke-NUS Medical School, said that making testing more readily available is “wise”, noting that such self-testing measures, such as those that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is providing in America, is a good strategy for gaining better cooperation from people. \n In South Korea, for example, residents can get tested for free at drive-through stations.  \n Dr Leong of Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital said that testing and screening should be provided at general practitioner clinics and the more than 900 Public Health Preparedness Clinics scattered across the island. \n IS SINGAPORE ABLE TO HANDLE MORE TESTS? \n Addressing the question of aggressive Covid-19 testing, Assoc Prof Mak of MOH said on Tuesday that Singapore has already adopted such a stance. \n Across all the labs here, more than 21,000 tests have been done since the start of the outbreak in January, which works out to around 600 to 700 tests each week. \n “We are prepared to scale them up — we have the capacity to do as much as 2,000 tests in a day,” Assoc Prof Mak said. Each test costs around S$260, he had said before. \n “We are looking also at new technologies to see whether it could allow us to improve our diagnostic capabilities and we look forward to commercially available point-of-care testing.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "新加坡-最近一系列的Covid-19感染引起了对温度筛查有效性的质疑，但是一些传染病专家说，如果不是孤立地进行，它仍然是一种有用的预防措施。\n他们今天告诉我们，这样的筛查仍然能够检测出“显著”数量的Covid-19病例，因为相当一部分患者会发烧，尽管并非所有患者都会发烧。\n在发现一个新的感染群与萨弗拉朱隆一家中餐馆的晚餐有关后，人们对温度检测的用处越来越担心。俱乐部说，所有与会者都通过了强制性的温度检查和旅行申报。\n另一例新加坡男子曾到萨弗拉邦戈（Safra Punggol）一家健身房锻炼，也通过了体温筛查，但后来发现他感染了冠状病毒。\nSafra-Jurong群是新加坡迄今最大的一个，周二（3月10日）有39例确诊病例。\n为什么它仍然有用？\n一些专家说，鉴于Covid-19的潜伏期约为两周，这些事件显示了在公共场所进行温度筛查以检测它的局限性。\n其中包括李光耀公共政策学院客座教授、世界卫生组织研究政策与合作部前主任蒂基·潘盖斯托教授。\n他说，筛查结果显示，在接诊或发现病例方面并不是特别有效，感染者可能没有出现疾病症状，但可能仍在传播病毒。\n一般来说，人们的共识是，在新加坡各地开展这样的活动仍然比什么都不做要好，因为这将有助于发现发烧或发烧的游客.\n杜克国立大学医学院新兴传染病项目副主任吴英昂教授解释说，虽然温度检查并非万无一失，但它们是大多数公共场所都能进行的“最客观的测试”，因此，不应打折扣。\n“我们没有一件事可以做到百分之百地准确识别所有Covid-19病例。发热筛查可能是最客观的测试，因为它是我们可以测量的。”\n乌伊教授说，目前还无法确定是否有人因为冠状病毒而咳嗽或喉咙痛。\n卫生部医疗服务司司长麦肯尼斯（Kenneth Mak）副教授上周在接受媒体采访时说，仍有相当数量的Covid-19患者因发烧而病倒，因此温度筛查对于帮助了解情况仍然很重要。\n薄弱环节是什么？\n麦教授说，卫生当局已经认识到，通过体温测量来检测感染并不完全准确。\n而且，由于试图在社区活动中了解Covid-19爆发的这种机制在接诊病例方面总是有限的，因此，如果个人身体不好，避免任何社会活动仍然很重要。\n他说：“这种‘感官塑造’必须从个人开始。\n卫生部长甘金永强调，温度检测是新加坡应对Covid-19的集体措施的一部分，他强调需要将各种举措视为“一个整体”。\n例如，在这些检查站记录的旅行和健康申报，对于帮助当局追踪人员的流动情况和解释咳嗽、流鼻涕或呼吸困难等非发热症状，都是很有价值的。\n然而，专家们说，只有当人们对社会负责并且在他们的声明中真实的时候，这些方法才能起作用.\n欧教授说，必须强调这一责任：“如果每个人都能有这种责任感，说自己感觉不好，会远离其他人，我们就能非常有效地控制疾病。那时你可能不需要进行发烧检查，因为如果人们身体不好，他们只会承认，并自愿远离拥挤的地方。”\n周二，卫生部长甘藏春说，萨弗拉-句容集群的出现是由于社会不负责任：一名感到不适的人参加了私人晚宴，后来被诊断为Covid-19。据信，此人感染了另外18人。\n有必要改变策略吗？\n新加坡国立大学（National University of Singapore）Saw Swee Hock公共卫生学院传染病项目负责人徐立扬（Hsu Li Yang）副教授表示，最近主要由于Safra Jurong集群导致的感染率上升，并不意味着新加坡的战略整体失败。\n徐博士说：“然而，随着一些国家的案件数量上升，全球遏制的前景暗淡，重新考虑这一战略将是及时的，因为这一战略将更具可持续性，同时将对医疗体系和经济的影响降到最低。”。\n其他几位专家也认为，随着冠状病毒在全世界迅速传播，可能需要调整战略，使人们能够面对疾病的现实，而不忽视对社会健康的潜在危害。\n伊丽莎白诺夫纳山医院传染病专家梁浩南博士说，新加坡正在像对付常规敌人一样对付Covid-19，采取侵略性姿态，试图通过限制通过边境管制的旅行等方式来遏制这种疾病。\n他说，现在，随着诸如萨弗拉-句容集群等案件的激增，政府可能需要像对待发动“游击战”的敌人一样对待科维德-19. \n“任何峰值都是一个问题。它可能会显示一个无法识别的传输集群，在很短的时间内，它可能会压倒系统。病毒像游击队一样袭击我们，突破并造成感染。”\n梁振英博士补充说，重新制定的策略意味着允许恢复正常生活，个人知道自己在抗击疫情中的责任，医疗机构以及新加坡边境管制部门仍保持高度警惕。\n案例定义需要更改吗？\n目前，卫生部门主要对疑似病例进行检测。\n这些人符合肺炎或呼吸困难的严重呼吸道感染患者的病例定义，而且他们最近会前往中国大陆、伊朗、意大利北部、日本和韩国。\n对密切接触者和那些因肺炎住院的人也进行测试。\n然而，专家们说，对于不符合这一定义的病例，也有一些成功的检测结果呈阳性。\n自上周以来，政府在边境检查站开展了Covid-19拭子检测，对出现发烧和其他呼吸道疾病症状但不符合疑似病例临床定义的入境旅客进行检查。\n至少有一个病例，一名印度尼西亚男子3月7日抵达塞莱塔机场，通过这次新的拭子测试被检测出有Covid-19。\n专家们大多反对调整案件定义，因为正如彭日成教授所说，这样做会造成混乱，并使案件的统计跟踪复杂化。\n他们补充说，扩大测试的使用有一些好处：这样做将扩大新加坡的检测能力.\n杜克国立大学医学院传染病流行病学家格雷戈里教授（Gregory Gray）说，让检测更容易获得是“明智的”，他指出，像比尔和梅琳达•盖茨基金会（Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation）在美国提供的这种自我检测措施，是获得人们更好合作的好策略。\n例如，在韩国，居民可以在直达车站免费接受检测\n伊丽莎白诺夫纳山医院的梁医生说，应该在全科诊所和分布在岛上的900多个公共卫生准备诊所进行检测和筛选。\n新加坡能应付更多的考试吗？\n卫生部助理麦教授周二在谈到攻击性Covid-19检测问题时表示，新加坡已经采取了这样的立场。\n在这里的所有实验室中，自1月份疫情爆发以来，已经进行了21000多次检测，每周约600到700次。\n麦教授说：“我们准备扩大规模，我们有能力在一天内完成多达2000项测试。”。他以前说过，每次测试的费用大约是260新元。\n“我们也在研究新技术，看看它是否能让我们提高诊断能力，我们期待着商业化的护理点测试。（这是）快速检测，这将使新加坡把Covid-19检测推向前沿，进入初级保健，并进入社区。",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SEOUL - South Korea reported hundreds of new coronavirus cases on Wednesday as many sick people waited for hospital beds in Daegu, the city at the centre of the worst outbreak outside China.  \n The new cases bring South Korea's total to 5,621, with at least 32 deaths, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.  \n Most cases were in and around Daegu, the country's fourth-largest city, where the flu-like virus has spread rapidly through members of a fringe Christian group.  \n Health officials expect the number of new cases to be high for the near future as they complete the testing of more than 200,000 members of the sect, as well as thousands of other suspected cases from smaller clusters.  \n \"We need special measures in times of emergency,\" South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a cabinet meeting, referring to extra medical resources for hotspots and economic measures including a $9.8 billion (£7.7 billion) stimulus.  \n \"In order to overcome COVID-19 as quickly as possible and minimise the impact on the economy, it is necessary to proactively inject all available resources.\"  \n COVID-19 is the illness caused by the new coronavirus which emerged from China late last year to spread around the world.  \n Hospitals in South Korea's hardest hit areas were scrambling to accommodate the surge in new patients.  \n In Daegu, 2,300 people were waiting to be admitted to hospitals and temporary medical facilities, Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said. A 100-bed military hospital that had been handling many of the most serious cases was due to have 200 additional beds available by Thursday, he added.  \n South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Tuesday declared \"war\" on the virus, apologised for shortages of face masks and promised support for virus-hit small businesses in Asia's fourth-biggest economy.  \n  \n TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS  \n Moon's office on Wednesday said he had cancelled a planned trip to the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Turkey in mid-March due to the crisis.  \n At least 92 countries have imposed some form of entry restrictions on arrivals from South Korea, according to a tally by Yonhap news agency.  \n Vice Foreign Minister Cho Sei-young met the U.S. ambassador on Wednesday as part of Seoul's efforts to prevent the United States from imposing restrictions.  \n In the meeting, Cho outlined South Korea's efforts to control the outbreak and urged the United States not to take steps that would affect exchanges between the two countries, the foreign ministry said.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump said this week his administration was watching Italy, South Korea and Japan - all with severe outbreaks - and would make a decision about travel restrictions \"at the right time\".  \n \"We remain confident in the South Korean government’s robust and comprehensive response efforts to limit the spread of the virus,\" U.S. ambassador Harry Harris tweeted after meeting Cho.  \n Up to 10,000 people are being tested each day in South Korea, and daily totals have decreased slightly since a peak of 909 new cases on Saturday, the KCDC said.  \n Experts caution that the results of those tests could take some time to be processed, leading to future spikes in confirmed cases.

The new diagnostic criteria, which are only being used in Hubei, give doctors greater discretion in determining which patients are infected.\nIn addition to causing a dramatic increase in the number of deaths and cases, the inclusion of clinical diagnostics in the count seems to confirm suspicions that the actual number of cases far exceeds the official balances of recent weeks, writes the newspaper \"South China Morning Post\".\nThe new monitoring protocol coincides with the purging of top Communist Party figures in Hubei, where local authorities have become the target of public criticism of the Central Government's response to the outbreak.\nThe Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi guarantees that the effect of the virus on the economy is temporary and that the country will do everything it can to minimise the impact.

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON - The Trump administration is asking Congress for $2.5 billion to fight the fast-spreading coronavirus, including more than $1 billion for vaccines, the White House said on Monday.  \n With financial markets falling on concerns that the virus will have a significant impact on the global economy, the Trump administration is eager to show it is prepared to combat the virus despite the limited number of cases so far in the United States.  \n The virus has spread to some 29 countries and territories beyond mainland China, with outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Italy. [L3N2AO07M]  \n \"The Trump administration continues to take the spread of the COVID-19 Coronavirus Disease very seriously. Today, the administration is transmitting to Congress a $2.5 billion supplemental funding plan to accelerate vaccine development, support preparedness and response activities and to procure much needed equipment and supplies,\" said Rachel Semmel, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget.  \n The money will be used for therapeutics, vaccine development and the stockpiling of personal protective equipment such as masks, the White House said.  \n Of the $2.5 billion request, $1.5 billion represents new funding. The rest would come from funds already budgeted by Congress, such as unused money to fight the Ebola virus. The administration requires congressional approval to redirect that money to fight the coronavirus.  \n House of Representatives Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, a Democrat, said in a statement the Trump administration's funding request was \"woefully insufficient to protect Americans from the deadly coronavirus outbreak.\"  \n House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said late on Monday that the supplemental funding requested by Trump is \"undersized\" and \"completely inadequate to the scale of this emergency\".  \n \"The House will swiftly advance a strong, strategic funding package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis,\" Pelosi said in a statement.  \n The United States has not seen the virus spread through its communities the way that China and other countries have experienced, but health officials are preparing for the possibility even as Americans affected so far have been quarantined.  \n There have been 53 confirmed U.S. cases of the new coronavirus so far - 14 in people diagnosed in the United States and 39 among Americans repatriated from the outbreak's epicentre of Wuhan, China, and from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  \n  \n TRAVEL WARNING  \n U.S. health officials have warned that cases among repatriated citizens will likely increase.  \n The CDC warned Americans on Monday to avoid travel to South Korea because of the virus.  \n \"We have aggressively worked to combat the spread of this virus, tried to prevent it as best we could from coming into this country,\" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters earlier on Monday.  \n Trump has been at odds with his own White House advisers over China's coronavirus response. He has sought to downplay the impact of the virus, saying it could fade in April with warmer weather - something health experts said is unknown.  \n Trump has praised the work of Chinese President Xi Jinping, even as his advisers have questioned the reliability of the information Beijing has shared on the virus and expressed frustration over its reluctance to accept U.S. expertise in combating it.  \n The Trump administration is also grappling with where to send Americans evacuated from the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the virus after backing off plans to quarantine them in a federal facility in Alabama.  \n In a statement on Monday, HHS cited a \"rapidly evolving situation,\" but said the Alabama centre was \"not needed at this time\" and that it was looking for alternatives.

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK — The coronavirus that originated in China has spread fear and anxiety around the world. But while the novel virus has largely spared one vulnerable group — children — it appears to pose a particular threat to middle-aged and older adults, particularly men. \n This week, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention published the largest analysis of coronavirus cases to date. Although men and women have been infected in roughly equal numbers, researchers found, the death rate among men was 2.8 per cent, compared with 1.7 per cent among women. \n Men also were disproportionately affected during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreaks, which were caused by coronaviruses. More women than men were infected by Sars in Hong Kong in 2003, but the death rate among men was 50 per cent higher, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. \n Some 32 per cent of men infected with Mers, compared with 25.8 per cent of women. Young adult men also died at higher rates than female peers during the influenza epidemic of 1918. \n A number of factors may be working against men in the current epidemic, scientists say, including some that are biological, and some that are rooted in lifestyle. \n When it comes to mounting an immune response against infections, men are the weaker sex. \n “This is a pattern we’ve seen with many viral infections of the respiratory tract — men can have worse outcomes,” said Dr Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \n “We’ve seen this with other viruses. Women fight them off better,” she added. \n Women also produce stronger immune responses after vaccinations, and have enhanced memory immune responses, which protect adults from pathogens they were exposed to as children. \n “There’s something about the immune system in females that is more exuberant,” said Dr Janine Clayton, director of the Office of Research on Women’s Health at the National Institutes of Health. \n But there’s a high price, she added: Women are far more susceptible to autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, in which the immune system shifts into overdrive and attacks the body’s own organs and tissues. \n Nearly 80 per cent of those with autoimmune diseases are women, Dr Clayton noted. \n The reasons women have stronger immune responses aren’t entirely clear, and the research is still at an early stage, experts caution. \n One hypothesis is that women’s stronger immune systems confer a survival advantage to their offspring, who imbibe antibodies from mothers’ breast milk that help ward off disease while the infants’ immune systems are still developing. \n A stew of biological factors may be responsible, including the female sex hormone estrogen, which appears to play a role in immunity, and the fact that women carry two X chromosomes, which contain immune-related genes. Men, of course, carry only one. \n Experiments in which mice were exposed to the Sars coronavirus found that the males were more susceptible to infection than the females, a disparity that increased with age. \n The male mice developed Sars at lower viral exposures, had a lower immune response and were slower to clear the virus from their bodies. They suffered more lung damage, and died at higher rates, said Dr Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology at the University of Iowa who was the senior author of the study. \n When researchers blocked estrogen in the infected females or removed their ovaries, they were more likely to die, but blocking testosterone in male mice made no difference, indicating that estrogen may play a protective role. \n “It’s an exaggerated model of what happens in humans,” Dr Perlman said. “The differences between men and women are subtle — in mice, it’s not so subtle.” \n Health behaviours that differ by sex in some societies may also play a role in disparate responses to infections. \n China has the largest population of smokers in the world — 316 million people — accounting for nearly one-third of the world’s smokers and 40 per cent of tobacco consumption worldwide. But just more than 2 per cent of Chinese women smoke, compared with more than half of all men. \n Chinese men also have higher rates of Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure than women, both of which increase the risk of complications following infection with the coronavirus. Rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are almost twice as high among Chinese men as among women. \n In the United States, women are more proactive about seeking health care than men, and some small studies have found the generalisation applies to Chinese students at universities in the United States, as well. \n In unpublished studies, Chinese researchers have emphasised that patients whose diagnoses were delayed, or who had severe pneumonia when they were first diagnosed, were at greatest risk of dying. \n One study of 4,021 patients with the coronavirus emphasised the importance of early detection, particularly in older men. And men have been turning up in hospitals with more advanced disease. \n But in areas of China outside Hubei province, the epidemic’s epicentre and where the majority of those affected are concentrated, the patterns are different: The illness appears to have dramatically lower mortality rates, and men are being infected at much higher rates than women, according to the Chinese CDC analysis. \n Men may have a “false sense of security” when it comes to the coronavirus, said Dr Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunology at Yale University who studies why some viruses affect women more severely. \n Gathering and analysing data about the new virus by sex is important both for the scientists studying it and for the general public, experts said. \n Since the start of the outbreak, for example, public health officials have emphasised the importance of washing hands well and often, to prevent infection. But several studies have found that men — even health care workers — are less likely to wash their hands or to use soap than women, Dr Klein said. \n “We make these broad sweeping assumptions that men and women are the same behaviourally, in terms of comorbidities, biology and our immune system, and we just are not,” Dr Klein said.

Outside China, five deaths and 827 cases have been reported so far.  \n Nearly a third of the HIV positive people surveyed by UNAIDS said lockdowns and restrictions on movement in China meant they were at risk of running out of their HIV treatment in the coming days.  \n Of these, almost half - or 48.6% - said they did not know where to collect their next antiretroviral therapy refill from.  \n \"People living with HIV must continue to get the HIV medicines they need to keep them alive,\" UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said in a statement. \"We must ensure that everyone who needs HIV treatment gets it, no matter where they are.\"  \n UNAIDS says that according to Chinese government sources there were an estimated 1.25 million people with HIV in China at the end of 2018.  \n One HIV-positive volunteer AIDS campaigner in China told Reuters he has set up a group chat that includes more than 100 HIV patients, mostly in Hubei province - epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak - where he is helping patients to share limited stocks of medicines between them.  \n Some HIV patients are scared of letting other people know why they are desperate to get out of the cities.  \n \"(Patients are) very panicked, very panicked, and in the group chat I have to comfort them constantly,\" said the campaigner, who did not want to give his name. \"For patients, medicine is important, treatment is important. This could be as important as front-line relief supplies.\"  \n Adding to the problem of potential shortages is an emerging practice of people not infeGcted with HIV appealing to patients with the AIDS-causing virus to share their medicine as potential experimental treatment against the new coronavirus.  \n Although there is no evidence from clinical trials, China’s National Health Commission said the HIV drug lopinavir/ritonavir could be tried in COVID-19 patients.  \n That triggered a rush for drugs such as Kaletra, also known as Aluvia, which is drugmaker AbbVie's off-patent version of lopinavir/ritonavir.  \n UNAIDS said lockdowns in various cities have also meant that people with HIV who had travelled away from their home towns have not been able to return home and access HIV services, including treatment, from their usual providers.

Outside Hubei this epidemic is affecting a very, very tiny, tiny proportion of people,\" he said. \n Mr Tedros also referred to an apparent decline in new cases of the disease in recent days but said that the trend \"must be interpreted very cautiously\". \n \"Trends can change as new populations are affected. It is too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table,\" he said. \n Around five percent of cases are considered critical with possible multi-organ failure, septic shock and respiratory failure and, in some cases, death,\" he added. \n Mr Tedros said there were \"relatively few cases\" among children and more research was needed to understand why.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — With Singapore’s blood banks closely watching the screening of donors during the coronavirus outbreak, the authorities are appealing for healthy donors to give blood because stocks have dipped to low or critical levels. \n In response to TODAY’s enquiries on Friday (Feb 14), the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), which manages Singapore’s blood banks, said: “Our blood stocks are currently trending downwards. We, therefore, strongly urge donors who are healthy and eligible to step forward as our patients really need your support during this challenging period.” \n With extra precautions in place, such as stringent screening of donors before they are allowed into the blood banks, HSA said that the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus, Covid-19, while giving blood is assessed to be low. \n The Singapore Red Cross said on its website that on Friday, stocks for the A+, B+, O+ and AB+ blood types were at “critical” levels, and those for the A-, B-, O- and AB- blood types were “low”. \n When blood stocks are at the critical level, this means that donors are urgently needed and urged to donate on the same day. \n For blood types where stocks are low, donors are urged to donate within the week. \n HSA said that blood is needed every day to support the needs of patients in Singapore, and that it was important to maintain at least six days of blood stock at all times for daily transfusion needs and bleeding emergencies. \n Last year, there were 75,655 blood donors, or just 1.87 per cent of the resident population. \n NO EVIDENCE CORONAVIRUS CAN SPREAD THROUGH BLOOD \n For now, there is no evidence that Covid-19 can be transmitted through blood, HSA said. \n Even so, the authority has put in place a slew of measures to ensure the safety of the blood supply and the health of its donors. \n Since last Friday — when Singapore raised its disease outbreak response code to Orange — HSA has been screening potential donors and their companions for fever or respiratory symptoms, such as cough or runny nose, and their travels to mainland China, before they can enter the blood banks or mobile donation drives.   \n Those who are unwell, on leave of absence or have been to China in the last 14 days will be barred entry. \n Apart from beefing up the screening of donors, HSA said that staff members were monitoring their temperatures twice daily, and have been told to wear masks and see a doctor if they have fever or respiratory symptoms. \n “To further assure our donors, we have also increased the frequency of cleaning to ensure the cleanliness standards of our blood banks,” HSA added. \n INFECTED DONORS TO BE DEFERRED \n As for donors who have Covid-19 infection, their donations will be deferred until more information becomes available, HSA said. \n “They will only be allowed to donate blood when there is more medical data to indicate when it is safe for donors who have recovered from the novel coronavirus infection to donate blood again,” it added. \n Blood donors told TODAY that they would continue to give blood, although one donor is concerned about visiting the blood banks. \n Undergraduate Tan Hui Lin, 24, who last donated blood in 2018, said that the blood banks are in areas where people tend to congregate. \n HSA’s four blood banks are in Outram, Dhoby Ghaut, Woodlands and Jurong East. \n “Most of us would avoid crowded places… there’s high inertia to actually leave the house,” Ms Tan said, although she added that she would donate blood if the supply is low. \n Mr Shahroull Khairoullah, 29, a painting company owner who gives blood every three months, said that he would not do so for now because he has been coughing for the past few weeks. \n Business development manager Chan Si Yong, 27, said that HSA’s added precautions were helpful, even though screening procedures were already stringent before the virus outbreak. \n Donors have to fill in a health questionnaire and be checked by a medical screener, he said. “If you are unwell, they will turn you down.” \n Public servant Andrew Wilfred, 33, said that the coronavirus outbreak would not deter him from donating blood. \n “I trust that the nurses are doing their best to maintain the high standards of hygiene that they have always done.” \n For information on where to go for blood donation and the blood banks' opening hours, go to HSA's website or the Singapore Red Cross' website. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "HONG KONG — Medical personnel in Wuhan, outfitted in protective suits as they battle the coronavirus outbreak, wear diapers as they work through gruelling shifts, often until skin irritation from their masks leaves bloody marks on their faces, a news briefing was told on Wednesday (Feb 12). \n “When doctors and nurses are in the ward,” dressed in protective clothing that seals them off from the environment, “they cannot eat, drink or go to the bathroom”, Dr Han Ding, deputy director of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, told reporters in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. \n “Just in case they must urinate, they [wear a] diaper, and wash up after they’re done with their shift,” he said. \n Dr Han is one of hundreds of doctors brought in from beyond Wuhan to support the round-the-clock fight against the coronavirus. So far, the disease has killed more than 1,300 people worldwide, with all but two of the deaths in mainland China. Also known as novel coronavirus, or Covid-19, the illness had infected more than 60,000 globally as of Thursday. \n Leaders of medical teams described the difficult working conditions during the daily briefing held by the government of Hubei, the central China province in which Wuhan is located. \n “Wearing the protective suits is extremely uncomfortable,” said Dr Ma Xin, deputy dean of Huashan Hospital in Shanghai. “Sometimes I want to itch, but we absolutely cannot do that, so we just have to bear it. \n “Our doctors and nurses all have signs of irritation and even bloody marks on the bridges of their noses. These are the conditions of their work.” \n Dr Han said medical staff were working around the clock to care for those in the most critical condition. Nurses were putting in 4-6 hour shifts in intensive care units, while doctors were working from 6-8 hours, though shifts could go even longer, he said. \n “Doctors and nurses are wearing their equipment so long you can see the marks on their faces,” said Dr Zhou Jun, party secretary of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing. \n Dr Zhou, who serves at Tongji hospital in Wuhan, said medical staff were doing all they could to save lives, given limited supplies. \n Advanced equipment brought in from around the nation is playing a critical role in the struggle with the virus, Dr Ma said. \n “In the absence of specific medicines [for the virus], ventilators and ECMO are of great importance in the treatment,” he said. He was referring to ECMO machines, which circulate a patient’s blood through an artificial lung, giving the lungs of those in the most critical condition an opportunity to rest and recover. \n Respirators, artificial lung machines and other equipment also play a vital role in keeping the death rate from climbing higher. \n Dr Zhou said his team brought with them 15 million yuan (S$2.98 million) of cutting-edge equipment from Beijing, including not only ECMO machines but ventilators, monitors, bronchoscopes and other devices. \n “Some of this equipment is very expensive, but plays a critical role in curing patients,” Dr Zhou said. “The most important thing is to reduce the death rate, and increase the rate of those cured.” \n The World Health Organization, seeking to distinguish the virus from the disease it causes, said on Tuesday that it had named the virus SARS-CoV-2, and the disease Covid-19.

It is to Asia what Dubai is to the Middle East and Africa, or London's Heathrow to Europe. Last week, a history buff walking into any of its terminals could be excused for musing this must have been how newly deserted towns in the Sierra Nevada seemed at the end of the California Gold Rush. \n The barely active terminals are a result of the Singapore Government's decision to disallow all short-term visitors into the country as it battles Covid-19, now seeing a second surge after the island republic asked its sons and daughters overseas to come home to escape the coronavirus ravaging Europe and America. Bars and other entertainment outlets have been ordered to close; equally significant for a determinedly multicultural, multi-religious nation, mosques and churches, too. \n Singapore thrives on openness; trade, for instance, is three times its gross domestic product (GDP). That it should have taken these steps even as its annual tourist numbers are more than three times its 5.7 million resident population underscores how seriously it is taking the threat. \n READ MORE HERE \n \nST ILLUSTRATION: CEL GULAPA \n Monday two weeks ago marked a month since mobile game developer Jiang Wenqiang was stranded in Wuhan, the Chinese city in Hubei province where the coronavirus outbreak was first reported. \n To support himself, he worked 12 hours a day collecting rubbish and scrubbing floors at a local hospital. \n It was not his plan. Mr Jiang, from China's north-east city of Dalian, had been on a train from Shanghai to the southern city of Changsha in Hunan province to sign a contract with a business partner early last month. While on the train, he left his compartment to buy lunch. \n READ MORE HERE \n \nA woman's family mourning her death in Italy this month.

Younger voters made it clear they wanted \"change\" and this proved life-threatening for Mr Varadkar's minority administration which delivered unprecedented economic growth but presided over an acute housing shortage. \n READ MORE HERE \n \nFood delivery has become popular in Brazil amid the pandemic as people stay in.

If one follows the world example, 81 per cent of people infected with the virus will have mild symptoms and recover soon. \n In times of pandemic and panic, the story of a young medical student, among the first three cases to test positive in India, gives hope. \n The 23-year-old medical student studying in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the new outbreak, landed in Kerala on Jan 24, and the next day, he reported to the nearest public health centre. \"It was my responsibility,\" he tells me in a phone interview from Allepey, Kerala. \n READ MORE HERE \n \nThe coronavirus pandemic has caused panic buying in many countries, including in Canada, with supermarket shelves empty of items such as canned and packaged food, and toilet paper.

Because you're returning from the United States, you have to undergo self-isolation for two weeks, on your own floor of the house and in your own bed and bathroom, while I have to practise \"social distancing\". I don't have any symptoms beyond a slight sore throat, but it makes sense for everyone to act as if they are infected, as there aren't enough tests. Which is why I am in our 350 sq ft basement apartment, and you are in the house itself. \n I tried to leave your solitary-confinement cell pristine by disinfecting everything I have been touching regularly before I took up my lowly place in the basement: all the taps and faucets, the stairway banisters, the flush handles on the toilets, the front and back door knobs, the blind string on the window nearest the bed. \n READ MORE HERE \n \nA cashier serving a customer behind a makeshift plastic curtain as a preventive measure against the spread of the coronavirus in Toluca, Mexico, last Friday.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Various apps have been created in China, South Korea and Taiwan to exploit smartphone technologies for everything from contact tracing to enforcing quarantines that require people who have been exposed to the coronavirus to stay at home. \n In China's capital Beijing, for instance, two applets \"Beijing Cares\" and \"Beijing Health Buddy\" have been integrated into the ubiquitous WeChat app. \n Each city or municipality has its own version of the applet. \n People under quarantine are also made to input their daily temperature and health status into the app. When the isolation period is over, a \"healthy status\" page is generated, which users can flash at buildings and malls to gain entry. \n To help with contact tracing, mobile phone users can text their telcos for a list of locations they have visited. But this has had its shortcomings: Some users reported visiting hundreds of towns in a day after taking a train because phones check in with every cell tower along the way. \n Despite the cutting-edge technology deployed across the city, technology like facial recognition is ineffective on a population clad in face masks. \n The authorities have thus resorted to falling back on community workers, a network of local Communist Party cadres, to enforce quarantine and isolation policies, and to check on sick residents. \n Over in South Korea, the government has developed a \"self health check\" mobile app to keep tabs on travellers entering the country, as well as citizens returning from overseas. \n The health authorities have also developed a global positioning system (GPS) enabled mobile app to monitor people under quarantine. An alarm goes off if they leave the designated isolation zone. \n GPS data is also used in contact tracing. Investigators from the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which is managing the outbreak, will interview patients first, then verify their whereabouts by checking closed-circuit television camera footage, credit card records and mobile phone GPS data. \n The government then releases details about the patients' travel history - via text messages on the mobile phone and state-managed websites - so the public can avoid places where the virus was once active. But the government's willingness to be open and transparent has raised questions about privacy. \n There were also some private sector initiatives. The GPS-enabled Corona 100m, for example, allows users to see how close they are to places that coronavirus patients visited before testing positive. It also offers information on when the patients tested positive for the virus, as well as their nationality, gender and age. \n Another app, Coronamap, allows users to see at one glance where patients are warded on a map. It also offers information about the dates the cases were confirmed, the names of the hospitals and places that the patients visited before testing positive. \n In Taiwan, Reuters reported the use of the mobile phone's location tracking technology to create an \"electronic fence\" to ensure people who are quarantined stay in their homes. \n The system monitors phone signals to alert local police and officials if those in home quarantine move away from their address or turn off their phones. The authorities will contact or visit those who trigger an alert within 15 minutes. \n Privacy concerns have limited the use of location data in efforts to fight the coronavirus in countries such as the United States. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WUHAN (NYTIMES) - The three-year-old boy was anxiously waiting for yet another round of chemotherapy. Then the coronavirus outbreak hit, and doctors suddenly turned him away. \n The boy, Fu Haoran, who has leukemia, is one of many seriously ill people struggling to get urgent, lifesaving treatment, as China pours nearly all its resources into the Covid-19 epidemic. \n Some have not survived. Others like Haoran are in limbo, and their families fear for their future. \n In Wuhan city - the centre of the outbreak, many hospitals have been converted into facilities for treating only patients with the virus. Elsewhere, other facilities have closed amid shortages of medical workers or rejected patients because of fears of cross-infection in the wards. Elective surgeries have been postponed indefinitely. \n Many cities have imposed travel restrictions and quarantine requirements that, for many critically ill patients, mean delays they cannot afford. \n \"The country is in a state of crisis - this we understand,\" said the boy's father, Mr Fu Hetian, in Wuhan. \"But when will it end?\" \n Since the outbreak took hold in late January, it has killed nearly 3,000 people and sickened over 80,000 people in China. With the daily tally of the virus infections now on the decline, Chinese officials have begun to tout the country's efforts to combat the epidemic as a victory. \n But the outbreak is straining a health care system that was overburdened even before the virus surfaced, and many patients with other illnesses are now falling through the cracks. \n The concern is the country's containment efforts may be saving some lives at the expense of others. \n \"There are so many medical conditions out there that require timely care,\" said Dr Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security. \"You're going to have people die or they are going to get really bad outcomes if they don't get care.\" \n Assistant professor of health policy and economics Chen Xi at the Yale School of Public Health said he thought it was likely that deaths from cardiovascular and other chronic diseases that could have been prevented could outnumber the lives saved from treating Covid-19 patients. \n Many patients and their family members say they have been left to fend for themselves, so have turned to Chinese social media, posting desperate messages to find care. \n One such post on Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like microblog platform, described the dire situation that 19-year-old Tian Guanglin was in when his condition from a rare and aggressive form of muscle cancer took a turn for the worse in early January. \n Doctors in the southern city of Shenzhen recommended an immediate transfer to a better hospital in a bigger city, but no facility would take him, his mother said. \n The teenager died on Tuesday (March 3) morning. \n \"We had no way out, we had no choice, but to delay his treatment,\" said Ms Zhao Huaqing, the boy's mother. \"If he had been admitted to a better hospital, then he wouldn't be dead now.\" \n In Wuhan, one woman wrote that her 62-year-old mother who had leukemia had been turned away by several hospitals because of concerns about cross-infection. \n Blood banks in Wuhan have experienced severe shortages because of the extended lockdown, according to China Newsweek, a state-run magazine, and other news outlets. This made it next to impossible for her mother to get the weekly blood transfusions she needed to stay alive. \n \"My family has given up,\" the woman said over WeChat, a popular messaging platform, while declining to give her name. \"All we can do now is wait for her death.\" \n In an update on Weibo last week, the woman wrote that days after waiting at home for help that never came, her mother had died in a hospital emergency room. \n Assistant professor Chen said that the Chinese government could have possibly made the crisis worse in Wuhan by suddenly imposing a security cordon. \n \"The decision to lock down was hasty and did not allow for sufficient time to think about how long medical resources and resources in general may last,\" he said in an email. \n The government has acknowledged the problem. \n Last month, the Wuhan health commission said it would open six hospitals specifically for treating patients with illnesses other than the virus. \n The National Health Commission has also ordered hospitals to begin normalising operations, and some hospitals in Shanghai and Guangzhou announced that they were re-opening their outpatient clinics this week. \n But for many patients in Hubei province - where Wuhan is its provincial capital - just getting to a hospital has been a challenge. Cities there are on a strict lockdown and public transportation has been suspended. \n Since the lockdown began in late January, patients seeking treatment in Wuhan have been forced to walk for several hours. People with severe and chronic diseases have found themselves cut off from vital supplies of medicine because of the lockdown, including more than 400,000 patients in Wuhan, according to China's official Xinhua news agency. \n A survey of HIV-positive people in China conducted last month found that nearly one-third were at risk of running out of their antiretroviral treatment in the coming days because of lockdowns and restrictions on movement, according to a United Nations agency that combats Aids. \n One 27-year-old man with HIV who was visiting his family in the city of Huanggang, in Hubei, for the Chinese New Year holiday, had brought antiretroviral drugs to last him only two weeks. \n When the government abruptly imposed the lockdown, he started to panic. Finally, he found a volunteer who helped to deliver a supply of medicine from a hospital. \n \"Oh my god, it was like a welcome rain after a long drought, like coming back from death's door,\" he said in an interview. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the stigma attached to the virus. \n Some patients are finding themselves in a bureaucratic mess as they are bounced between hospitals and Covid-19 testing facilities. \n Last month, Mr Liao Jiahao, 23, went to a hospital in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou hoping to get surgery for a detached retina which, if left untreated, could result in blindness. But doctors said he could not be treated until he tested negative for Covid-19. \n The second hospital he was referred to refused to test him for the virus because he was not showing any symptoms. \n Finally, a doctor at a third hospital agreed to do the test. But days after Mr Liao submitted the results to the first hospital, he learned that his case had been dropped. Calls for help to the police and to a local government hotline went nowhere. \n It has been nearly two weeks since Mr Liao first sought help from doctors. With each passing day, his vision had become increasingly blurred, said his girlfriend Liang Wanying. \n \"We are so lost,\" Ms Liang said. \"There are just no resources left for patients who don't have the coronavirus.\" \n In recent weeks, networks of volunteers within China and abroad have emerged in response to the many non-Covid-19 patients pleading for help online. \n In self-organised groups on WeChat, the volunteers work together to gather information about patients and hospitals. Some reach out to community workers, local government offices and hospitals on behalf of patients; others serve as liaisons between families and reporters. \n \"Sometimes we can't help as much as we would like,\" said Ms Pu Yan, a writer who has been volunteering from her home in California. \"A lot of patients weren't able to get admitted to hospitals in a timely manner, so the optimal window for treatment had already passed.\" \n The sick and their relatives often speak with a tone of resignation that comes from the knowledge that their suffering is not unique - that even those with the virus have had difficulty getting treatment at hospitals. \n Stuck in Wuhan, Fu Haoran, the little boy with leukemia, could rely only on a fast-dwindling supply of oral medicine. \n Two weeks ago, the family was relieved to hear that the hospital could take him for another round of chemotherapy. \n Two days later, the family was back in their rented apartment, wondering when the next opportunity for treatment would come along. \n \"Right now, all I'm worried about is whether the cancer will come back,\" said the boy's father. \"If it does, I really don't know what I'll do.

Excluding new infections in Hubei, there were only six new cases in mainland China, the lowest since last month. That brings the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China so far to 80,026. \n The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China reached 2,912 as of the end of Sunday, up by 42 from the previous day. \n Hubei accounted for all of the 42 new deaths, while 32 people died in Wuhan. \n In line with the falling number of new infections, Wuhan closed its first makeshift hospital after it discharged the last batch of 34 recovered patients, CCTV reported. \n As of last Friday, Wuhan had created 16 temporary hospitals, adding 13,000 beds, with 12,000 people treated so far. Overall, the number of Wuhan hospital beds have risen from 5,000 to 23,000. \n Eighteen provinces across China have so far lowered their coronavirus emergency response level in the past week, the latest being Zhejiang province which cut its emergency response measures to level II from level I, according to the provincial government's official Weibo account on Monday. \n China has a four-tier response system for pubic health emergencies that determines what measures it will implement, with level I being the most serious. \n President Xi Jinping warned on Sunday however that China needs to take a long-term view of the outbreak and plug loopholes in its laws and emergency response mechanisms, as Beijing reported two new cases of Chinese nationals recently returned from Iran, where coronavirus cases have multiplied quickly. \n China's Global Times also reported on Monday one imported case from Italy in Zhejiang province, though its local health commission said there were no other domestic confirmed cases reported in the province on Sunday. \n ",

Photo: Ricardo L ó PEZ heviasin, but it's neither a \"miracle\" vaccine to treat the infection, nor a 100% national drug, although Cuba's technology for producing interfering molecules has improved the efficiency and quality of the process.\nThis is not chauvinism, but a fact that is confirmed by the international status of the centre for genetic engineering and biotechnology.\nAccording to Santiago Du ñ as Carrera, deputy general manager of Changchun Heber biological technology joint venture, the joint venture uses Cuban technology to manufacture alpha 2b interference. Based on the experience accumulated by Cuban scientists in this field, it is in the common interests of Cuba and China to develop the production and marketing of biotechnology products.\nTo that end, he pledged to transfer technology and knowledge from cigb to a new joint venture for the production of antiretroviral drugs, which was completed in 2007 and a health register was obtained.\nSince then, interventions have been used to treat diseases such as hepatitis B and C until they are included in China's health insurance, covering 20 regions across the country.no\nThe Chinese government recognizes the ability of the Cuban biotechnology industry to develop safe and effective products, but points out that at the time of the establishment of Changchun Heber, such interference had been used in different countries.\n\"At present, the drug is produced in joint ventures in four main ways, all by injection, using different doses: 30, 5, 6 and 10 million international road units, while from 2007 to the end of 2019, the dosage used exceeded 4 million, There are more than 100000 patients in this country\n\"This is the first example of how Cuban interferon arrived in China and its use in the current epidemic situation.\"\nAfter the spread of the new coronary artery, the Asian giant Health Committee asked interferon production companies, including Changchun Hebrew, to provide the drug to the health care system. \"` it is not the only drug to deal with the epidemic, but it is one of the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of covid-19, especially in the form of aerosols.\nComment more than a month ago\nTo understand how Cuba produces interferon alpha 2b, we have to look back at the 149 house of the atabe distribution company in Havana, which has only about 180 square meters of land, but still has professionalism and commitment.\nEven if we are faithful to history, we have to say, \"it is commander in chief Fidel Castro Ruz who, with his vision, understands the need for Cuba to enter the field of modern biotechnology.\".\nThat's what Gustavo furrazola g ó mez, a professional biologist and the founder of cigb, said.\nThe work began in 1981 when Fidel met with Randolph Lee Clark, an American doctor.no \"At that time, the leader of the Cuban revolution asked him about the latest cancer treatment in the world, and Lee Clark told him that he was interfering in the hospital he operated in Texas. After this meeting, two Cuban scientists went to Texas for some training. \"\nThe team will then include four other experts who will travel to Professor Kari cantell's laboratory in Helsinki, Finland, where interferon molecules were first obtained in 1972.\nFurrazola g ó mez commented that once the scientists returned to Cuba, with the support of other professionals, the \"hut\" was transformed into a laboratory, becoming a center of intense work, until 28 May 1981, when our country first produced interferences from white blood cells.\nNecessary clarification\nWhen the Cuban biotechnology industry began to produce interferon, the technology used was very similar to that used by Schering enough, a pharmaceutical company based in the United States.\n\"However, we began to develop our own characteristics and particularities in terms of the technologies used, with a view to improving the production process,\" said remeora ya í Cruz Ru í seco, current cigb import director, who has worked on the production line for 16 years.\nThe research enables us to form a recognized practice at the institution and level of production of relevant drugs. Because of this technology, we can reach the purity of 99% interferon molecule, which is a very complex problem. In addition, these plots have a special structure. High standards of efficiency and safetyno\nIn the production process of interferon α 2B, the genetic engineering center cooperates with the National Center for biological agents, especially in the second stage, the final product filling or dissolution.\nWe have been working with clinical and research departments to study the new application of this drug in patients, because although it is mainly used to treat cancer, it also has antiviral properties.\nIt is worth mentioning that this drug has been used in other epidemic situations in Cuba, such as the hemorrhagic dengue epidemic in 1981 and the 1990s, to treat viral conjunctivitis, this time in the form of E.coli.\nSo it's not surprising that, in the face of cocib-19, which works continuously to increase production, workers like Gustavo furrazola are proud to participate in the production of a drug that can help others, no matter how long they work. Moreover, as he himself said, \"at a time like this, we remember Fidel's vision, which has become another reason for compromise.\".",

In contrast, they have assembled 37000 soldiers on European territory to conduct exercises using violence and any measures recognized by the World Health Organization (who) to control the epidemic.\nIn addition to serious allegations that the virus may have been produced in laboratories and spread throughout China - nationwide radiation in Iran or Italy - there are currently 20000 US soldiers operating in several European countries, They will join 10000 U.S. military bases in Europe and 7000 from the region in large-scale exercises to \"show muscle\" Russia and China.\nThe arrival of troops participating in the \"defense of Europe 20\" exercise cast doubt on the effectiveness of global segregation and surprised that they did not cancel the exercise of transferring soldiers to the European front in such circumstances.\nIn addition, there is a media campaign with the same level of terror as in the days following the attack on the twin towers (2001). There are still serious questions for those responsible for this and for the implosion effects of such a rapid collapse of a strong steel infrastructureno\nFrom the perspective of biological warfare, the United States has repeatedly used biological warfare - not forgetting hemorrhagic dengue fever, swine fever and other diseases used against Cuba - with the support of its Israeli partners, It may be a perfect test of the Chinese giant's response to the imperial regime and how the world will act on this situation, which is characterized by \"uncontrollable\" viruses, but whose lethality is lower than that of the common pneumonia and pneumonia epidemics.\nSoon, the powerful blamed the economic ills of the pandemic, but \"the economy is terminally ill. Eric Toussaint, a political scientist and professor at the University of lieja and the University of Paris, believes that coronary arteritis further proves that coronary arteries are maintained only on the basis of sustained doping and that he is the head of the Committee for the abolition of illegal debt.\nMr. Tucson conducted a thorough analysis of all the declines in the stock markets of these big countries, especially since the last week of February 2020, the most serious week since the October 2008 crisis. \"From at least 2017 to 2018, all the factors that triggered the new financial crisis were, are and are together. When the atmosphere is full of flammable substances, sparks can cause economic explosion at any time. It's hard to see where the sparks will come from. A spark is like a detonator, but it's not the source of the crisis. We don't know whether the massive stock market decline at the end of February 2020 will \"worsen\" into a major financial crisis. But it's a real possibility, Toussaint insists.\nHe also warned that \"it is important to understand the real causes of the crisis and not be misled by the smoke in the real causes\".no\nAt the same time, what we see in Europe is only the revelation of the damage to the welfare systems of these countries, which have been damaged by casualties and high standards. One thing is for sure, it has never existed in our region, and it is always obtained.\nNo one commented on the enormous corruption that the cost of colonial wars in this century has caused in every European country. From the beginning, the United States stated to its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) partners, \"we have the necessary weapons, but you have to pay for them.\".\nHow much did Europe pay to control a war of aggression and occupation? Europe can negotiate with these countries to pay for oil and other products in euros, which is beneficial to both sides and peaceful.\nThe colonial occupation Wars (all ongoing) and other ongoing wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen have not only destroyed some countries, killed millions of people, caused humanitarian disasters, but also destroyed some places, human homes and the cradle of civilization. Such acts violate all the rights of the injured state and international law and are protected by an alarming impunity.\nThese unilateral colonial wars have brought tragedies to the European people, who are the victims of neoliberalism. In order to pay for cutting-edge weapons and state-of-the-art technology and equipment, European governments may have used nearly 290 billion euros stolen from Libya as jackals, as these weapons and equipment are stored in the European bank under the US blockade.\nIn these high crime colonial wars, the \"beneficiaries\" are the largest arms and equipment manufacturers in the United States and Israel.no\nEven American economists have warned that the strategy of these wars is depicted on a large map in the Pentagon hall, and its purpose is to destroy competitive capitalist groups, namely the European Union. It also means a \"war against the euro,\" defended by Angela Merkel, Germany's most political capitalist ruler, with a cloak and sword.\nAt the end of the humanitarian disaster caused by aggression and occupation, these wars left millions of desperate migrants, hungry people homeless, stateless and homeless. Just look at the figures of the international institutions that preceded these barbaric invasions, and you can see that in Libya or Syria, people's living standards are sometimes higher than those of ordinary European citizens.\nThousands of desperate people have fled the war, been engulfed by the sea, or become tortured beggars within the borders of terror, without the help of international institutions. What did Europe get out of all this? Who is the leader of the occupation of these countries? Who plundered oil and other territorial wealth? The virus that has paralyzed the world since the beginning of March, China's foreign ministry believes the U.S. military could have taken the coronary artery to Wuhan, the city most affected by the outbreak, where the soldiers conducted military exercises in October 2019.\n\"When did patient zero start in the United States? How many people are infected? What's the name of the hospital? It could be the US military. On March 9, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian tweeted a letter saying \"the epidemic has spread to Wuhan.\".\nOn the other hand, former CIA agent Philip giraldi told Spanish TV that his country may have made the virus as a weapon of war to harm China and Iran.no As far as Italy is concerned, some analysts point out that this is the first country in Europe to sign so many important agreements with China, which makes Washington angry.\nOn the other hand, the Iranian military also reported that various studies have shown that covid-19 may be a new strategy and form of war for the United States, an alliance against the enemy, with the purpose of \"causing death, instability and instability\".\nInternational analyst Jos é jofr é leal warns that this is not \"a new strategy and a new form of war\" as research shows that the epidemic combines \"elements of conventional, unconventional, biological and cyber warfare\".\nHe also referred to the speech of Ayatollah said Ali jamani, the leader of Iran's Islamic revolution, who ordered mobilization against biological warfare, because the outbreak of covid-19 is expected to be such an attack. Claims that the United States will use new coronary arteries as biological weapons \"First of all, the Chinese themselves admit that the US military may merge the coronary artery into China,\" the expert said of the Wuhan exercise.\nOn March 11, Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and prevention, publicly admitted that some Americans who apparently died of flu had tested positive for new coronary arteries in their final diagnosis.no\nSimilarly, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mar í a zarajova said that the U.S. allegations of coronary arteritis against Russia were \"deliberately fabricated\" and recalled the country's minister of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, In February, he told the China times that he saw the virus as an \"opportunity\" because it could help the U.S. resume employment in the trade war between Washington and Beijing.\nIn the same context, who has warned that the time to eliminate coronary aneurysms is shrinking and that they have become a pandemic - not because there are fewer deaths than seasonal pneumonia, but because of the number of affected countries. In particular, the case of events in Italy that did not have a \"clear epidemiological link\" with China was concerned.\nIn this multifaceted situation, the means of the United Nations system cover up the facts. In the face of humanitarian tragedy, they do not hesitate to manipulate information and use it as a weapon of blind war.\nIn so many shadows, from a small island in the Caribbean, namely Cuba, despite being blockaded by the world's largest power (the United States), they have used drugs to control the disease in China. The Cuban government has contact with the Cuban government and produces drugs in a large laboratory in China.\nWhile the far right and the coup government in Latin America deprived their people of the only medicine they had received in their lifetime from the Cuban doctors who had died, such as in Brazil, Bolivia and elsewhere, they condemned the neglect of their people's health, Italy requests medical assistance from the Cuban governmentno\nThese are the lights and shadows of a very fragile moment in the world. At this moment, solidarity is obviously the biggest antidote, but we are also convinced that we cannot let the war continue. We know that war means the end of mankind.",

        "news_content_translate_en": "On the afternoon of Tuesday, 17 March, the round table television programme discussed Cuba's strategy to control and prevent the expansion of covid-19, inviting the following panellists:\nDr. Francisco dur á n Garc í a, director of national epidemiology, Ministry of health and social welfare of Cuba, director of the centre for health promotion and disease prevention, Ministry of health and social welfare of Cuba, Dr. Jorge Delgado bustello Mar í a Guadalupe Guzman tirado, director of ipk research, diagnosis and reference center\nDr. Francisco dur á n Garc í a, director of national epidemiology, Ministry of public health (minsap), introduced the latest world development of SARS cov-2 coronary aneurysm, which is the cause of the risk of HIV / AIDS and infectious diseases.\nPhoto: screen capture shows that since the first case was found in Wuhan, China in December 2019, progress has been very rapid.\nHe explained that the latest figures showed that the number of countries with at least one case was 144. According to the latest data released on Tuesday, more than 180000 people were infected and more than 7000 died.\nDr. Duran Garcia stressed China's efforts to contain the virus and pointed out that more than 98000 people outside China had been infected with the virus, with a mortality rate of 4%, higher than during the most severe period in China.\nWith regard to the situation on the island, he confirmed the emergence of two new cases of covid-19 in Cuba, with seven patients diagnosed with the disease.\nHe pointed out that almost all infectious diseases have a feature that they are transmitted through contact with foreign infected persons.no\n\"We cannot talk about the presence of infectious diseases in our country, because when we start to find people with HIV, whether they have symptoms or not, they are associated with any infected people from abroad or with them. 'we are preparing for this,' he said.\nThis means that since January, Cuba has developed a plan for the prevention and control of the epidemic, and since then, a series of actions have been carried out under the leadership of the main national authorities in the country, as the disease requires cross sectoral prevention and treatment.\nThe director of the national epidemiology division of the Ministry of health added that the plan had incorporated knowledge of clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic characteristics.\nIn our country, there is no land border and good control. This advantage minimizes the risk of entering our country, because this person may be spreading disease and has not been detected at the time of entry.\nFrom the beginning, we have taken measures to isolate people with the characteristics of the disease in designated centres, enabling us to closely monitor nearly 25000 primary health care workers and anyone from countries at risk of the epidemic.\nTwo new cases of covid-19 have been reported, bringing the total number of infections in Cuba to seven.\nHe reported that today, the laboratory of the Pedro Kouri Institute of Tropical Medicine confirmed the diagnosis of Cuba's seventh case, almost all of whom came from countries of transmission, two of whom had very close ties with people abroad.\nOn the issue of quarantine, he pointed out that \"this measure is formulated in every country, because the situation of quarantine is becoming more complex, not international\".no\nIf the prescribed measures are taken and there is no evidence of the spread of the disease in a group of cases, then isolation is not justified.\nSimilarly, he explained that shutting down workplaces and educational institutions creates stress and stress, a process known to reduce the body's immune capacity and increase risk.\nAware of this, the country has taken measures in recent days to prevent population aggregation.\n4、 Why is Cuba not taking extreme measures?\nCommenting on why Cuba did not take extreme measures such as quarantine, he explained that quarantine was carried out by each country according to its characteristics. The World Health Organization has developed phased implementation measures.\nThe expert reiterated that all cases found in Cuba were not transmitted but were due to infection abroad.\n\"Segregation is determined on the basis of dissemination and there is no reason at present. 'we didn't try to get there,' he said.\nIt noted that it would also be unwise to close schools or workplaces before domestic broadcasting.\nIf there is no obvious spread and school closure, there will be additional pressure and reduced immunity. He stressed that Cuba noted and publicly announced that a highly populated group had ceased its activities. \"\nCuba and acute respiratory infections\nMar í a Guadalupe Guzm á n tirado, director of the research, diagnosis and reference centre, outlined acute respiratory infection (IRA), which experts believe is the cause of 3 to 5 million deaths worldwide. Despite the abuse of antibiotics and other secondary conditionsno\n\"` in other words, we have encountered this disease in history, most of which are viral, sometimes accompanied by inappropriate use of antibiotics, and confusion due to the similarity of symptoms such as pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, etc., he warned.\nHe said that Cuba has not evaded this reality. Anger is the main cause of death due to infection in our country, but it is also the cause of hospitalization, and in many cases it is also the cause of abuse of antibiotics, because most antibiotics are viral, although bacterial infection can also produce viruses. In addition, it has resulted in absenteeism and absenteeism.\nIn anger, he said, the virus dominates and produces a variety of symptoms, including nephritis, common cold and downhill pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and bronchitis in children. Different viruses can produce the same symptoms\nIn this regard, he stressed that the viruses we talked about include influenza A, influenza B, parasitic diseases, enteroviruses d68 and other emerging viruses and coronaviruses that shook the world in 2009.\nMonitoring of respiratory infections in the Cuban system\nThe director of ipk research, diagnosis and Reference Center pointed out that the coronary artery worm is a well-known virus population, which was identified in the 1930s as affecting many animals, such as birds, bats, rabbits, horses, mice and pigs, producing respiratory system and diarrhea, including nervous system.\nIn the 1960s, a group of coronary aneurysms were found, which affected people and became zoos. There are four basic principles, all monitored by Cuba.\nIn this global emergency, more active follow-up is under way, but national health systems monitor viral respiratory and bacterial infections on a daily basis.no\n\"Personal care can only be done by individuals,\" he said.\nDr. Guzman tirado explained that the coronary artery virus is a \"preputial soft virus RNA virus\" Because of these characteristics, people often talk about hand washing or using chlorine or alcohol as part of personal care to deal with these problems because they are easy to solve.\nPersonal care can only be done by everyone. When someone sneezes, if we touch any entrance, such as mouth, eyes or nose, we may be infected with any kind of virus. Therefore, frequent hand washing is required.\n\"However, the occurrence of coronary aneurysm in Wuhan at the end of 2019 is a new disease, which is known to be very similar to the isolated SARS in bats. Bats are a collection of different viruses.\"\nHe recalled that in 2009, mortality was high in the eastern Mediterranean, between 30 and 35 per cent, and that economic and social development in southern Africa had been strengthened. In 2012, the death rate of SARS in China was 9%, which was very serious.\nAs for the new coronary artery aneurysm virus, because it is similar to the SARS virus in bats, ipk experts believe that although there may be an unrecognized intermediate host, it is likely to come from bats.\n\"` when viewed through an electron microscope, its eyeball is similar to the crown, which is called the coronary artery.\nPhoto: screen capture technology is necessary for covid-19 detection.\nOn the other hand, Dr. Mar í a Guadalupe Guzman tirado, director of the ipk research, diagnosis and reference center, explained that acute respiratory infection was one of the causes of death among 3 to 5 million people worldwide, and Cuba was not spared.no These viruses may cause a range of different types of symptoms, so different viruses may produce the same symptoms.\nAccording to experts, this kind of coronary artery was diagnosed by the former nasofarinigeo, which is a cheap technology with a cost of up to $50. We have not only ipk, but also Villa Clara and Santiago in Cuba. \"We also have reagents, professionals, laboratories, equipment and so on,\" he said.\nWith regard to the Convention on the rights of the child, doctors stressed that the Convention has three main functions: Research on infectious diseases, specialized services and teaching. The center provides treatment for people living with HIV / AIDS in accordance with the protocol of the World Health Organization, China's experience and China's experience.\nIn terms of teaching, staff of the Cuban health system and other institutions, i.e. staff from different sectors, as well as trainers who impart knowledge in other centres, have been trained.\nIn addition, communication with scientists from other countries and the international health organization is not only for the treatment of coronary artery aneurysm, but also for the prevention and treatment of other diseases. The expert thanked the solidarity with Cuba.\nDiagnosis of new coronary artery\nThe diagnosis of this coronavirus was carried out through the former nasofarinegeo. In this case, we found the particles of the virus through the advanced molecular technology, the so-called real-time global warming potential, which was used to identify different types of viruses.\nThey are modern and expensive methods. Real time PSR testing could cost between $40 and $50, he said.no\nHe added that the technology was available at ipk in Cuba and at three laboratories at provincial health and epidemiological centres in Havana, Villa Clara and Santiago.\nPrevious photos\n4、 Strengthening community participation\n17. Pablo FeAl Canizares, head of the unit for health promotion and disease prevention, said that in Cuba, the health system has taken action to protect people. He said the plan is in line with the country's and the rest of the world's health experience.\nFamily doctor clinics and polyclinics have been organized to provide closer care, she said. The main task now is to identify vulnerable groups, such as people over 60 years of age or with respiratory diseases, those living alone and elderly homes.\nIn addition to the disinfection campaign, he argued, family doctors have intensified active investigations, prioritized the group and looked for respiratory symptoms in order to take immediate action.\nHe said the plan provided for certification of each process, explaining that more specialized training was now needed after training activities were carried out nationwide.\nAnyone can view this photo\nWith regard to the publicity plan, Pablo FeAl Ca ñ azas added that the level of public participation had increased and that the state media had provided timely and authentic information, highlighting the risks but not causing panic.\n\"The most important thing is to convey the message of trust, security and the need of the Cuban people for self-protection.\".\nAt the same time, media publicity and education materials have been produced, and interdepartmental participation has been increased. Each organization has its own missionno\nThe expert recommends that if respiratory symptoms occur, you should see a doctor as soon as possible and avoid leaving the country, and if you travel and return, you should be examined by the health authorities.\n\"Above all, Cubans have to be cautious, responsible and cautious,\" he said.\nHe reiterated that money laundering was the most effective measure to prevent the disease. As for the nasobuco people, he called on the Cubans to show their solidarity because they could make them in their own homes. \"The purpose of industrial production is to ensure that people in direct contact with infected or suspicious persons (such as doctors) wear masks.\".\n[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:WordDocument> <w:View>Normal</w:View> <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom> <w:TrackMoves/> <w:TrackFormatting/>

Colaboración Médica Cubana, precisó que la brigada médica cubana en el exterior está presente en 34 países que tienen reportes de la enfermedad.\nTodos los colaboradores cubanos han sido capacitados para enfrentarse a la enfermedad. A través de un grupo de WhatsApp se mantienen informados 24 horas y saben que tienen como premisa la protección. A la familia de estos compañeros queremos decirles que están protegidos, aseguróno\nWith regard to requests from other governments for support from Cuba, doctors explained that a decision on cooperation was being taken.\n(welcome SM Braemar's team is ready)\nWith regard to the movement of passengers on the MS Braemar cruiser, which will stop at the Cuban port on Wednesday morning, Dr. Duran Garcia pointed out that all measures had been taken at the landing site and at the airport to avoid danger to our people. He said.\nThis humanitarian action has been appreciated by many parts of the world and by others on board, who have emphasized the solidarity of the Cuban people.",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "3月17日星期二下午，圆桌会议电视节目讨论了古巴控制和防止COVID-19扩大的战略，邀请以下小组成员：\n•Francisco Durán García博士，古巴卫生和社会福利部国家流行病学主任，古巴卫生和社会福利部健康促进和疾病预防中心主任，Jorge Delgado Bustillo博士María Guadalupe Guzman Tirado，IPK研究、诊断和参考中心主任\n公共卫生部（MINSAP）国家流行病学主任Francisco Durán García博士介绍了SARS COV-2冠状动脉瘤的最新世界发展情况，该冠状动脉瘤是造成艾滋病毒/艾滋病的危险和传染性疾病的原因。\n照片：屏幕捕捉显示，自2019年12月在中国武汉市发现首例病例以来，进展非常迅速。\n他解释说，最新数字表明，至少有一个病例的国家数目为144个，根据本星期二公布的最新数据，有180 000多人感染，7 000多人死亡。\n杜兰·加西亚博士强调了中国为遏制这一病毒所作的努力，并指出，在中国境外，有98 000多人感染了这一病毒，死亡率为4%，高于中国感染最严重的时期。\n关于岛上的情况，他证实古巴出现了两个新的COVID-19病例，使七名患者被诊断患有这种疾病。\n他指出，几乎所有的传染病都有一个特点，即它们是通过与外国感染者接触传染的。否\n“我们不能谈论在我国存在传染病，因为当我们开始发现有艾滋病毒的人时，不管有没有症状，他们与来自国外的任何感染者或与他们有联系。他说，我们正在为这种情况做准备。\n这意味着，自1月份以来，古巴制定了预防和控制这一流行病的计划，自那时以来，在全国主要国家当局的领导下，开展了一系列行动，因为这一疾病需要跨部门的防治。\n卫生部国家流行病学司司长补充说，该计划已将各种临床、流行病和治疗特点的知识纳入其中。\n在我国，没有陆地边界，控制良好，这一优势最大限度地减少了进入我国的危险，因为这个人可能是在传播疾病，而且在入境时没有检测到。\n从一开始，我们就采取措施，在指定的中心隔离具有这种疾病特征的人，使我们能够密切监测近25 000名初级保健人员和来自有这种流行病危险的国家的任何人。\n据报告，有两个新的COVID-19病例，使古巴的感染者总数达到7人。\n他报告说，今天，Pedro Kouri热带医学研究所实验室证实了对古巴第七例病例的诊断，几乎所有的人都来自传播国，其中两人与国外的人有非常密切的联系。\n关于检疫问题，他指出，“这一措施是在每个国家内制定的，因为检疫的情况正在变得更加复杂，而不是国际性的”。否\n如果采取了规定的措施，并且有一组病例没有证据表明该疾病的传播，那么隔离是没有道理的。\n同样，他解释说，关闭工作场所和教育机构造成了压力和压力，这一过程已知会降低人体的免疫能力，并增加风险。\n该国意识到这一点，最近几天已经采取措施防止人口聚集。\n四、为什么古巴没有采取极端措施？\n他在评论古巴为何没有采取检疫等极端措施时解释说，检疫是由每个国家根据其特点采取的。世界卫生组织制定了分阶段实施的措施。\n该专家重申，在古巴发现的所有病例都不是通过传播，而是由于在国外感染。\n“隔离是根据传播情况确定的，目前没有理由。他说，我们努力不到那个时候。\n它指出，在国内广播之前关闭学校或工作场所也是不明智的。\n如果没有明显的传播和关闭学校，就会产生额外的压力，降低免疫能力。他强调说，古巴注意并公开宣布，一个人口高度集中的团体已经停止活动。”\n古巴和急性呼吸道感染\n研究、诊断和参考中心主任María Guadalupe Guzmán Tirado概括地提到急性呼吸道感染（IRA），专家认为，急性呼吸道感染是全世界300万至500万人死亡的原因。尽管滥用抗生素和其他次要情况也起到了作用否\n“`换言之，我们在历史上曾遇到过这种疾病，其中大多数是病毒性的，有时还伴随着不适当地使用抗生素，以及由于诸如肺炎、支气管肺炎等症状的相似性而产生的混淆，他提出警告。\n他说，古巴并没有逃避这一现实，愤怒是我国因感染而死亡的主要原因，但愤怒也是住院的原因，而且在许多情况下也是滥用抗生素的原因，因为大多数抗生素是病毒性的，尽管细菌感染也会产生病毒。此外，这也造成了旷课和缺勤。\n他说，在愤怒中，病毒占据了主要位置，产生了各种各样的症状，包括肾炎、常见感冒和下丘陵性肺炎、支气管肺炎和儿童支气管炎。不同的病毒可以产生相同的症状\n在这方面，他强调，我们谈论的病毒包括2009年震撼世界的流感A、流感B、寄生虫病、肠道病毒D68等新出现的病毒以及冠状病毒。\n监测古巴系统的呼吸道感染情况\nIPK研究、诊断和参考中心主任指出，冠状动脉虫是一个众所周知的病毒群体，在1930年代被确定为影响到许多动物，如鸟类、蝙蝠、兔子、马、老鼠和猪，产生呼吸系统和腹泻，包括神经系统。\n在1960年代，发现了一组冠状动脉瘤，它们影响到人，变成了动物园。有四个基本原则，都由古巴监测。\n在这一全球紧急情况下，目前正在采取更加积极的后续行动，但国家卫生系统每天都在监测病毒性呼吸道感染和细菌感染。否\n他说，“个人护理只能由个人来做”。\nGuzman Tirado医生解释说冠状动脉病毒是“包皮病毒软体病毒RNA病毒”由于这些特点，人们经常谈论洗手或使用氯或酒精作为个人护理的一部分来处理这些问题，因为这些问题很容易得到解决。\n个人护理只能由每个人来做。当有人打喷嚏时，如果我们碰到任何一个入口，例如嘴巴、眼睛或鼻子，我们就可能感染任何一种病毒。因此，需要经常性的洗手。\n“然而，2019年底在武汉出现的冠状动脉瘤是一种新的疾病，已知与蝙蝠体内孤立的非典有很大的相似性，蝙蝠是不同病毒的集合。”\n他回顾说，在2009年，地中海东部地区的死亡率很高，在30%至35%之间，南部非洲经济和社会发展得到加强。而在2012年，中国的非典型性肺炎死亡率为9%，表现得很严重。\n关于新的冠状动脉瘤病毒，由于它与蝙蝠的非典病毒相似，IPK专家认为，虽然可能有一个尚未被承认的中间宿主，但它很可能来自蝙蝠。\n“`当通过电子显微镜观察时，它的眼球与皇冠相似，它被称为冠状动脉。\n照片：屏幕捕捉技术是进行COVID-19检测所必需的。\n另一方面，IPK研究、诊断和参考中心主任María Guadalupe Guzman Tirado博士解释说，急性呼吸道感染是全世界300万至500万人死亡的原因之一，古巴也没有幸免。否这些病毒可能导致一系列不同类型的症状，因此不同的病毒可能产生相同的症状。\n据专家说，这种冠状动脉是通过以前的Nasofarinigeo诊断出来的，这是一种不便宜的技术，其成本高达50美元。我们在古巴不仅有IPK，而且还有Villa Clara和Santiago。他说，“我们还有试剂、专业人员、实验室、设备等”。\n关于《儿童权利公约》，医生强调，该公约有三大职能：传染病研究、专门服务和教学。该中心根据世界卫生组织的议定书、中国的经验和中国的经验，为感染者和艾滋病毒/艾滋病患者提供治疗。\n在教学方面，古巴卫生系统和其他机构的工作人员，即来自不同部门的工作人员，以及在其他中心传授知识的培训人员，已经接受了培训。\n此外，还与其他国家的科学家以及国际卫生组织进行交流，不仅是为了治疗冠状动脉瘤，而且是为了防治其他疾病。该专家感谢对古巴的声援。\n关于新冠状动脉的诊断\n对这种冠状病毒的诊断是通过以前的Nasofarinegeo进行的，在这种情况下，我们通过先进的分子技术，即所谓的实时全球升温潜能值，发现了病毒的粒子，这种技术被用来识别不同类型的病毒。\n它们是现代和昂贵的方法。他说，实时PSR测试可能需要40到50美元。否\n他补充说，这项技术可在古巴的IPK以及设在哈瓦那、Villa Clara和Santiago的省级卫生和流行病中心的三个实验室获得。\n上一组照片\n四、加强社区的参与\n17.促进健康和预防疾病股股长Pablo Feal Canizares说，在古巴，保健系统采取了保护人民的行动。他说，该计划符合该国和世界其他国家的卫生经验。\n她说，家庭医生诊所和综合诊所都已组织起来，以提供更密切的护理。目前的主要任务是查明弱势群体，如60岁以上或患有呼吸道疾病的人、独居者和老人院。\n他争辩说，除了消毒行动外，家庭医生还加强了积极的调查，优先考虑这一群体，并寻找呼吸症状，以便立即采取行动。\n他说，该计划规定对每一个进程进行认证，同时解释说，在全国范围内开展培训活动之后，现在需要进行更加专业化的培训。\n任何人都可以查看此相片\n关于宣传计划，Pablo Feal Cañazas补充说，民众的参与程度有所提高，国家媒体提供了及时、真实的信息，强调了风险，但没有造成恐慌。\n“最重要的是传达信任、安全和古巴人民需要自我保护的信息”。\n与此同时，还制作了媒体宣传教育材料，同时增加了部门间的参与。每个机构都有自己的任务否\n该专家建议，如果出现呼吸症状，应尽快向医生看病，并避免离开该国，如果旅行和返回，则由卫生当局检查。\n他说，“最重要的是，古巴人必须保持谨慎，负责任和谨慎”。\n他重申，洗钱是预防这一疾病的最有效措施。至于Nasobuco人，他呼吁古巴人给予声援，因为他们可以在自己家里制作。“工业生产的目的是确保直接接触感染者或可疑者（如医生）的人员戴面罩。”.\n[如果gte
