        "news_content_translate_en": "GENEVA (Reuters) - A World Health Organisation panel of experts on the new coronavirus met on Thursday to evaluate whether the outbreak, which has spread from China to several countries, constitutes an international emergency.\nThe 16 independent experts in disease control, virology, epidemiology and vaccine development were holding a second closed-door meeting at the U.N. agency’s headquarters in Geneva after not reaching a decision on Wednesday.\nDidier Houssin, an adviser to France’s national health security agency, is serving as chair. Chinese health authorities made a presentation by teleconference and have allowed a WHO team into the country who are due to report back to the panel.\nA news conference was expected later in the day.\nHere are some facts about WHO Emergency Committees:\n- Director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced on Monday that the WHO had called an Emergency Committee to assess the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year.\n- Declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern - known as a “PHEIC” in WHO jargon - is rare.\n- The WHO panel’s recommendations, after assessing any evidence of human-to-human transmission and other factors, would  be put to Tedros, who would decide whether to declare an emergency.\n- Only five emergencies have been declared in the past decade: the H1 virus that caused an influenza pandemic (2009), West Africa’s Ebola outbreak, polio (2014), Zika virus (2016), and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2019).\n- The WHO’s criteria, laid out in the 2005 International Health Regulations, define a PHEIC as “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response”\n.\n- Such situations are “serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected”, carry cross-border implications and may require immediate international action, its rules say.\n- A declaration would lead to boosting public health measures, funding and resources to prevent and reduce international spread.\n- It could include recommendations on trade and travel, including airport screening of passengers, although the WHO generally aims to avoid disruptive trade restrictions.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Announcement No.1 of Wuhan epidemic headquarters announced that: from 10:00 on January 23, 2020, the city's public transport, subway, ferry and long-distance passenger transport were suspended; without special reasons, citizens should not leave Wuhan. The passage for the airport and railway station to leave Wuhan is temporarily closed. The recovery time will be announced separately. The announcement said that the move was aimed at containing the spread of the new coronavirus epidemic and ensuring the safety of the people.\nAt this time, it has been more than a month since unknown pneumonia broke out in the seafood market of Wuhan. The deadly virus from the game stall in the seafood market mutated rapidly, spread among people, spread to other provinces and countries in China, and the epidemic in Wuhan seems to be out of control.\nChinese authorities said there was no evidence of \"human to human\" transmission for more than a month, until epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan went to Wuhan to investigate, and earlier this week announced on CCTV that the virus could be \"human to human\". Then the number of officially announced infections doubled in two days, to more than 500, and the number of officially recognized deaths increased from three to 17.\nAccording to some analysis, the actual number of infections may be more, because some patients are not included in the hospital statistics. For example, the field survey of Sanlian weekly quoted a nurse as saying that many hospitals do not accept pneumonia patients in the seafood market. Huang Chang, a dishonest seafood market owner, said his discharge did not indicate the new coronavirus pneumonia.\nThe day before Wuhan authorities announced the decision, a Chinese netizen revealed that academician Zhong Nanshan believed that the outbreak would be more dangerous than SARS in 2003 The high incidence period is expected to be from the end of February to the end of March. He suggested that Wuhan should be closed down and was rejected by the leaders concerned. As a result, he decided not to take any more media interviews.\nWuhan's anxiety is gradually rising. St é phane Lagarde, a special reporter of RFI from France and Guangzhou, today reported from Wuhan that Hankou, a coffee bar, a shop and a hotel at the intersection of the Han River and the Yangtze River are empty. South China's seafood market has been blocked and monitored after the outbreak of the virus, and other agricultural markets have been closed since this week. A young man said, \"yes, of course I'm afraid, because as soon as you get hot, then you can't breathe.\".\nIn a skating rink in a business center, there is only one little girl playing. Cheerwin, a young woman at the reception counter, said the situation in Hankou was more serious these days. Parents stopped taking their children out of the house, fearing that their children might catch the virus\n。 At present, she is not afraid. She thinks that if children can come to the skating rink, they are healthy, so there is no need to worry.\n",

MOH said it has contacted the authorities of their destination country. \n However, there was no evidence that the virus had spread to anyone here, the ministry said. \n After widening the net to include screening of temperatures of all air travellers from China, the number of suspected cases in Singapore has increased. \n The ministry said that in total, it has had 28 suspected cases aged one to 78 years. Seven people have been cleared. \n \"All measures will be taken to contain its possible spread,\" said the ministry's director of communicable diseases, Associate Professor Vernon Lee. \n More cases are expected, he added, given the large number of cases in China and high travel volume from the country to Singapore. \n As for the first case here, he had already been isolated and was no longer a risk to the public, he stressed. \n \"There's no need for general public to panic or do any special measures.\" \n Close contacts of confirmed cases will be quarantined. \n On Thursday, as part of measures to shore up defences against the virus, the newly-formed multi-ministry task force met for the first time, and decided to enhance border control and intensify border screening\n. \n This will be expanded to land and sea checkpoints by Friday morning. \n The virus, now known as 2019-nCoV, can now be passed from person to person, has already killed 17 people and infected at least 540 throughout China, with cases also surfacing in Taiwan, Japan, Macau, Thailand, Vietnam and the United States. \n Guests seen wearing masks at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa on Jan 23, 2020. ST PHOTO: TIMOTHY DAVID \n The Chinese health authorities have so far been unable to determine the origin of the virus but they say the new virus, which has no vaccine, is mutating and spreading. \n Infections are expected to spike over the Chinese New Year weekend as a large number of travellers travel to and from, as well as within, China. \n MOH on Thursday night also expanded its travel advisory, saying that Singaporeans should avoid travel to the whole of Hubei Province, in the light of the travel restrictions that China has imposed on the Hubei cities of Huanggang and Ezhou. \n Earlier in the day, the ministry urged people to avoid travelling to Wuhan only. Wuhan is also in Hubei province. \n The ministry also advised Singaporeans to continue to exercise caution and pay attention to personal hygiene when travelling to the rest of China. \n MOH has said that all travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. They should also inform their doctors of their travel history. \n The ministry has also advised people not to travel to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. \n It has asked travellers to avoid contact with live animals and the consumption of raw or undercooked meats, and to observe good personal hygiene. \n Temperature screening at Changi Airport was expanded to cover all inbound travellers on flights arriving from China since Wednesday. \n - Additional reporting by Aw Cheng Wei\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Wuhan Huanggang and other cities are now closed to plague (version 2.0)\nThe latest number of infections reported by Chinese state media is 634, and the death toll is still 17, which has not continued to rise compared with the previous day. However, the news about the actual number of people infected with pneumonia in Wuhan is much more than that reported by the official. It is even reported that the actual number of people infected in Wuhan is tens of thousands. Fever clinics in major hospitals are full of people, and many doctors who are infected cannot be confirmed.\nIn the face of the almost out of control epidemic, Wuhan officials also took extreme measures after being criticized for the disastrous information transparency, and announced the ban on \"closing the city\" to 11 million residents. Since 10:00 a.m. on Thursday, the city's buses, subways, ferries and long-distance passenger transport have been completely stopped, and the citizens are not allowed to leave Wuhan without special reasons. The airport, railway station and other pipelines to leave China are temporarily suspended Closed, recovery time to be announced separately. It reappears the terrible scene described in the famous French writer Camus' plague.\nThis time, Wuhan pneumonia not only revealed that the Chinese did not learn from the SARS epidemic in 2003, but also continued to hunt and kill the wild animals that were carrying the deadly virus and were forbidden to be sold. At the same time, it also showed to the world the institutional defects that the relevant departments of China still had no improvement in the information transparency and emergency response measures for epidemic diseases.\nAccording to the latest report, Huanggang City, Ezhou City and Chibi City have all taken the same measures after the closure of Wuhan, reflecting the severity of the coronavirus epidemic.\nXi Jinping's supreme directive is late.\nIt has been reported that the initial outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan was on December 8. However, since December 31, a document \"emergency notice on reporting the treatment of pneumonia of unknown causes\" was circulated on the Internet by Wuhan health institutions on the first day. After disclosure, the authorities finally came forward to confirm and began to report the cases to the society, which means that they are trying to find out what kind of pneumonia it is.\nHowever, the delay in time and the opacity of information have led to the weak awareness of vigilance and prevention of the public and medical institutions. In a short time, the invisible virus has quietly gone through the process of animal to animal transmission, and then evolved into human to human transmission. With the people leaving Wuhan, it has spread to the whole country and other parts of the world.\nChinese President Xi Jinping issued the highest directive in January on 19, calling for \"maintaining overall social stability\". We need to do a good job in epidemic prevention to prevent the spread of the epidemic. Outside analysis thinks, Xi Jinping's speech is to the new coronavirus spread situation serious confirmation.\n。 After the instruction was issued, the official disease information and statistics were released one by one, and the Wuhan government immediately made a ban on \"closing the city\". However, all this happened more than a month after the first case.\nHeavy consumption impact on the economy\nAccording to Agence France-Presse analysis, the Chinese Communist Party's regime has just been criticized for 7 years of protests in Hongkong, the criticism and condemnation of the international community's policies towards Xinjiang's ethnic minorities, and the exhaustion of China's trade war. The black swan flying out of Wuhan at the end of the new year is undoubtedly a new test for Xi Jinping.\nApart from such a major medical challenge as the threat to human life, can China's economy still be hurt? China's export, one of the pillars of the economy, has been damaged by Trump's high tax on total products. Facing the lowest economic growth rate in thirty years in 2018, Beijing hopes to stimulate economic development with domestic consumption. However, the emergence of the new virus is likely to hit the heart of China's economic growth, and tourism is the first to bear the brunt.\nBut AFP also pointed out that the SARS storm, which killed 774 people in the world in 2002-2003, caused a short-term slowdown in China's economic growth and limited impact. In 2003, thanks to the great profits brought by the export recovery, the economic growth achieved a brilliant result of 10%. But 17 years later, China has turned from the world factory to the second largest economy in the world. The regime led by Xi Jinping not only shows its strong strength to the whole world, but also shows the wild heart of the economic power that shows the responsible person in the face of the unpredictable Trump regime. But because of this, the current situation of China's economy is facing greater challenges. Will it be able to get through the difficulties as well as the SARS storm?\nCan the government continue to play the role of \"savior\"?\nAgence France-Presse reported that although it was late, but after Xi Jinping's highest directive was issued, China's health and propaganda departments immediately mobilized and took measures to let the government play the role of \"rescuers\" in the world and a country in charge of controlling the situation in the world. And if Xi Jinping's intervention can be controlled in the short term after decisive intervention, his credibility will increase correspondingly.\nAccording to the official website of the Ministry of foreign affairs of China, Xi Jinping and Merkel and Ma Long on the 22 day, respectively, on the phone, the two leaders expressed concern about the epidemic of pneumonia in Wuhan.\n。\nReported that Merkel responded to the Chinese timely response to the new coronavirus infection pneumonia, kept open and transparent, and actively carried out international cooperation to be commended. France and Germany both expressed their willingness to strengthen health cooperation with China.\nIronically, on the occasion of the campaign of dealing with the new coronavirus in the whole world and even the whole world, the front page of the official media \"people's Daily\" in January 23rd highlighted the reports of the central leaders visiting the old comrades, as well as Xi Jinping's telephone conversation with the leaders of France and Germany. The atmosphere was peaceful. On the other hand, the New York Times put Wuhan pneumonia report in the center of the front page. It is clear at a glance which is more important or less important.\nSome netizens said angrily: let's remember this humiliating day.\n",

More than 46 million people are blocked by the quarantine. Many transport, suspended. Classes at schools, canceled until further notice. Shops, closed. Coronavirus Wuhan, which has already killed 170 people and infected more than 7,800, threatens to leave, at the least in the short term, profound effects on the economy of the country, already facing its lowest growth in decades, 6.1 %.\nAs he pointed economist Zhang Ming, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences -the main think tank state Sino, speaking collecting magazine Caijing, the growth of GDP in the first quarter of this year could be reduced by one percentage point stand at 5% or less, because the break because of the virus.\nThese days, Chinese cities seem huge deserts. Cinemas, museums, and tourist attractions have canceled their operations. Most shops remain closed; which they have opened well covered dependents, with a mascarilla-, just recorded activity except selling groceries. Many restaurants have not bothered to reopen despite that, under normal conditions, these would be days to cash: now avoid crowded public places. In the industrial core of Suzhou, the factories are prohibited reopen until 8 February. Shanghai, companies do not resume their activity at the least until 9.\nWith consumption, the sector most affected by containment measures has been transportation. A blocking much of Hubei province Wuhan is located -the focus of infection-, the recommendation adds to prevent displacement as far as possible. Airports, which should be their busiest time of the year, are half-empty. They have stalled bus routes long-distance and high-speed train. Travel abroad with tour operators have been suspended. According to official data from the government, transport has fallen over the Lunar New Year dates from 2019 by 28.8%. In the railway sector, the decline reached 41.5%. In air, 41.6%.\nThe situation could not come at a worse time. Chinese New Year is like Christmas or Black Friday in the West, the moment of greatest consumer spending, a sector of increasing weight in the Chinese GDP. Weak demand and the shocks caused by trade war between the US and China had left the economic growth at 6.1%, its lowest level in three decades you.\n\"The impact of the coronavirus in the Chinese economy can be much more important than it had SARS,\" says Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia economist for the investment bank Natixis. Garcia-Herrero refers to the syndrome, also caused by a coronavirus in the same family as Wuhan, emerged in 2003 in a market in Guangzhou (South China) to leave nearly 800 deaths worldwide.\nSo that epidemic subtracted one percentage point to China's growth during the second quarter of the year, which stood at 9.1%. Sales to the retail fell by half. Although the blow to the economy was only temporary, and growth in subsequent quarters regained their previous levels above 10%.\nBut now, says Garcia-Herrero, \"China depends much more on consumption which depended in 2003, and consumption will slow without any doubt.\" A luxury goods and durable is necessary to add the hospitality industry. \"There are many sectors that will be affected, and they are much more important for Chinese growth than they were in 2003 when external demand was the key,\" he says.\n\"In China in 2019, consumption contributed about 3.5 percentage points to the total real growth of 6.1% of GDP. A quick calculation suggests that if spending on these services fell by 10%, total GDP growth would fall by about 1.2 percentage points, \"said S & P consulting firm Global Ratings in a note.\nEarly indications are not encouraging. In its reopening after the holidays, shares in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange have fallen by 2.4%. Due to the closure of major chains and the suspension of big premieres, New Year, when they usually break box office records, revenue in theaters was only 1.81 million yuan, or about 250,000 euros, according to the company ticketing Maoyan. Is a drop of 99% over the previous year.\n\"It is a certainty that the outbreak of coronavirus have an impact on economic growth this quarter,\" notes Mark Williams of Capital Economics in a note. Compared with SARS, \"while the official response this time more transparent and active it can be proved most effective in containing the virus also can make greater initial economic damage\".\nMuch of this damage could correspond to the broad sector of the Chinese underground economy, represented by migrants to urban areas. Back in the field to spend the holidays with their families, many have been surprised by quarantine or have been altered your travel plans. Prolonged break from their jobs may leave them with no income while it lasts.\n\"After SARS, China adopted an expansionary fiscal policy, including tax cuts, to help the recovery of the sectors most affected,\" said Tianlei Huang, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE). \"This time, China has large fiscal deficits and therefore has less space to implement fiscal stimulus then. In monetary policy, the central bank may increase liquidity support, but there will be credit-driven stimulus. \"\nThe key point to analysts, will be in the speed with which the crisis is resolved. \"Depending on how the crisis is reduced, and especially how they manage the Chinese government-not in small measure how transparent sea-, the cost could exacerbate the decline in Chinese growth,\" said Huang.",

Why so coronavirus grabbing attention?\nReply. Until 2002, when SARS emerged, only we knew four affecting humans. They are those that cause the common cold. The rest was just sick animals. But in 2002 the SARS emerged and in 2012 the MERS, which have caused more than 1,500 deaths.\nQ. And how is this possible?\nA. coronavirus are RNA viruses that change every time genetically replicated. We talk about trillions of variations of a virus. Sometimes two viruses are mixed. Further, the change occurs at the replicate a single virus, errors in copying. The resulting viruses can jump from one species to another. With SARS we saw that passed from bats to civets and the MERS the intermediate species was the camel.\nQ. And in Wuhan?\nR. A communication [on Friday] indicates that it is a recombination of a virus circulating in bats and another unknown.\nQ. Did not they say they were snakes focus?\nR. That they said, but there has been no one who has caught a snake and it has found the virus. They are theoretical hypotheses that have not been endorsed. The transmitting species is still a matter of debate.\nQ. How can one of these changes make a harmless virus to humans in a dangerous one?\nA. The key is to pass the virus to be recognized by human cells. They need to enter them to replicate. It may take many viruses in front of a cell, but if your recipients do not recognize them, nothing happens. Until there is one that fits and receivers let in him. When there are trillions of replications, this can happen.\nQ. What impact on public health may be capable of mutation of RNA viruses?\nR. There are two general rules in these cases. The first says that when a virus jumps species, not just be well-suited. This causes an accelerating effect of the mutations until optimize growth and multiplication, from which a slowdown occurs occurs. This, a priori, would increase the danger of the virus. But there is another general rule is that when the virus reaches a new species, are more virulent at the start and eventually will dim. This is because if they kill the person who acts as host can not be transmitted anymore. Instead, if they get sick but not much, that person will continue with their lives and expand the virus. Virulent least eventually prevails.\nQ. Why is there no vaccine?\nR. He could have, but it is not a simple process. Our laboratory and others have designed vaccines for SARS or MERS. Ours was the first in the world in 2000 succeeded in establishing a system of genetic engineering that synthesizes these new viruses in the laboratory to eliminate or modify their genes, in this case remove the so-called virulence. They kill viruses because these genes inhibit the immune response of the person. A removing these genes, attenuate and an attenuated virus is a vaccine candidate. Viruses that we have dimmed for SARS and MERS have demonstrated both in our laboratory and in the US that provide 100% immunity in experimental mouse models.\nQ. And why not have developed?\nR. regulatory agencies in Europe and the United States imposes very strict criteria, which take several years to show that these attenuated viruses are harmless and safe. But in case of serious epidemics these periods are shortened if immediate action is required. If the current outbreak worsens, the vaccine could be approved very quickly.\nQ. But have attenuated virus Wuhan? If neither 20 days ago is known ...\nR. We have designed as synthesize in our laboratory. We accumulated technology and experience. In our field, it is fast being fundamental and got to work immediately. We are already working with the US Centers for development.",

But this was mostly a product of selling pressure that had built up over the holiday and not a reflection of new market fears, analysts said.\nIn a sign of a slightly more positive tone in world markets, European shares rallied and the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc weakened.\nYields on benchmark 10-year government bonds were a touch higher across the currency bloc, but remained within sight of the lows hit on Friday - reflecting a generally cautious tone among investors.\nGermany’s 10-year Bund yield was just one basis point higher on the day at -0.44%, hovering near more than three-month lows hit at the end of last week.\nYields on German 30-year government bond yields are at 0.07% and less than 10 bps away from negative yield territory.\n“Chinese authorities have shown they have the strength and will to protect their markets and that has probably fed through to a stabilisation, but ultimately this (coronavirus) remains a complete unknown quantity and nobody knows how long it will go on for and what the impact will be on a human and economic scale,” said Rabobank rates strategist Matt Cairns.\n“That will continue to push down safe-haven yields until we know that it’s under control\n.”\nChina’s central bank unexpectedly lowered the interest rates on reverse repurchase agreements by 10 bps on Monday, as authorities stepped up measures to relieve pressure on the economy from the rapidly spreading virus outbreak.\nEuropean Central Bank vice president Luis de Guindos said the ECB sees early signs of stabilisation in the global economy but cautioned that the coronavirus outbreak is creating uncertainty.\nInvestors have started to ratchet up expectations for an ECB rate cut by year-end, with markets pricing in more than a 60% chance of a 10 bps cut by year-end.\n“Over the coming days, investors are likely to upgrade their estimates of the expected economic fallout related to 2019-nCov (coronavirus),” analysts at UniCredit said in a note.\n“As long as the increase in the number of cases does not flatten perceptibly, market sentiment will most probably remain under pressure.”\nRenewed uncertainty over Britain’s future relations with the European Union also limited the rise in euro zone bond yields.\nThe European Union and Britain clashed over a post-Brexit trade deal on Monday. The two sides set out very different visions of a future relationship that could result in the most distant of ties.\n",

It said the research had found pangolins - the world’s only scaly mammals - to be “the most likely intermediate host.”\nBut James Wood, head of the veterinary medicine department at Britain’s University of Cambridge, said the research was far from robust.\n“The evidence for the potential involvement of pangolins in the outbreak has not been published, other than by a university press release. This is not scientific evidence,” he said.\n“Simply reporting detection of viral RNA with sequence similarity of more than 99% is not sufficient. Could these results have been caused by contamination from a highly infected environment?”\nPangolins are one of Asia’s most trafficked mammals, despite laws banning the trade, because their meat is considered a delicacy in countries such as China and their scales are used in traditional medicine.\nThe outbreak of disease caused by the new coronavirus, which has killed 636 people in mainland China, is believed to have started in a market in the city of Wuhan that also sold live wild animals.\nVirus experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species\n.\nJonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Britain’s University of Nottingham, said that while the South China Agricultural University research was an interesting development, it was still unclear “whether or not the endangered pangolin really is the reservoir”.\n“We would need to see all of the genetic data to get a feel for how related the human and pangolin viruses are, and also gain an understanding of how prevalent this virus is in pangolins and whether or not these were being sold in the Wuhan wet markets,” he said.\nDirk Pfeiffer, a professor of veterinary medicine at Hong Kong’s City University, also said the research was a long way from establishing a link between pangolins and the new coronavirus outbreak in humans.\n“You can only draw more definitive conclusions if you compare prevalence (of the coronavirus) between different species based on representative samples, which these almost certainly are not,” he said.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Reuters) - Another group of nearly 350 Americans airlifted from the epicenter of China’s fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak were placed under quarantine at two military bases in California on Wednesday, as the number of confirmed U.S. cases of the disease rose to 12.\nThe travelers aboard two State Department-chartered cargo jets were met by personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for screening, and are to remain under mandatory quarantine for 14 days, the incubation period of the virus.\nFive of the passengers arrived exhibiting possible symptoms, two of them children, and were immediately hospitalized, along with the mother of one of the youngsters, the CDC said.\nThe latest evacuees, together with 195 Americans flown out of Wuhan, China, a week ago by the U.S. government, bring to 540 the number people subject so far to the CDC’s first public health quarantine in 50 years. Wuhan, in China’s Hubei province, is the epicenter of the disease.\nThe two planes in Wednesday’s airlift arrived at Travis Air Force Base in northern California, where 178 passengers from one plane disembarked to begin two weeks of round-the-clock health screening while barred from contact with the general public.\nNone of the group showed signs of disease, except for a small child who developed a fever during the flight and was taken to a nearby hospital with its mother for further testing and medical treatment in isolation, officials said. The other evacuees at Travis will be housed in a hotel on base.\nAfter refueling, the second evacuation plane flew on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, near San Diego, arriving with 167 passenger. Of that group, three adults and a child “were determined to have a fever or a cough that warranted them being transported to a local hospital for further evaluation,” the CDC said\n. The rest were placed under quarantine at two housing sites on base.\n“Because these individuals were in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, where there is intense and escalating community-wide spread of this novel coronavirus, we consider them at high risk of exposure,” said Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.\n“We are in a critical time period in the international spread of the virus, and this action is necessary to try to prevent the spread here,” Braden told reporters during a briefing at Miramar.\nHe stressed that the CDC’s strategy of early detection and containment of individuals who are sick or at high risk of exposure has been successful in preventing widespread transmission in the United States so far.\n“If there were ongoing community spread of this virus we would know it, and that’s not happening,” Braden said. “So right now, in the United States, communities across this country are at very low risk of being exposed to this virus, including in San Diego and including on this base.”\nThe United States and other countries have stepped up efforts to evacuate their citizens from China, where the coronavirus outbreak has killed more than 500 people, most in and around Wuhan, and infected more than 28,000.\nTwelve cases have been confirmed in the United States, none fatal. The latest patient, reported in Wisconsin on Wednesday, is isolated at home and “doing well,” the state health agency said in a statement.\nAs with nine other U.S. cases documented to date, that person fell ill after traveling to China and was exposed to known cases there, the state health department said. Just two confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases were transmitted person-to-person within the United States - both between spouses\n.\nThe protocols in place at Travis and Miramar were previously instituted at March Air Reserve Base near Los Angeles, where the first group of Americans airlifted from Wuhan landed last Wednesday and are midway through their quarantine.\nThe CDC said the government expects to fly additional groups of Americans and their families from China to other U.S. military bases designated for quarantine in Texas and Nebraska.\nAs part of a U.S. public health emergency declared on Jan. 31 in response to the coronavirus crisis, the Trump administration has barred U.S. entry of all foreign nationals who have recently visited China.\nThe CDC also has ordered a mandatory two-week quarantine for all U.S. travelers who have visited Wuhan or anywhere else in China’s Hubei Province during the past 14 days. Americans who traveled elsewhere in mainland China are subject to two weeks of self-quarantine and monitoring.\nAll commercial flights carrying Americans home from China will be directed to one of 11 U.S. international airports, where passengers will be screened by the CDC.\nThe State Department also has issued a “Do Not Travel” advisory warning U.S. citizens against visits to China.\n",

Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), kidney failure and death.\n** Like other coronaviruses, the newly identified China coronavirus is being transmitted from person-to-person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n** Infection with the newly identified virus has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and there are limited accounts that it may also be spreading before symptoms show.\n** Infectious disease and virus specialists say the scale of the current outbreak now points to “self-sustaining” human-to-human transmission. They estimate that each infected person is infecting, on average, two to three more people.\n** Testing for the new China virus involves using a real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which identifies the viral RNA in a sample. These samples could be from throat swabs, cough samples, or blood samples from patients who are very ill.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "In addition, some Chinese netizens who are infected with the virus have revealed that they are getting better after taking AIDS drugs. Does this mean there is a link between the new coronavirus and HIV?\nIn this regard, Fargo interviewed French experts in the field of coronavirus research, Professor Isabelle Imbert, a scholar at the University of Aix Marseille in South France, and Professor Anne goffard, a coronavirus research expert at the University of Lille in North France.\nNeither of the above scholars has heard of the Indian scholars' articles. For them, it is unbelievable that the new coronavirus carries the HIV gene sequence.\nProfessor Anne goffard said straightforwardly: she has personally verified the gene sequence of the new coronavirus submitted by China, which has no HIV component at all. It's all bullshit. She confirmed that the virus was not a product of \"human intervention.\". She called on people to think with their own brains and not easily believe any rumors on the Internet.\nShe further explained: \"coronavirus and HIV are two very different viruses. From a virological point of view, it is absolutely impossible for them to appear at the same time unless they are genetically manipulated and modified in the laboratory. However, no laboratory in the world will make similar manipulation, and it will take time, at least six months to a year to do so. We must stop spreading rumors of conspiracy theory, which is a virus from animals to humans. \"\nProfessor Isabelle Imbert, a scholar at the University of Aix Marseille, also told Taiwan: \"if we compare the gene sequence of the new coronavirus with that of SARS virus in Guangdong Province in 2003, we can clearly find the common ground between the two. I still think bats should be the main source of many kinds of coronaviruses, and we have provided enough evidence in dealing with the last SARS virus. I think this time, the virus from bats has found the right protein base in humans to effectively add to the replication. \"\nSo, if the new coronavirus patients take AIDS drugs can have curative effect, does this mean that the new coronavirus is related to AIDS?\nIn response, Professor Isabelle Imbert replied that the two should not be confused\n。 In the aspect of antiviral, there have been many studies in this field. Some small molecules in the drug will enter the virus tissue and prevent the further propagation of the virus, and the growth of each virus depends on replication. Although the new coronavirus and HIV are not the same kind of virus at all, because chromosomes compile proteins into different sequences, and despite their different shapes, antiviral molecules can still prevent their reproduction. But that doesn't mean there is any link between the coronavirus and HIV. This is ridiculous!\nIn addition, Gilead company claims to develop a new pneumonia drug, ridcivir, which has cured a patient in the United States. However, Gilead Gilead company is very careful to declare that \"ridcivir is a drug under research, which has not been approved for market in any country, its safety and effectiveness have not been confirmed, and there is no number of therapeutic effects against the new coronavirus at present According to. The company claims to be exempt from patent in China. According to the introduction, Gilead's medicine is developed on the basis of the medicine for treating Ebola virus. Is similar medicine feasible?\nIn response, Professor Isabelle Imbert replied: \"this is developed by Gilead, a pharmaceutical company in the United States. Their information is public. They have also developed drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C. They found a very effective chemical molecule to treat Ebola, which is a very effective medicine. The drug is also used to treat SARS and Morse coronavirus, and the effect is very significant. This is because the two viruses are homologous to Ebola's virus.

        "news_content_translate_en": "According to a report by the Central News Agency today, the Lancet journal points out that there may be multiple foci of pneumonia in Wuhan. According to a recent Wuhan pneumonia research paper published by the lancet, a British Medical Journal, from the top 41 patients admitted to Jinyintan hospital in Wuhan, China, the South China seafood market is not the only place where the new pneumonia epidemic originated, but may be a large area with multiple foci.\nAccording to the report, a paper published by lancet on the 24th local time disclosed the situation of the top 41 patients admitted to Jinyintan hospital. A chart in the paper shows that three of the top four infected people have no history of exposure to the South China seafood market, which has been regarded as the focus of the South China seafood market. Huang Zhaolin, vice president of the Wuhan golden Yin Tan Hospital, said: \"from the whole epidemic situation, the seafood market is not the only source of exposure,\" the origin of the new coronavirus is multisource. Cao Bin, the correspondence author and chief physician of respiratory and Critical Medicine Department of China Japan Friendship Hospital, also said in reply to science: \"it seems clear now that the seafood market in South China is not the only focus, but to be honest, we don't know where the virus comes from.\"\nAccording to the paper, the first case of new coronavirus infection in the hospital was recorded in December 1, 2019. There was no history of exposure to the seafood market in Southern China. No fever or respiratory symptoms were reported in the family. In December 10th, only 3 people were infected. Two of them did not have a history of exposure to the seafood market in Southern China. Of the top 41 patients admitted to Jinyintan hospital, only 27 had contact with the South China seafood market.\nAccording to the 26 China Disease Control and Prevention Center, 585 samples from Southern China seafood market detected 33 samples containing new coronavirus nucleic acids, and successfully isolated virus from positive environmental samples, suggesting that the virus originated from wild animals sold in Southern China seafood market. These positive samples were distributed in 22 stalls and 1 garbage truck on the market\n。\nTang Jinling, Professor of epidemiology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, was quoted as saying, \"there should be multiple sources of viruses in the South China seafood market at that time, and they are relatively scattered. Dozens of patients appear at the same time in a short period of time, and there is no history of contact with each other, indicating that the infected wild animals may not accidentally enter a stall, but enter multiple doors at the same time in a short period of time Shop, this can cause so many people at the same time. According to him, the virus may have become more common in wild animal infectious sources, which increases the possibility of these animals entering other markets or re entering the market and infecting human beings.\nAccording to the report, Tang Jinling said that the original birthplace may not be a point, but a large area, and there is the possibility of people passing on people. Considering that some of the initial infected people have no contact history with the seafood market in South China and have close contact history with the infected people, in addition to the seafood market in South China, it is also necessary to consider whether there is virus detection in other markets in Wuhan, so as to find out how large the scope of \"a large area\" is, so as to completely cut off the chance of reinfection of animals to human beings. But he also stressed that these assumptions are based on the limited information at present and need further investigation and verification.\n",

This is Xi Jinping's second confidence in the world. In January 28th, Xi Jinping met with WHO director general Tan Desai, but little success. China's stock market plummeted, followed by global stock market turbulence.\nXi Jinping also said on Friday that China and the United States signed the first stage of the trade agreement, and that China will conscientiously implement the consensus and push forward Sino US cooperative relations.\nChina and the United States signed the first phase of the trade agreement on January 15, and Beijing promised to buy US goods and services worth US $200 billion within two years. The first phase of the U.S. - China trade agreement will take effect after February 14, when the U.S. will reduce tariffs on $120 billion worth of Chinese products by 7.5%. China will also need to implement regulations on the volume of purchases of US goods and domestic structural reform.\nU.S. President trump praised China's statement of preparing to implement the agreement during the call, saying the two countries will continue to closely communicate.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Stephen mnuchin said Thursday that despite the chaos caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus, he acknowledged that it would have a negative impact on the global economy, but there would be no heavy blow.\nThe global automobile production chain is impacted by the virus epidemic\nAgence France-Presse pointed out that the crisis triggered by the outbreak of the new coronavirus is hitting the global automotive industry, and has spread from China to other countries. The new supply of coronavirus has caused the interruption of the supply chain of China's manufacturing parts, resulting in the announcement of a total stoppage of production this week by the modern automobile group, the largest automobile manufacturer in Korea.\nEuropean auto production has also been affected, with Italian and US car brands Fiat Chrysler saying that if Chinese parts suppliers fail to resume production as soon as possible, they will be forced to reduce production and the company may be forced to suspend operations at an assembly plant in Europe.\nThe analysis points out that the next few weeks are crucial for global automakers. Parts made in China are used to assemble millions of cars, and Wuhan, the hardest hit area of this coronavirus epidemic, is also the main center of auto parts production and transportation. In order to control the epidemic, some factories in China are expected to return to work after February 10.\nOther global automakers say they are concerned about the risks to the auto industry\n。\nGM's chief financial officer pointed out that the group has multiple teams working intensively to avoid problems.\nAlthough some auto manufacturers can transfer production, they need time to establish auto parts production lines and diversify the production chain.\nDelay or cancellation of several major exhibitions\nThe new coronavirus has killed at least 636 people and infected tens of thousands of people. The Art Basel, originally scheduled to be held in Hong Kong at the end of March, has been cancelled. The world-renowned annual meeting of contemporary art attracts artists and collectors from all over the world, which is undoubtedly another blow to Hong Kong's economy.\nIn addition, more than 20 large-scale trade fairs and conferences in Asia have been postponed or cancelled. For example, China's oldest and largest trade fair, Guangzhou Fair, has been suspended. During these meetings, sales contracts signed reached tens of billions of dollars.\n",

On January 29, Tibetan officials announced the discovery of a suspected case, which was finally confirmed on January 30, the source said. At this point, all provinces and cities in China have found confirmed cases. Tibet, the last pure land, has been occupied for many days.\nSo far, the whole country is red! All this is due to a straightforward young man from Hubei Province.\nThe article said that on January 29, Tibet officially issued a circular. Zhang, 34 years old, male, from Suizhou City, Hubei Province, arrived at Lhasa city by train from Wuchang from January 22 to 24, and went to the designated medical institution of Tibet Autonomous Region on the evening of January 25 to see a doctor, receive admission and receive isolation treatment. In January 28th, the test was identified as a suspected case of a new coronavirus infection.\nThis is the first suspected case of a new coronavirus infection in Tibet. Tibetan officials announced on January 30 that a suspected case had been confirmed.\nOn January 30, the Tibetan government issued another circular. According to the latest diagnostic procedures of the national health and Health Committee on the first case of pneumonia caused by new coronavirus in various provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), as well as the diagnosis and treatment plan of the new coronavirus infection (trial version fourth), the first suspected case in Tibet autonomous region is Zhang Mou, the case sample is checked by the center for Disease Control and prevention of the autonomous region, and the laboratory of the China Center for Disease Control and prevention is rechecked. The first confirmed case of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus infection was confirmed according to the clinical manifestations and the consultation of the expert group of the autonomous region.\nAt present, the patient is being hospitalized in a designated medical institution, with stable vital signs and close contacts undergoing medical isolation observation. This is the first confirmed case of a new coronavirus infection in Tibet.\nOn January 30, the city of Lhasa took action, announcing an urgent search for passengers on the same train as the man, the source said.\nThe announcement showed more details: Zhang took the train from Wuhan Wuchang railway station at 23:00 p.m. on January 22, arrived in Xining, Qinghai Province on the evening of January 23, and transferred once\n。 As early as January 20, the epidemic broke out completely. By January 22, all news media and people on the Internet were discussing the epidemic. On January 23, Wuhan was closed! In the era when smart phones are so popular, people all over the country are talking about the epidemic in Hubei. This 34 year old may not know all this information???\nThe most questionable thing is that he arrived in Lhasa on the afternoon of the 24th. The next day, he took the initiative to go to the designated medical institution in Lhasa city to be hospitalized and receive isolation treatment! On the morning of January 29, due to the occurrence of this case, Tibet was forced to urgently announce the launch of level I response to major public health emergencies in the whole region!!!\nThe article said that the current epidemic situation is very serious. Tibet has been defending for many days and finally lost. The willfulness of the Hubei people not only affects the public health and safety of the whole Tibetan area, but also affects the whole country's people to find two trains for isolation.

Caixin reports that Li needs doctors and nurses to take care of his daily life.\nA month ago, at 17:48 on December 30 last year, Li Wenliang released a message to a crowd of 150 students, saying: \"seven SARS cases have been confirmed in the South China fruit and seafood market and isolated in the emergency department of our hospital.\". On the same day, the \"emergency notice on the treatment of pneumonia of unknown causes\" issued by Wuhan health and Health Committee was also circulated on the Internet, which required strict information reporting and stressed that \"no unit or individual shall release treatment information without authorization\".\nLi Wenliang's reminder in wechat group opened Pandora's box. A group friend posted a screenshot of his conversation on the Internet without hiding the most critical information: his name and career. This made the person who saw the screenshot find him accurately. Soon he was invited by the hospital supervision department to talk about it. On January 3, he signed a \"admonition book\" warning of \"illegal issues\" at the local police station.\nCaixin reported that after the outbreak intensified on January 20, Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist, was infected during his reception and his condition deteriorated into the intensive care unit. In addition, many of his colleagues and parents also contracted a new coronavirus pneumonia.\nLi said in an interview with Caixin that he had known that the new virus could be passed from person to person in the early morning, \"obviously there are people to people. Around January 8, I took care of this kind of patients myself. At that time, a patient in our ophthalmology department was admitted to the hospital with acute angle closure glaucoma. His appetite was poor on the same day, but his temperature was normal. At first, we didn't think about other places. Later, her glaucoma and intraocular pressure were normal. The next day, she still had a bad appetite. At noon, she had a fever. The lung CT showed that it was \"viral pneumonia\". Other indicators met the standard of unexplained pneumonia.\nAccording to Caixin's interview, Li said that the family who took care of her that night also had a fever, and her other daughter also had a fever, which was an obvious human to human transmission. We immediately reported to the medical department and the hospital sense office, and invited the hospital expert group for consultation. After consultation, we suggested that the patient should be isolated in our department\n。 Three days later, we reexamined CT for him, and the result was \"viral pneumonia\", and the scope was expanded, and the condition was aggravated. Then the patient was transferred to the isolation ward of respiratory medicine, and I didn't know the situation after that.\nLi Wenliang talked about his experience of becoming a news figure because he was the first to release news in a personal group. \"It was this screenshot (group information) that came out that night (December 31) at 1:30 in the morning, and the Wuhan Health Care Commission held a meeting overnight. I was mainly called by the leaders of our hospital to ask about the situation. After I went to work at dawn, I was interviewed by the supervision department of the hospital. I was still asked about my situation, the source of the information, the process of the incident and whether I realized the mistake.\n\"I didn't expect the police would come to me,\" Li said. On January 3, they called me to sign the admonition book at the police station. I had never dealt with the police before. I was worried at that time. If I didn't sign it, I was afraid that I couldn't get away. I went and signed after the process. I didn't tell my family about it. At that time, I was under a lot of pressure. I was worried about the hospital's punishment, which would affect my future job promotion and so on. Later, a classmate of mine got to know and helped to introduce the reporter. I told the reporter about these situations directly.\nOn January 28, the Supreme Court issued a comment on whether eight \"rumor mongers\" in Wuhan were punished properly on the official account, while Li Wenliang's name was not among the eight. Li Wenliang said: \"after seeing the article of the Supreme Court, my heart relaxed a lot and I was not worried about the treatment of the hospital. I think a healthy society should not have only one voice, and do not agree to use public power to intervene excessively. I still agree with the Supreme Court's article, which should be specifically screened.

Molecular biologists from China and Canada analyzed the evolutionary nature of the 2019 ncov virus, which caused pneumonia in China and other countries, and concluded that this was not a single cause, These are two pathogens. The scientists' conclusions are contained in an article published by the biorxiv Electronic Science Library.\nOur analysis showed that the outbreak was caused by at least two different strains. Most likely, it began a few months ago, its presence was known, and began to formally inform the health authorities - researchers wrote.\nScientists from the University of Ottawa (Canada) and Shanghai Fudan University (China) studied two dozen small mutations in the complete 2019 ncov genome set, and came to this conclusion. Blood was extracted from patients in hospitals in Wuhan and other cities in China.\nGeneticists compared these data with RNA fragments of other coronaviruses, including SARS and mers fever in the Middle East. This allows researchers to restore the evolution tree of virus 2019 ncov and understand when common ancestors of all pathogens that exist today emerged.\nThe scientists made two unexpected discoveries\nAbout First, the virus did not appear in early or mid December, but about three or even six months ago. Secondly, biologists found a set of unique mutations in 2019 ncov samples collected in Wuhan. This clearly shows that the outbreak of this viral pneumonia has at least two puerperas.\nAt present, the researchers point out that it is not clear whether the isolation occurred before the virus began to infect the human body or after the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan. The fact that the pathogen has two different claims, they say, raises questions in itself about the theory that the city's exotic food market is the only source of the virus.\n",

The Washington Post identified him as Hong Ling, a 53-year old geneticist who studied rare diseases at Berkeley. A Japanese man who also died in Wuhan was another suspected victim.\nAs millions of Chinese prepared to go back to work, the public dismay and mistrust of official numbers was evident on\nWeibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter.\n“What’s even more frustrating is that these are only the ‘official’ data,” said one user.\n“Don’t say anything else\n. We all know we can’t purchase masks anywhere, why are we still going back to work?” said a second.\n“More than 20,000 doctors and nurses around the country have been sent to Hubei, but why are the numbers still rising?” asked a third.\nOf the coronavirus deaths, 81 were in China’s central Hubei province, where the virus has infected most people by far. New deaths in Hubei’s capital Wuhan saw a rare decline.\nNew infection cases on Saturday recorded the first drop since Feb. 1, falling back below 3,000 to 2,656 cases. Of those, 2,147 cases were in Hubei province.\nThe total of confirmed coronavirus cases in China stood at 37,198 cases, the commission data showed.\nJoseph Eisenberg, professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan, said it was too early to say whether the epidemic was peaking.\n“Even if reported cases might be peaking, we don’t know what is happening with unreported cases,” he said. “This is especially an issue in some of the more rural areas.”\nThe virus has spread to 27 countries and regions, according to a Reuters count based on official reports, infecting more than 330 people. Two deaths have been reported outside mainland China - in Hong Kong and the Philippines.

Singaporeans reacted by clearing out supermarket shelves of rice, noodles and toilet paper. On Sunday, the central bank in the Asian financial hub advised financial institutions to step up precautions for staff.\nThe government also said it had organized a second evacuation flight for 174 Singaporeans and their family members in Wuhan.

The Landrat of the Kreis Germersheim said they were in\nthe South Palatinate barracks tested positive for the virus and was transported with an infectious vehicle to the Uniklinik Frankfurt.\n\"The persons concerned have recorded these findings and have been isolated,\" the County Communication said. For the volunteers and the population there was \"no need to worry\".\nBoth people had shown no signs of infection when they arrived in Germany, Health Minister Jens Spahn said: \"Both when they left for China and when they arrived in Frankfurt, these two patients were symptomless.\" They were now being examined in the Frankfurt University Clinic. According to the medical director Jurgen Graf, the two patients are \"medically well\".\nThe 124 returnees and returnees were on board a\nGerman military machine landed at Frankfurt Airport and were first\na medical center brought in a converted gym. There were\nshe interviews and examines. After that eleven people went directly to the hospital\nbrought. One of them suspected a coronavirus infection, but it was not confirmed.\nThe other patients were taken to the clinic for other medical problems. The remaining returnees will have to spend the next two weeks in\nQuarantine in the South Palatinate barracks. The authorities said,\nthe danger to the population was small.\nBefore the two\nnew cases had nine Germans with the virus\nInfected. In Bavaria, the Ministry of Health reported an eighth disease case on Saturday,\nwhile Spain announced that a German tourist has been exposed to the Coronavirus\ninfected\nYeah. The Coronavirus has an incubation period of up to two weeks,\nwhere there are no symptoms yet. Nevertheless, there may be an infection.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. Am 21\nYeah. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite.\nYeah. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nIn China, the country of origin of the virus,\nthe epidemic continues to spread. On Saturday, the country experienced the strongest increase in infections and deaths in one day. The\nHealth Commission in Beijing reported almost 2.000 new\nSick and 45 dead.\nThus, in China as a whole, 304\nPeople died of respiratory disease, more than 14.000\nPeople are infected. In the meantime, however, there was also a\nFirst death outside China, in the Philippines. From Wuhan the\nVirus spread to 24 other countries. More and more countries, including Germany and France, are fleeing from the infected area.\nAccording to Chinese researchers, the corona virus can spread not only through droplets, but also through the digestive system. The doctors also found the virus in stool samples and rectal swabs after finding that some patients had only diarrhoea instead of fever. The research involved the University of Wuhan and the Virus Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the province capital of Hubei.\nWhile more and more people are becoming infected, there is also good news: scientists at the Lazzaro Spallanzani Institute of Infectious Diseases in Rome have managed to isolate the Coronavirus.\" This is an important news internationally,\"said Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza. It means that there are more opportunities to understand and study [the virus] in order to contain it.\"The results would be made available to the international community for further research.\nInvestigations are also carried out at the specialist institute in the case of a Corona suspect in Italy\nYeah. In Italy, there are two confirmed cases of Chinese tourists infected with the virus from their home country. The researchers said they could have isolated the virus for the two patients less than 48 hours after the diagnosis. Australian scientists had already bred the Coronavirus in the laboratory a few days ago.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "With the continuing rise in the number of cases of new lung disease in China, concern is growing worldwide. In Germany, for the first time, an infection with the dangerous lung disease has been confirmed. In this country, where further suspicions have become known, as in Bremen and Bremerhaven, consequences are being taken.\nThe Federal Government is considering leaving China voluntarily. A possible evacuation will be considered, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas (SPD) said on Monday in Berlin. The Foreign Office therefore assumes a two-digit number of Germans in the region concerned. The crisis staff met this morning to discuss further action.\nOther countries, such as France and the United States, have already initiated such recovery operations. The embassy is in contact with the Germans on the ground, it was said by Maas. \"We are testing and preparing for all options.\" He also advised against travelling to China. \"Travellers should consider not postponing or refraining from compulsory travel to China.\"\nSeveral German tour operators also face consequences: customers who have booked a trip to China can reschedule or cancel upcoming trips. Thus, Tui customers who wanted to travel to China in the next two weeks can change their travel dates free of charge. Currently, Tui has few guests in the country. \"We are in contact with the authorities and are monitoring the situation closely,\" said a speaker.\nTHE TOURISM offers free cancellations and rescheduling for Chinese trips with departure dates up to 31. March on. Currently, there are almost three digits of guests in the country. They would be kept up to date with SMS and hang-ups in the hotels, explained THE Tourist Board. The situation was closely monitored. Guests of the FTI Group may, according to the organiser Trips with departure date up to and including 21\nYeah. Reverse or cancel February free of charge.\nStudiosus said meanwhile travel to the country up to including 15. April. \"In view of the continuing deterioration of the situation and the tightening of the travel instructions of the Foreign Office, we do not currently see any possibility of carrying out planned Chinese tours,\" the provider announced on his homepage. Rapid relaxation is not expected. There is currently no travel warning for China.\nChina is rather a small market for German organisers. The German Travel Association (DRV) pointed out that every year, about 600'82010;000 to 650'8201000, German citizens travel to the country. About two thirds of them are business travellers.\nGuests from China are of greater importance for German tourism. According to recent data 2018, about three million overnight stays were counted by Chinese travellers in hotels, pensions and other accommodation between Rugen and Garmisch-Partenkirchen. They thus occupied twelve in the ranking of foreign vacationers. The main travel season is the summer months. \"The high spending behaviour of the Chinese with a turnover of six billion Euro 2018 reflects the economic importance for retailers and tourism and leisure industries in the travel country of Germany,\" said Petra Hedorfer, Chairman of the Board of the German Centre for Tourism (DZT). According to DZT Munich, Frankfurt, Berlin and Cologne, the popularity scale is very high.\nFear of the consequences of the virus depressed the mood in the stock markets on Monday. The Dax yielded directly to the start of trade 1,5 percent. In Japan, the Nikkei had to endure with more than two percent the strongest minus for six months, and the Dow Jones also gave in. Stock exchanges in China are closed due to the New Year celebration until Thursday. Tourism values such as Lufthansa and luxury goods manufacturers were particularly under pressure\nYeah.\nGiven the importance of the People's Republic for the world economy, there is growing concern that a weakening of local economic power could have far-reaching consequences for other countries as well. The usual crisis reactions can already be seen: supposedly safe and virus-independent equipment such as gold, Swiss francs or bitcoin gained value on Monday.\nDecember 2019: First infections become known. They are to go back to a market in the capital of Wuhan, where fish and wild animals are sold.\n31. December: 27 Patients are identified, the health authority in Wuhan informs.\nSix. January: In Wuhan, the number of diseases increases to 59, suspected cases in Hong Kong and Singapore. The WHO is intervening.\nNine. January: Experts identify the new Coronavirus as the pathogen according to the WHO.\n11. January: Chinese authorities report a first death.\n14. January: According to the WHO, the pathogen is detected for the first time in Thailand and thus abroad.\nTwenty. January: The Coronavirus is transmissible from person to person, according to Chinese experts. The number of confirmed infections has increased to 200, with three deaths.\n22. January: The number of deaths in China has risen to 17th, Wuhan says.\n24./25. January: The Coronavirus has reached Europe, three cases are known in France. For fear of further proliferation, more than 43 million people in China are largely cut off from the outside world. Authorities are reporting 41 deaths. There are also cases in the USA, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Nepal, Singapore, Taiwan and Australia.\n26. January: The Chinese authorities are now talking about around 2000 infected and 56 deaths.\n27. January: The number of deaths has risen again by 24 to 80. Within one day the number of confirmed infections with the new Coronavirus climbs by more than 700 to 2744. With around fifty cases outside China, so far almost 2800 cases are confirmed worldwide\nYeah. Suspicious cases in Peine, Berlin and Rostock, which did not confirm at the weekend, are followed by the Bremer suspect case. In the late evening, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health in Munich announced that a man from the district of Starnberg in Bavaria had infected himself with the pathogen.\n28. January: The infection with the new Coronavirus has now cost more than 100 people their lives in China.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK — A respiratory virus that is so new it does not yet have a name has spread quickly from Wuhan, China, leaving many experts to fear what may become a pandemic of pneumonia-like illness. \n So far, the virus — a coronavirus whose scientific designation is 2019-nCoV — has spread to at least 23 countries, infecting more than 17,000 people and killing at least 360. Most of the cases, so far, have been in China. \n But the novel coronavirus may be highly transmissible, as contagious as seasonal influenza, and the death rate is still unknown. \n The World Health Organization has estimated that one in every 50 infected individuals will die, and medical reports suggest the new virus can be transmitted even before an infected individual displays symptoms — a combination of factors that, if accurate, will make it nearly impossible to contain. \n Last week the WHO declared a global public health emergency, and made plans to dispatch experts to China to help with the investigation and containment. \n The United States also declared a public health emergency and has offered assistance, and is barring entry by most foreign nationals who have visited China recently. American travellers returning from trips in the Wuhan/Hubei region will be quarantined for two weeks. \n The outbreak appears to have begun at a seafood and meat market in Wuhan. Since then it has spread to other parts of China, and turned up in other countries in Asia and in Australia, Europe and North America. \n Chinese authorities cordoned off Wuhan days before the Chinese New Year holiday, suspending transportation in and out of the provincial seat of Hubei and other affected cities, closing in an estimated 50 million people. \n Federal health officials are urging Americans to avoid all travel to China, and have quarantined 195 Americans evacuated from Wuhan for 14 days\n. \n “This is a very serious public health situation, and the CDC and federal government have and will continue to take aggressive action to protect the public,” said Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The quarantine of a planeload of American evacuees in Southern California was an “unprecedented action”, she added, provoked by an “unprecedented threat”. \n As of Monday (Feb 3), 11 cases have been confirmed in the United States, most of them in patients who had travelled to China. One patient who had not travelled was apparently infected by his wife when she returned from China. More than 100 other patients in the United States are being tested. \n Experts cannot yet say who is at greatest risk for developing severe or life-threatening disease, and what factors may be protective against the illness. \n Here’s what we have learned so far about the virus and the outbreak. \n WHAT IS A CORONAVIRUS? \n Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their membranes, which resemble a crown or the sun’s corona. They can infect both animals and people, and can cause illnesses of the respiratory tract. The infections can range from the common cold to dangerous conditions like severe acute respiratory syndrome, or Sars, which sickened thousands of people around the world — and killed nearly 800 — during an outbreak in 2003. Middle East respiratory syndrome, or Mers, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is also caused by a coronavirus. \n HOW DANGEROUS IS IT? \n It is hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus, and some scientists said initially that the new virus appeared to be less severe than other coronaviruses, like Sars or Mers. \n But recent news reports indicate the Chinese authorities muzzled doctors who were first to recognise the new infection, and they may not have been fully transparent about the number of infections and deaths even after the alarm was raised\n. \n It is also not clear whether cases and deaths in China are being carefully tracked and reported. Diagnostic kits and other health resources have been in short supply in the affected regions. \n Last week, the WHO said that while the majority of patients with the new coronavirus have mild disease, 20 per cent develop severe illness, including pneumonia, respiratory failure and sometimes death. \n The WHO estimated the death rate among those infected at 2 per cent. That’s as high as the death rate of the pandemic Spanish flu in 1918. \n Scientists don’t know who is most susceptible to the new coronavirus. Does it pose a risk to young healthy people? Or, like seasonal flu, is it primarily a threat to the frail and elderly, and those with underlying health problems? \n “Whenever a new virus comes out, it takes a while to learn about it,” said Dr Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Right now, she said, “The information about coronavirus is changing rapidly.” \n HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INFECTED, AND HOW MANY HAVE DIED? \n At least 17,000 people are known to have been infected, and at least 360 have died. Most of the infected lived in Wuhan or had recently travelled there. \n Epidemics caused by other members of the coronavirus family, Sars and Mers, have had high death rates: 10 per cent for Sars, and about 35 per cent for Mers. \n Influenza kills more people every year, but its mortality rate is only about 0.1 per cent. The number of deaths is high because so many people become infected. \n Widespread coronavirus epidemics have the potential to take a heavy toll, so the health authorities scramble to stamp them out. \n A major concern is that with both Sars and Mers, a few patients inexplicably became “superspreaders” who infected huge numbers of people. \n Health care workers are particularly vulnerable. At a hospital in Seoul, South Korea, in 2015, one man with Mers transmitted it to 82 patients\n. \n HOW IS IT TRANSMITTED? \n Most respiratory viruses are transmitted through coughing and sneezing, but troubling new evidence suggests people who are infected with the new virus may be spreading it before they even know that they have any symptoms. \n Though Chinese authorities played down the likelihood of human-to-human transmission at first, it has now become clear there is significant and sustained transmission from person to person. \n In Germany, a 35-year-old businessman was infected by a colleague visiting from Shanghai. She was healthy during her trip to Germany, and only fell ill during her flight home. Three other employees of the man’s company were also infected; two of them had had no contact with the visitor. \n That’s “bad news”, said Dr William Schaffner, an expert in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \n When people don’t know they are infected, “they’re up and about, going to work or the gym or to religious services, and breathing on or near other people”, Dr Schaffner said. \n “Obviously sick people constrain themselves, and you have fewer opportunities for the virus to spread from one person to another.” \n WHERE DID THE NEW CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK START? \n On Jan 8, The New York Times reported that Chinese researchers had identified a new coronavirus as the pathogen behind a mysterious illness that had sickened 59 people in Wuhan. \n The cases were linked to a market that sold live fish, animals and birds. The market was later shut down and disinfected. \n Past outbreaks of similar illnesses, including Sars, also are believed to have emerged from live animal markets. The coronavirus that causes Mers is transmitted to humans by camels. \n The animal that was the source of the new coronavirus is still not known, and the destruction of the Wuhan meat market has made the question nearly impossible to investigate. \n Bats are considered a possible source, because they have evolved to coexist with many viruses, including coronaviruses\n. But it’s very possible the virus was transmitted from bats to an intermediate animal, and then to humans. \n WHAT SYMPTOMS SHOULD I LOOK OUT FOR? \n Symptoms of this virus include fever, severe cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. The illness causes lung lesions and pneumonia. Milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult. \n Patients may exhibit other symptoms too, such as gastrointestinal problems or diarrhoea. The incubation period — the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms — is believed to be anywhere from a few days to two weeks. \n If you have a fever or cough and recently visited China, or spent time with someone who did, see your health care provider. Call first, so they can prepare for your visit and take steps to protect other patients and staff from potential exposure. \n IS THERE A TEST FOR THE VIRUS? WHAT IS THE TREATMENT? \n There is a diagnostic test that can tell if you are infected. It was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on genetic information about the virus provided by Chinese authorities. \n Right now tests are done by the CDC in Atlanta, but the agency plans to share the test with states and laboratories as soon as it is refined. \n The main treatment for coronavirus is supportive care, including making sure the patient is getting enough oxygen, and using a ventilator to push air into the lungs if necessary, Dr Vaishampayan said. Patients should rest and drink plenty of fluids “while the immune system does its job and heals itself,” she said. \n No drugs have been approved for any coronavirus diseases, including the novel coronavirus, though an antiviral medication called remdesivir appears to be effective in animals and was used to treat a patient in Washington state. \n Chinese officials are also experimenting with at least one other HIV drug to treat the infection\n. \n HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO DEVELOP A VACCINE? \n A coronavirus vaccine is still months away — and perhaps years. While new technology, advancements in genomics and improved global coordination have allowed researchers to move at unprecedented speed, vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process. \n With each new outbreak, scientists typically have to start from scratch. After the Sars outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (The vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.) \n By the time of the Zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the vaccine development timeline down to six months. \n Now, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline further. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and several companies are working on vaccine candidates. \n Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a preliminary clinical trial may get off the ground in as little as three months. But researchers would still need to conduct extensive testing to prove a vaccine is safe and effective. \n Even under the best circumstances, it could take at least a year — maybe longer — for a vaccine to be available. \n SHOULD I WEAR A SURGICAL MASK TO PROTECT MYSELF? \n If you have a respiratory infection, wearing a mask helps protect the people around you from illness by reducing the risk that you will spread the infection. And wearing a surgical mask may somewhat protect you from infection in a crowd if there is an outbreak. \n But, generally, surgical masks are not closefitting enough to filter all the air you are breathing in and N95 respirators are extremely uncomfortable. \n Experts recommend washing your hands frequently throughout the day. Avoid touching your face, and maintain a distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing. \n I HAVE A TRIP PLANNED TO CHINA. SHOULD I GO? \n Not if you can avoid it\n. The State Department has warned Americans not to go to China unless it is absolutely essential. \n If travellers must go, the CDC urges enhanced precautions: avoiding contact with anyone who is sick, as well as with animals and the markets in which they are sold; and refraining from eating raw or undercooked meats. \n Anyone who is older or has an underlying health condition, which increases susceptibility to infections, should consult with a health provider before making a trip. Access to medical care in China may be difficult, given the outbreak, and federal officials warned that new travel restrictions could be imposed on return, including quarantine. \n WHAT ARE HEALTH AUTHORITIES DOING TO CONTAIN THE VIRUS? \n China has taken drastic actions to bar people from leaving affected areas, though 5 million people departed Wuhan alone before the restrictions went into effect. \n Residents have been told to wear masks in public to prevent the spread of the disease. Two new hospitals for coronavirus patients are being erected; the first opened on Monday. \n Governments around the world have been screening incoming passengers from China for signs of illness, and some have gone further, barring entry to people from China. Russia and Mongolia have closed most of their borders with China. Australia said it will evacuate citizens from Wuhan and quarantine them for 14 days on Christmas Island. \n CDC teams are also providing assistance with state health investigations of infections, including contact-tracing, which means making sure anyone who may have been in contact with an infected individual is warned of the exposure and their health is monitored. \n The work will enhance the understanding of the virus and how to prevent its spread. CDC teams have also offered to send public health experts to China to help with the investigation and containment efforts. THE NEW YORK TIMES\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "纽约——一种新的呼吸道病毒，它还没有名字，已经从中国武汉迅速传播开来，让许多专家担心可能成为肺炎样疾病的大流行。\n到目前为止，这种冠状病毒已经传播到至少23个国家，感染了17000多人，造成至少360人死亡。到目前为止，大多数病例都发生在中国。\n但这种新型冠状病毒可能具有高度的传染性，与季节性流感一样具有传染性，死亡率仍不清楚。\n世界卫生组织估计，每50名受感染者中就有一人死亡，医学报告显示，即使在受感染者出现症状之前，这种新病毒也可以传播——如果准确的话，这是一系列因素的组合，几乎无法控制。\n上周，世界卫生组织宣布全球公共卫生紧急状况，并计划派遣专家前往中国协助调查和遏制。\n美国还宣布进入公共卫生紧急状态并提供援助，并禁止最近访华的大多数外国人入境。在武汉/湖北地区旅行归来的美国旅客将被隔离两周。\n这场疫情似乎始于武汉的一家海鲜和肉类市场。从那时起，它蔓延到中国的其他地区，并出现在亚洲其他国家和澳大利亚、欧洲和北美。\n中国当局在春节假期前几天封锁了武汉，暂停了进出湖北省和其他受影响城市的交通，估计有5000万人被关闭。\n联邦卫生官员敦促美国人避免所有前往中国的旅行，并隔离了从武汉撤离的195名美国人14天\n.\n国家免疫和呼吸系统疾病中心主任南希·梅森尼尔博士说：“这是一个非常严重的公共卫生状况，疾控中心和联邦政府已经并将继续采取积极行动保护公众。”。她补充说，在南加州隔离一批美国撤离人员是“前所未有的行动”，是由“前所未有的威胁”引发的。\n截至星期一（2月3日），美国已确诊11例，其中大部分是前往中国的患者。一个没有旅行过的病人在妻子从中国回来时明显被感染了。美国还有100多名病人正在接受检查。\n专家还不能确定谁最有可能患上严重的或危及生命的疾病，以及哪些因素可能对这种疾病起到保护作用。\n以下是迄今为止我们对病毒和疫情的了解。\n什么是冠状病毒？\n冠状病毒的名字来源于它们膜上突出的穗状突起，类似于树冠或日冕。它们能感染动物和人，并能引起呼吸道疾病。感染范围从普通感冒到严重急性呼吸系统综合征（Sars）等危险疾病，在2003年的一次疫情中，全球数千人患病，近800人死亡。中东呼吸综合征（Mers）于2012年在沙特阿拉伯首次报道，也是由冠状病毒引起的。\n有多危险？\n很难准确评估一种新病毒的杀伤力，一些科学家最初说，这种新病毒似乎没有其他冠状病毒严重，如Sars或Mers。\n但最近的新闻报道显示，中国当局对最先发现新感染的医生实施了禁闭，即使在警报响起后，他们也可能对感染人数和死亡人数没有完全透明\n.\n目前还不清楚中国的病例和死亡是否被仔细追踪和报告。受影响地区的诊断包和其他卫生资源一直短缺。\n上周，世卫组织表示，虽然大多数新冠状病毒感染者病情轻微，但20%的患者会出现严重疾病，包括肺炎、呼吸衰竭，有时甚至死亡。\n世卫组织估计感染者的死亡率为2%。这相当于1918年西班牙流感的死亡率。\n科学家们不知道谁最容易感染这种新型冠状病毒。对健康的年轻人有危险吗？或者，像季节性流感一样，它主要是对身体虚弱的老年人和那些有潜在健康问题的人的威胁吗？\n美国传染病学会公共卫生委员会主席朱莉·瓦伊沙姆帕扬博士说：“每当一种新病毒出现，就需要一段时间来了解它。”。现在，她说，“关于冠状病毒的信息正在迅速变化。”\n有多少人被感染，有多少人死亡？\n已知至少有1.7万人感染，至少360人死亡。大多数感染者居住在武汉或最近去过那里。\n由冠状病毒家族其他成员Sars和Mers引起的流行病死亡率很高：Sars的死亡率为10%，Mers的死亡率约为35%。\n流感每年造成更多人死亡，但其死亡率仅为0.1%左右。死亡人数很高，因为有这么多人受到感染。\n广泛流行的冠状病毒有可能造成重大损失，因此卫生当局争相扑灭。\n一个主要的担忧是，在Sars和Mers中，一些病人莫名其妙地成为感染了大量人的“超级传播者”。\n卫生保健工作者尤其脆弱。2015年，在韩国首尔的一家医院，一名携带Mers的男子将其传染给82名患者\n.\n它是如何传播的？\n大多数呼吸道病毒是通过咳嗽和打喷嚏传播的，但令人不安的新证据表明，感染了这种新病毒的人可能在他们甚至不知道自己有任何症状之前就传播了这种病毒。\n尽管中国当局起初淡化了人与人之间传播的可能性，但现在已经清楚地看到，人与人之间存在着重大而持续的传播。\n在德国，一名35岁的商人被一名来自上海的同事感染。她在德国旅行期间身体健康，只是在回家的航班上生病了。该男子所在公司的另外三名雇员也受到感染；其中两人与来访者没有任何联系。\n范德比尔特大学医学中心传染病专家威廉·沙夫纳博士说，这是“坏消息”。\n沙夫纳博士说，当人们不知道自己被感染时，“他们会起来走动，去工作、健身房或宗教仪式，在别人身上或附近呼吸。”。\n“显然，病人会自我约束，病毒从一个人传播到另一个人的机会更少。”\n新的冠状病毒爆发是从哪里开始的？\n1月8日，《纽约时报》报道说，中国研究人员发现了一种新型冠状病毒，这是导致武汉59人患病的神秘疾病的病原体。\n这些案件与一个出售活鱼、动物和鸟类的市场有关。市场后来被关闭并消毒。\n据信，过去爆发的类似疾病，包括非典，也是从活的动物市场出现的。引起Mers的冠状病毒由骆驼传播给人类。\n作为新冠状病毒来源的动物至今仍不得而知，而武汉肉类市场的破坏也使得这一问题几乎无法调查。\n蝙蝠被认为是一种可能的来源，因为它们已经进化成与许多病毒共存，包括冠状病毒。\n. 但很有可能病毒是从蝙蝠传播到中间动物，然后再传播到人类。\n我应该注意什么症状？\n这种病毒的症状包括发烧、严重咳嗽、呼吸困难或呼吸短促。这种病会引起肺部病变和肺炎。较轻的病例可能类似流感或重感冒，使检测变得困难。\n病人也可能出现其他症状，如胃肠道问题或腹泻。潜伏期——从暴露到出现症状的时间——被认为是从几天到两周的任何时间。\n如果你有发烧或咳嗽，最近去过中国，或者和有发烧或咳嗽的人在一起，请咨询你的医疗保健提供者。先打电话，这样他们可以为你的来访做准备，并采取措施保护其他患者和工作人员免受潜在的接触。\n有病毒测试吗？治疗方法是什么？\n有一种诊断测试可以判断你是否被感染。它是由疾病预防控制中心根据中国当局提供的有关该病毒的基因信息开发的。\n目前，亚特兰大的疾病预防控制中心（CDC）正在进行检测，但该机构计划一经改进，就与各州和实验室共享检测结果。\nVaishampayan博士说，对冠状病毒的主要治疗是支持性护理，包括确保患者获得足够的氧气，必要时使用呼吸机将空气推进肺部。她说，病人应该休息，喝大量的液体，“而免疫系统却在发挥作用，自我康复。”。\n没有药物被批准用于任何冠状病毒疾病，包括新型冠状病毒，尽管一种名为remdesivir的抗病毒药物似乎对动物有效，并被用于治疗华盛顿州的一名患者。\n中国官员也在试验其他至少一种治疗艾滋病病毒感染的药物\n.\n研制疫苗需要多长时间？\n冠状病毒疫苗还有几个月的时间，也许还有几年。虽然新技术、基因组学的进步和全球协调的改善使研究人员以前所未有的速度前进，但疫苗开发仍然是一个昂贵和危险的过程。\n每次新的爆发，科学家通常都要从头开始。2003年非典爆发后，研究人员花了大约20个月的时间研制出一种疫苗，用于人体试验。（由于这种疾病最终得到控制，所以根本不需要疫苗。）\n到2015年寨卡病毒爆发时，研究人员已将疫苗研发时间缩短至6个月。\n现在，他们希望从过去爆发的疾病中所做的工作将有助于进一步缩短时间。美国国立卫生研究院和几家公司的科学家正在研究疫苗候选品。\n美国国家变态反应和传染病研究所所长安东尼·福西博士说，一项初步临床试验可能在短短三个月内开始。但是研究人员仍然需要进行广泛的测试来证明疫苗是安全有效的。\n即使在最好的情况下，疫苗至少需要一年——也许更长的时间——才能获得。\n我应该戴口罩来保护自己吗？\n如果你有呼吸道感染，戴口罩有助于保护你周围的人免受疾病的影响，降低你传播感染的风险。戴上外科口罩可以在一定程度上保护你免受人群感染。\n但是，一般来说，外科口罩不够贴身，无法过滤你吸入的所有空气，而且N95口罩非常不舒服。\n专家建议每天勤洗手。避免触摸你的脸，与咳嗽或打喷嚏的人保持距离。\n我计划去中国旅行。我该走了吗？\n如果你能避免\n. 美国国务院警告美国人，除非绝对必要，否则不要去中国。\n如果旅行者必须离开，疾控中心敦促加强预防措施：避免接触任何生病的人，以及动物和出售它们的市场；避免食用生的或未煮熟的肉类。\n任何老年人或有潜在的健康状况，这会增加感染的易感性，应该在旅行前咨询健康提供者。鉴于疫情爆发，中国可能很难获得医疗服务，联邦官员警告说，可能会对回国实施新的旅行限制，包括隔离。\n卫生当局正在做什么来控制病毒？\n中国采取了严厉措施，禁止人们离开灾区，尽管在限购令生效之前，仅武汉就有500万人离开。\n居民们被告知在公共场合戴口罩以防止疾病的传播。两所新的冠状病毒病人医院正在建设中；第一所医院星期一开业。\n世界各国政府一直在检查从中国入境的乘客是否有患病迹象，有些国家甚至更进一步，禁止来自中国的人入境。俄罗斯和蒙古已经关闭了大部分与中国的边境。澳大利亚表示，将疏散武汉市民，并在圣诞岛隔离14天。\n疾病预防控制中心的小组也在协助州卫生局对感染进行调查，包括接触者追踪，这意味着确保任何可能接触过感染者的人都受到接触警告，并对他们的健康进行监测。\n这项工作将增进对该病毒的了解以及如何防止其传播。中国疾控中心的工作组还表示，将派遣公共卫生专家前往中国，协助开展调查和遏制工作。纽约时报\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SHANGHAI/WASHINGTON - The United States ramped up its response to the coronavirus epidemic on Friday, declaring a public health emergency and saying it would halt entry to foreign nationals who had been to China within the 14-day incubation period.  \n That measure followed on from an earlier travel advisory that warned Americans not to travel to China and angered Beijing.  \n Originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the flu-like virus first identified earlier in January has resulted in 213 deaths in China, according to local health authorities. Wuhan and the surrounding region of Hubei are in virtual quarantine.  \n More than 9,800 people have been infected in China and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions, with Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reporting their first cases on Thursday or Friday.  \n The World Health Organization said on Thursday that the epidemic constituted a public health emergency of international concern, a designation that triggers tighter global containment measures and coordination.  \n \"Following the World Health Organization's decision... I have today declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States,\" U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said at a public briefing on Friday afternoon.  \n As of Sunday, U.S. citizens who had been in Hubei would be subject to compulsory quarantine, he said. Foreign nationals - aside from the immediate family of citizens and residents - who had travelled in China in the last 14 days would be denied entry, said Azar.  \n \"The risk is low in the United States... but our job is to keep that risk low as much as we can,\" he said.  \n The move will likely anger Beijing, which has only just started to mend tattered trade ties with Washington. Earlier on Friday, it criticized the U.S. travel warning\n.  \n \"The World Health Organization urged countries to avoid travel restrictions, but very soon after that, the United States did the opposite,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. \"It's truly mean.\"  \n Other countries have also advised citizens to put off non-urgent travel to China or restricted flights. After reporting its first two cases of the illness, Russia on Friday restricted direct flights to China, its biggest trade partner.  \n Singapore, a major travel hub in Asia, stopped entry of passengers with a recent history of travel to China and also suspended visas for Chinese passport holders.  \n Many airlines have chosen to cancel or reduce flights, with airline crews pressuring carriers to act.  \n Governments around the world are evacuating citizens from Hubei. A plane with 83 British and 27 foreign nationals landed in Britain on Friday, while Japan, with 14 confirmed cases, has sent three flights to bring citizens home.  \n The United States said it would channel all flights from China through seven airports. It has put 195 Americans evacuated to California this week in quarantine.  \n The virus has an incubation of between one and 14 days, and there are some limited signs it may also be able to spread before any symptoms show.  \n  \n GLOBAL REVERBERATIONS  \n With major fallout inevitable for China's economy, which is the world's second largest, global shares posted their biggest weekly and monthly losses since August on Friday. [MKTS/GLOB]  \n The outbreak could \"reverberate globally,\" Moody's said.  \n In the latest impact to big name corporations, South Korea's Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> said it planned to halt production of a sport utility vehicle this weekend due to a supply disruption caused by the outbreak.  \n Home appliance maker Electrolux <ELUXb.ST> issued a similar warning, French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen <PEUP.PA> said its three plants in Wuhan will remain closed until mid-February, and tractor maker Deere & Co <DE\n.N> said it was temporarily shutting its facilities in China.  \n WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said the WHO did not support travel or trade curbs. Tedros reiterated in a series of tweets on Friday that his organization had confidence in China's capacity to control the 2019-nCoV virus.  \n \"Travel restrictions can cause more harm than good by hindering info-sharing and medical supply chains and harming economies. We urge countries and companies to make evidence-based, consistent decisions.\"  \n  \n VIRUS EPICENTRE  \n The roughly 60 million residents of Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital, have had movements curbed to try and slow the spread of the disease. But some people were leaving and entering the area by foot on a bridge over the Yangtze river, a Reuters witness said, and infections have jumped in two cities flanking Wuhan.  \n China's statistics show just over 2% of infected people have died, suggesting the virus is less deadly than the 2002-2003 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  \n But economists say its financial impact could be bigger than SARS, which killed about 800 people at an estimated cost of $33 billion to the global economy, since China's share of the world economy is now far greater.  \n Like other respiratory infections, the coronavirus spreads between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes. No deaths have been reported outside China, but it is still too early to know what its death rate will be.  \n \"The issue now with this is that there's a lot of unknowns,\" said U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head Robert Redfield.  \n The WHO has reported at least eight cases of human-to-human transmission - as opposed to people coming infected from China - in four countries: the United States, Germany, Japan and Vietnam. Thailand said it too had such a case.  \n Graphic - Tracking China’s novel coronavirus: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index\n.html  \n Graphic - The Coronavirus Outbreak: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH/0100B59Y39P/index.html REUTERS\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE - Two more Singaporeans were confirmed to have been infected by the coronavirus, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (Feb 6). One did not travel to China recently and does not seem to be linked to previous cases. \n The 41-year-old patient with no apparent links to past cases tested positive for the virus late on Wednesday night. Contact tracing is still in progress, with a focus on identifying any links he may have with past cases or travellers from China. \n The other case announced on Thursday also has no recent travel history to China. The 27-year-old Singaporean, however, went to a conference at the Grand Hyatt Singapore hotel last month. Three other attendees - two South Koreans and a Malaysian - tested positive for the virus after they left Singapore. \n This brings the total number of confirmed cases here to 30, of which 11 are Singaporeans. \n So far, all previously announced confirmed cases have been either Chinese nationals from Hubei, or individuals with links to travellers who are Chinese nationals. \n All of these cases have been isolated and ring-fenced, said the MOH. \n \"But we must be prepared for the possibility of new infection clusters involving locals within the community, not linked with recent travel to China or contact with recent PRC travellers,\" said the ministry, noting that this has already happened in several places outside mainland China. \n “We stand ready to ramp up our measures even more once we have some findings from the ongoing investigations.” \n The two new cases announced on Thursday are in stable condition. Of the remaining cases, 25 are stable or improving, and one has been discharged. \n But the condition of two cases has worsened. \n One is now in critical condition in the intensive care unit, and another requires additional oxygen support\n. \n First case: He is a 41-year-old Singaporean who did not travel to China recently and, for now, does not appear to have links to previous cases. \n The man developed a fever on Jan 28 and visited a general practitioner clinic the next day. \n He sought treatment at another GP clinic on Jan 30 before he was admitted to Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital on Monday. He was confirmed to be infected on Wednesday night. \n The man was transferred to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) for further treatment and is warded in an isolation room. \n Epidemiological investigations and contact tracing are being done to identify people who had close contact with him, and to establish any link he may have had with confirmed cases in Singapore or travellers from mainland China. \n The MOH said it is interviewing the patient and his close contacts, and investigating the locations he recently visited. \n Second case: He is a 27-year-old Singaporean who also has no recent travel history to mainland China. \n He is one of the four Singapore residents being investigated at the NCID after attending a conference at the Grand Hyatt Singapore hotel from Jan 20 to 22. \n The MOH said 109 people attended the event at the hotel, including 15 Singapore residents. The remaining 94 overseas participants have left Singapore. \n The private business meeting included participants from China, including Hubei. Also at the event were two South Korean men and one Malaysian man confirmed to be infected after they left Singapore, prompting a World Health Organisation investigation into the case. \n The MOH did not reveal how, where or when the Malaysian and the two South Koreans were infected, according to Grand Hyatt Singapore. \n The 27-year-old Singaporean who attended the same conference was confirmed to have the coronavirus infection on Thursday. He is warded in an isolation room at the NCID\n. \n On Thursday, Malaysia said the sister of the infected Malaysian man who went to the Singapore conference was confirmed to have tested positive for the coronavirus, after coming into direct contact with him when he returned to Malaysia. \n After Japan's 45 cases, Singapore has the second-highest number of coronavirus infections outside of China. \n On Wednesday, four cases of the coronavirus infection were confirmed by the MOH, including the youngest patient confirmed so far, a six-month-old baby who is the child of an infected couple. The couple's maid was also infected. \n Three of Wednesday's cases are linked to a cluster of local transmissions - the first here - announced on Tuesday. The last case is an imported one involving a Chinese tourist from China's Wuhan city. \n The cluster of local transmissions is linked to a group of 20 tourists from Guangxi, China, that visited health products shop Yong Thai Hang in Cavan Road in Lavender. With the cases announced on Wednesday, the number of cases linked to the tour group is now seven. \n The MOH said the Chinese health authorities have confirmed that two travellers from the tour group have the coronavirus infection. \n The ministry said on Thursday that the infected six-month-old baby, a Singaporean, was cared for at home and was not in any infant care facility before he was admitted to hospital. \n The baby’s father, a 45-year-old Singaporean, developed symptoms last Saturday. He visited a GP clinic the next day and was later isolated at the NCID on Tuesday. \n Before he was admitted, he was at his home in Jalan Bukit Merah and worked as a private-hire driver. \n He visited Tiong Bahru Plaza, Tiong Bahru Market and Beo Crescent Market and Food Centre. \n The MOH said the risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low. \n The man’s wife works at the Yong Thai Hang shop, which caters to Chinese tour groups\n. \n The 28-year-old woman is a Singapore permanent resident who did not recently travel to China. On Tuesday, the MOH confirmed that she and the family’s foreign domestic helper, a 44-year-old Indonesian woman, were infected with the coronavirus. \n This was after Yong Thai Hang was visited by the tour group from Guangxi on Jan 23. The Singaporean tour guide of the group was later confirmed to be infected. \n The coronavirus, known as 2019-nCov, first emerged in Wuhan in December last year and has so far proven to be more infectious than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). \n As of Thursday, the outbreak has infected more than 28,000 people and killed more than 560, with Hong Kong reporting its first death from the coronavirus on Tuesday, the second fatality outside mainland China. \n The deceased was a 39-year-old man with an underlying illness. He had taken the high-speed train from Hong Kong to Wuhan city in Hubei province, and from Changsha in Hunan province to Hong Kong last month. \n Most of the deaths from the virus occurred in central Hubei province. \n In the wake of the outbreak, a growing number of countries, including Italy, the United States, Australia, Singapore, Japan and Russia, have put in place travel restrictions. Germany, France and the US have evacuated citizens from China. \n Several major airlines have also halted flights to and from China, deepening concerns of a widespread economic slowdown. \n In Singapore, measures to combat the outbreak include mask distribution at residents' committee centres and community centres islandwide, which began last Saturday. \n The Government announced on Jan 30 that all 1.3 million households in Singapore would be given a pack of four masks each amid reports of shops running out of stock\n. \n On Tuesday, the Government also said that large gatherings and communal activities, such as assemblies and excursions, will be suspended at schools, pre-schools and eldercare facilities here from Wednesday after the first local transmissions of the coronavirus were reported. \n The MOH said on Thursday that 310 suspected cases have tested negative for the virus so far. The test results for the remaining 147 cases are pending. \n The ministry has identified 435 close contacts of the confirmed cases. Of these, 353 are still in Singapore, with 348 already contacted and being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are being made to contact the remaining five close contacts. \n The MOH still advised Singaporeans to defer all travel to Hubei province and all non-essential travel to mainland China. \n Members of the public should also observe good personal hygiene such as frequently washing their hands with soap. \n They should also wear a mask if they have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath, and seek medical attention promptly if they are feeling unwell. \n CLICK TO LISTEN TO ST'S HEALTH CHECK PODCAST\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "MELBOURNE (BLOOMBERG) - The new coronavirus might have infected at least 500,000 people in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicentre of the global outbreak, by the time it peaks in coming weeks. \n The typically bustling megacity, where the so-called 2019-nCoV virus emerged late last year, has been in effective lockdown since Jan 23, restricting the movement of 11 million people. Recent trends in reported cases in Wuhan broadly support the preliminary mathematical modelling the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is using to predict the epidemic's transmission dynamics. \n \"Assuming current trends continue, we're still projecting a mid-to-late-February peak\" of virus cases in Wuhan, Adam Kucharski, an associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology, said by email Sunday (Feb 9). \"There's a lot of uncertainty, so I'm cautious about picking out a single value for the peak, but it's possible based on current data we might see a peak prevalence over 5 per cent.\" \n That would potentially mean at least 1 in 20 people would have been infected in the city by the time the epidemic peaks, Kucharski said, adding that this may change if transmission patterns slow in coming days. The prediction doesn't indicate a coming surge in cases in Wuhan, but that the current cumulative total doesn't reflect all infections, especially mild ones, that have occurred. \n Health authorities in China and around the world are anxiously waiting to know whether the world's largest known quarantine effort has been effective in containing the pneumonia-causing virus in Wuhan and across other cities in Hubei province, a landlocked region of 60 million people. \n Kucharski, whose research focuses on the dynamics of infectious diseases, and colleagues have based their modelling on a range of assumptions about the 2019-nCoV virus. These include an incubation period of 5\n.2 days, a delay from the onset of symptoms to confirmation of infection of 6.1 days, and about 10 million people being at risk of infection in Wuhan. \n Based on that, a prevalence of 5 per cent equates to about 500,000 cumulative infections. That's many times more than the 16,902 cases provincial health authorities had counted in Wuhan as of midnight Sunday. \n Researchers will gauge the proportion of people in the population who have been infected with 2019-nCoV after a test becomes available that enables them to conduct a so-called serosurvey to identify those whose blood contains antibodies produced in response to exposure to the virus. \n Currently, the true number of people in Wuhan exposed to the virus \"may be vastly underestimated,\" Manuel Battegay and colleagues at the University of Basel in Switzerland said in a study published Friday. \"With a focus on thousands of serious cases, mild or asymptomatic courses that possibly account for the bulk of the 2019-nCoV infections might remain largely unrecognised, in particular during the influenza season.\" \n Authorities in China have counted more than 37,000 cases - of which more than 800 have been fatal - over the past two months. That has surpassed the 774 fatalities from the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, over eight months, according to the World Health Organisation. \n In the first 17,000 or so cases, about 82 per cent are mild, 15 per cent severe and 3 per cent critical, the WHO said Friday. Of 138 patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in the first four weeks of January, 26 per cent were placed in intensive care and 4.3 per cent died, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association published Friday found\n. \n While the fast-moving, infectious coronavirus has caused thousands of people to fall gravely ill and overwhelm hospitals, once researchers understand the full spectrum of illness associated with the virus, the overall case-fatality risk is likely to be much less than 1 per cent, said Ian Lipkin, director of the Centre for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York. \n People with mild or no apparent symptoms aren't currently being counted among cases, he told reporters Sunday. A slowdown in the increase in reported cases over the past few days is \"meaningful,\" according to Lipkin, who recently returned to the U.S. from China, where he was advising on the outbreak. He spoke with journalists during a 14-day home quarantine. \n If measures taken so far to contain the outbreak are effective, some \"dramatic reductions\" in infections should be observed in the third or fourth weeks of February, he said. Warmer, early-spring weather might also impede transmission, he said. \n Some studies indicate an infected person may not display symptoms for 14 days or more, with testing and confirmation of cases adding to delays. This will prolong the time it will take to identify whether China's unprecedented disease-control measures have worked. \n \"The next two weeks are really critical to understand what's been happening,\" said Benjamin Cowling, head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong, in an interview in Melbourne on Thursday. \"And, is this going to spread into other locations, or have we avoided what could be a global pandemic because of the control measures that have been implemented to date?\" The number of cases reported in Wuhan and across Hubei province has been tracking downward over the past several days\n. \n \"There has been a stabilisation in the number of cases reported from Hubei, and we're in a four-day stable period where the number of reported cases hasn't advanced,\" Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, told reporters in Geneva Saturday. \"That's good news and may reflect the impact of the control measures that have been put in place.\" There has been a \"low, but steady incidence\" of infections in places outside Hubei, Ryan said. It's unclear which of those provinces may control the disease or where it might escalate, he said. \n \"We hope that the same stabilisation that appears to be occurring in Wuhan also occurs outside,\" Ryan said. \"But, again it's very, very, very early to make any predictions about numbers.\" \"This is still a very intense disease outbreak in Wuhan and Hubei, and there are still great risks in practically all of the other provinces, so we will wait and see,\" he said.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "墨尔本（彭博社）-新的冠状病毒可能已经在武汉感染了至少50万人，武汉是全球爆发的中心城市，在未来几周达到高峰。\n这座通常熙熙攘攘的特大城市，即所谓的2019年nCoV病毒去年底出现的地方，自1月23日以来一直处于有效封锁状态，限制了1100万人的流动。武汉报告病例的最新趋势广泛支持伦敦卫生与热带医学院用于预测流行病传播动力学的初步数学模型。\n传染病流行病学副教授亚当·库查尔斯基（Adam Kucharski）周日（2月9日）通过电子邮件说：“假设目前的趋势继续下去，我们仍预计武汉的病毒病例将在2月中下旬达到高峰。”有很多不确定性，所以我对挑选峰值的单个值持谨慎态度，但根据目前的数据，我们可能会看到峰值患病率超过5%。”\n库查尔斯基说，这可能意味着，到疫情高峰时，该市至少每20人中就有1人受到感染。他补充说，如果未来几天传播模式放缓，这种情况可能会改变。这一预测并不意味着武汉的病例数量将激增，但目前的累积总数并不能反映所有的感染，尤其是轻度感染。\n中国和世界各地的卫生当局正焦急地等待着世界上最大的已知隔离措施是否有效地遏制了武汉和湖北省其他城市的肺炎病毒，这是一个6000万人的内陆地区。\n库查尔斯基（Kucharski）的研究重点是传染病的动力学，他和同事的建模基于对2019年nCoV病毒的一系列假设。其中包括5个潜伏期\n.2天，从症状出现到确诊感染延误6.1天，武汉市约1000万人有感染风险。\n在此基础上，5%的流行率相当于约50万例累积感染。这是截至周日午夜武汉市省级卫生部门统计的16902例病例的数倍。\n研究人员将在进行一项测试后，评估2019年nCoV感染人群的比例，该测试使他们能够进行所谓的血清调查，以确定血液中含有因暴露于该病毒而产生的抗体的人群。\n瑞士巴塞尔大学（University of Basel）的曼纽尔•巴特盖（Manuel Battegay）和同事在上周五发表的一项研究报告中说，目前，武汉暴露于该病毒的真实人数“可能被大大低估”随着对数千例严重病例的关注，可能占2019年nCoV感染主要部分的轻度或无症状病程可能在很大程度上仍未被发现，特别是在流感季节。”\n在过去的两个月里，中国当局统计了37000多起病例，其中800多起是致命的。根据世界卫生组织（who）的数据，这已经超过了2002-2003年8个月内爆发的严重急性呼吸系统综合症（SARS）的774例死亡人数。\n世卫组织星期五说，在最初的1.7万例左右的病例中，大约82%是轻度的，15%是重度的，3%是严重的。上周五出版的《美国医学会杂志》（Journal Of the American Medical Association）的一项研究发现，1月前4周，武汉大学中南医院收治的138名患者中，26%接受了重症监护，4.3%死亡\n.\n尽管这种快速传播的传染性冠状病毒已经导致数千人重病缠身，并使医院不堪重负，但一旦研究人员了解了与该病毒相关的全部疾病谱，总的病死率很可能远低于1%，该研究所感染和免疫中心主任伊恩·利普金（Ian Lipkin）表示纽约哥伦比亚大学邮递员公共卫生学院。\n他周日对记者说，目前还没有将症状轻微或没有明显症状的人列入病例。据利普金说，过去几天报告病例增长放缓是“有意义的”，他最近从中国返回美国，为疫情提供咨询。在为期14天的家庭隔离期间，他接受了记者采访。\n他说，如果迄今为止采取的控制疫情的措施是有效的，那么应该在2月的第三或第四周观察到感染人数的“大幅减少”。他说，温暖的早春天气也可能阻碍传播。\n一些研究表明，感染者可能在14天或更长时间内不会出现症状，对病例的检测和确认会增加延误。这将延长鉴定中国前所未有的疾病控制措施是否奏效所需的时间。\n香港大学的流行病学和生物统计学负责人Benjamin Cowling星期四在墨尔本接受采访时说：“接下来的两周对了解正在发生的事情至关重要。”而且，这是否会蔓延到其他地区，或者我们是否已经避免了由于迄今已实施的控制措施而可能导致的全球流行病？”过去几天，武汉和湖北省各地报告的病例数一直在下降\n.\n世卫组织卫生紧急情况方案执行主任迈克·瑞安星期六在日内瓦对记者说：“湖北报告的病例数量已经稳定下来，我们正处于一个4天稳定期，报告的病例数量没有增加。”瑞安说，这是一个好消息，可能反映出已经实施的控制措施的影响，“湖北以外地区的感染发生率“很低，但稳定”。他说，目前还不清楚这些省份中的哪一个可能控制了这种疾病，或者在哪里可能会升级。\n瑞安说：“我们希望，武汉出现的稳定局面，也能在外部出现。”但是，现在对数字做出任何预测都非常、非常、非常早。“武汉和湖北的疫情仍然非常严重，而且几乎所有其他省份都存在很大的风险，所以我们将拭目以待，”他说。\n",

The inhibitor uses protease acting on the virus to prevent the protein from cracking, thus preventing the formation of the mature virus. \n At present, the preparation developed by the team is effective in mice infected with Sars-CoV and stable in human cell culture experiments. \n Scientists have found that the 2019-nCov is 80 per cent similar to the Sars-CoV, and the similarity between the protease of these two viruses is as high as 96 per cent. Hilgenfeld hopes that the inhibitors can help the research on 2019-nCov drugs. \n In an interview with CMG, he said that the experiments on 2019-nCov will be carried out on mice, and toxicological experiments will be carried out to eliminate other side effects that may be caused by the drugs. Finally, mass production will be possible only through clinical trials. \n The coronavirus is self-limiting.

The Directorate-General for Health is still assessing when they can be repeated for analysis.\nThe 20 citizens are distributed by Pulido Valente Hospital and Health Park (four returnees are at this facility) in Lisbon, and were visited earlier this Monday afternoon by the International Sanity Team, coordinated by the Directorate-General for Health (DGS). W\n\"There is currently no clinical evidence to report. Last night's atmosphere was quite tranquil after a long journey. From the standpoint of the general state, they're all fine. We are also making sure that aspects of comfort are improved. We know the facility isn't a hotel. There are aspects that are being completed, such as some supporting material such as books, newspapers and the Internet,\"said the Health Minister at a press conference this Monday.\nHealth Director Grace Freitas supplemented clinical information: \"None of the people have developed symptoms related to the new disease. There has been no fever, cough or respiratory symptoms.\" 20 citizens can live together as long as they wear masks and comply with the recommendations made by health professionals.\nFor the time being, the analyses carried out at the end of Sunday night, the results of which were known this Monday, were negative for the presence of the new coronavirus. But they can be repeated, although the moment at which this may happen is still under consideration.\nThe first action, she said, will be symptom observation. \"The appearance of symptoms will cause repeat analysis\nYeah. All countries are learning from this new methodology. The virus was detected less than a month ago. There are countries that are conducting analyses at 48-hour and 72-hour intervals, some with symptoms and others only when quarantine is over. We are looking at the various hypotheses almost every day and will take a decision on the basis of what we think is best and what the other partner countries are doing,\"he explained.\nGrace Freitas also said that the DGS is counting on the cooperation of a group of experts and that it will be on the basis of the recommendation of this group that they will also take a decision on when to repeat the analyses. \"We have not yet made a decision. Tomorrow [Tuesday] we will speak to the experts again and, according to the experts, we will decide the frequency of the analyses.\"\nShould one of these people show any suspicious symptoms, the protocol that already exists will be triggered. The professional contacts the medical support line for validation of the case as a suspect, there will be collection of material for analysis and the person will be referred to the reference hospital. In the face of a positive case, if close contact has taken place with another of the masked returnees, it will be necessary to resume the quarantine cycle.\nQuestioned again on the issue of isolation and measures to be applied to other citizens from China, Mrs Marta Temido reminded us that legislation allows, in exceptional situations that do not occur, separation of persons in order to ensure the health of themselves and third parties.\n\"These are exceptional measures that are always dependent on some consideration, proportionality criteria and legislation; this is not the case, but we know that there are mechanisms that we have and will use if necessary to ensure that they are themselves placed in security situations, as well as the general community,\" explained the minister\nYeah.\nGrace Freitas once again stressed that this group of citizens is special because it has been at least thirty days at the epicentre of a new disease and has therefore been treated with special measures. \"These citizens are not the same as others who may come from China. That's why the Ministry of Health decided to treat them in a special way. Others who arrive at similar risk will receive similar treatment. For different risk, different treatment\", the Director-General for Health pointed out.\nPortugal currently has three reference hospitals for suspected cases of infection with the new coronavirus and two specialised ambulances for the displacement of these cases. The delay in moving a suspect case to St John's Hospital on Felgueiras led the Union of Emergency Technicians Pre-Hospitality to make several criticisms about the material made available in the ambulances, the means available elsewhere in the country and the information available.\nGrace Freitas explained that in this first phase, whose level is of disease containment, it is necessary to have a \"very restricted first-line service line, with a well-prepared laboratory and a very capable number of professionals\". At this time he said that they were working with the National Institute of Health Dr. Ricardo Jorge (Insa) and the Regional Health Administrations already thinking of a second line of response with more laboratories, transport network and other hospitals involved.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nQuestioned as to the protocol at this time if a suspicious case appears, e.g. in the Azores or Madeira, the person responsible has indicated that the patient will be set to leave in a hospital unit in the autonomous region and if there is no laboratory capacity in the area, will be the biological sample to be sent to Lisbon for testing in the reference laboratory\nYeah. Insa President Fernando Almeida stressed that the institute works in network with other 20 national laboratories, including in the islands, and that everyone has the technology to carry out the tests.\nMarta Temido added that an assessment is ongoing of what happened with the two suspicious cases that Portugal has already registered, one in Lisbon and one in Porto. \"We already have all the time line collection and we will do a detailed internal analysis to see what went less well and evaluate measures to be taken.\"\nThe Minister added that she spoke to the INEM President this Monday about the need to reshape the information and material available to all partners working with him. And that this Tuesday there will be a meeting of the National Public Health Council to reflect on the response capacity of each entity.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The Great Helmsman swam the 16th of July 1966 in the waters of the Wuham River, accompanied by bodyguards, to show that at the age of 73 years he was in full physical form. It is considered the largest act of political propaganda in the People's Republic of China.\nThe images of the country's founding father, the historic leader of the Chinese Communist Party, the founder of Maoism, ran worldwide. Mao Tse-Tung had his summer residence in Wuham, the capital of Hunan province where he was born, in the poor village of Shaoshan, four hundred kilometres away, where even today the leader is idolized.\nThe occasion is celebrated every year, thousands of Mao worshipers enter Yangt se, but the city that bathes is no longer the same, has become the mecca of capitalism to China, torn by skyscrapers, populated by western chain stores of clothing, fast food, attended by thousands of students at one of the largest Chinese universities and cradle of production units of the major brands of the car industry, which earned her the comparison with Detroit before the decline of the American city.\nThousands of migrants live there working in the large units of General Motors, Honda, Nissan, PSA and Renault, as well as in Chinese Dongfeng (PSA partner and shareholder) and SAIC (GM partner) which employs six thousand people.\nBut it was in the traditional unhealthy market ruckus that was to be closed last year and that sells fish, shellfish and birds, but also exotic animals for human consumption from hedgehogs to live crocodiles that were identified between space salesmen and visitors with pneumonia symptoms, then reported to the Organization World Health Organization on the last day of last year\nYeah.\nA week later, already in 2020, a new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified, which quarantined the city and spread the alarm throughout Mao's cradle province, infecting the rest of the world, first with the cutting of several international air links to prevent the virus from travelling. Still, a few days after the alarm there were more than six thousand cases in all of central China, hundreds and a half of deaths, and the record of cases in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and other Asian countries, but also in Australia, the United States, South America and Europe.\n15 million people were expected to pass through Wuham during the minivacation period of the Chinese New Year- perhaps many could have gone a few miles north to the Panlongcheng archaeological site, which dates from the Shang dynasty, between 1600 and 1046 a.C. The expenses of entertainment and transportation, according to S&P Global, They should drop ten percent because of the Coronavirus.\nHistorical city\nWuhan has more inhabitants than Portugal. Nearly 11 million people live there, despite everything that is not expressive to Chinese standards: it is only the seventh most populous city in China when classified by urban population.\nBut Wuhan is of vital importance in the economic health of the country, located at the confluence of the Yangtze River and its largest tributary, the Han River, with a hundred kilometres extension, is an important communication and distribution centre for the whole of central China and also for the main economic partners. There follow the inland, air and rail transport networks which are involved in the growth of the second largest economy in the world.\nYeah.\nThe economic, political and commercial centre of the region is often called the \"Chinese Way\" and economists predict that the impact on the Chinese Gross Domestic Product of the partial quarantine imposed by the Coronavirus is at least one per cent. If the emergency does not go far beyond the commemorations of the Chinese New Year, last January's 25th, whose traditional holiday was celebrated this year in protective masks on the face or at home, as the authorities have imposed.\nIn 2019, the growth of Wuhan's GDP was 7,8 per cent, 1,7 percentage points above the national average. The total import and export value reached 244 billion yuans (about 40 billion euro), a record that was 13,7 per cent above the previous year and represented 61,9 percent of the total value of foreign trade in the province.\nMore than 300 of the 500 largest companies in the world are present in the city, including Microsoft. In recent years, Wuhan has invested to become a high-tech center, especially for the optical industry. Yet its reputation as the'car city'of China has never waned, its impact as a major logistical centre has a major influence on the economic health of China, which came to be briefly and on two occasions the capital in 1927 and again during the terrible Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937.\nBut by the 1911 Wuham had marked the history of that great country, when it was the stage of the Wuchang uprising, which overthrew the last imperial dynasty. Fifteen years later, the troops led by Chiang Kai-shek conquered the city, giving breath to control of the territory by the alliance between their Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party, which already comprised the entire southeast of the country.\nBut Wuhan was also a symbol of the division between the KMT and the Communists.\nYeah. The war with Japan, which invaded China as part of its expansionist plans even before World War II, put an end to Chiang Kai-shek's attempts to unify the country. Before the Japanese advance, the KMT government was forced to abandon the capital, Nanjing, retreating to Wuhan and then to the remote town of Chongqing.\nIn July of 1967, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, there was a so-called Wuhan incident: an armed conflict between two groups fighting for control of the city. The two opposing forces were the \"Million Heroes\" and the \"General Headquarters of the Wuhan Workers\".\nThe first included 500 thousand people, mainly skilled workers, civil servants and the party, and was supported by the commander of Wuhan Military Region, General Chen Zaidao. The General Headquarters, with many other supporters, was composed of workers and students from the Red Guard. They engaged in a propaganda war to gain support from the local community -Mao was president of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and had already swam in the waters of Yangth.\nTwelve days later, the 28 of July 1966, representatives of the Red Guard wrote to Mao, claiming rebellion and rebellion to carry out the Cultural Revolution. Many people accused of being counter-revolutionary were forced to commit suicide.\nDuring 1966's'red August', 1772 were killed only in Beijing. In Shanghai, there were 704 suicides and 534 deaths related to the Cultural Revolution in September. In Wuhan there were 62 suicides and 32 murders. The Wuhan incident was considered crucial in the evolution of the so-called Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.\n",

The “n” in the term stands for novel while “CoV” refers to the coronavirus. \n The 2019-nCov belongs to a larger family of viruses found in both animals and humans. Some of these viruses infect people and are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe respiratory diseases. \n \"The danger when you don't have an official name is that people start using terms like China Virus, and that can create a backlash against certain populations,” Dr Watson said, adding that social media helps unofficial names to take hold quickly. \n WHO guidelines on naming new human infectious diseases stipulate that the name should not include geographic locations such as cities, countries, regions or continents. \n The organisation cited Middle East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS), the Spanish flu and Japanese encephalitis as examples to be avoided. \n Disease names should also avoid people’s names, species or classes of animals or food, terms that incite undue fear as well as cultural, population, industry or occupational references. \n The guidelines also suggest that diseases names can include generic descriptive terms of symptoms, as well as specific descriptive terms such as age groups, time course, severity, seasonality and environment. \n  \n A professor of virology who sits on the ICTV study group that has been deciding on the new name told the BBC that the team began discussing the issue about two weeks ago. They are now submitting the name to a scientific journal for publication and hope to announce it within days. \n Chair of Biological Sciences at Texas A&M University-Texarkana in the United States said that the new name has to “roll off the tongue” more easily that the other currently used terms. \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE: Like many others on the frontline during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic in 2003, the resources of a family clinic in Choa Chu Kang had been stretched thin. \n Personal protective equipment - N95 respirators, sterile gloves and full-body gowns - was scarce at a time when the world had never seen a virus like it, and people everywhere were desperately scrambling to stockpile emergency supplies for themselves. \n Dr Tan Tze Lee, a general practitioner at the Edinburgh Clinic, recalled the difficulties that frontline healthcare workers faced when procuring equipment to protect themselves from the killer virus. \n By the time SARS was contained in May 2003, it had infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Two in five of those infected had been healthcare workers. \n While Dr Tan’s clinic thankfully encountered no cases, it remained on high alert for SARS patients in the four months of the epidemic in Singapore, throughout which the medical staff had to don full protective gear. But everyone was not ready for the crisis, said Dr Tan, who is also president of the College of Family Physicians Singapore. \n Many continued to work but were extremely concerned that they might bring the virus home and put their loved ones at risk, he added. \n “The healthcare practitioners in Singapore were ill-prepared, which resulted in sombre outcomes. Since then, we have learnt our lesson and measures were instituted to prepare us for any future pandemic event.” \n “Here we are today, ready to fight the 2019-nCoV,” he said. \n The current outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus - or 2019-nCoV, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) temporary name for the virus - was first confirmed in Singapore on Jan 23. To date, all cases were imported, including a Singaporean who was in Wuhan, and there has been no evidence of community spread in the Republic. \n The WHO has yet to declare the virus - which has spread to several countries - as a pandemic. Nevertheless, it was declared a global health emergency on Friday (Jan 31). \n The first cases were reported in Wuhan in China’s Hubei province and believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells live animals. \n At the heart of Singapore's response plan is the Disease Outbreak Response System (DORS), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after SARS and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (or H1N1) pandemic in 2009. \n  \n “After SARS, we made a thorough review of the facilities we had – the infrastructure, hospitals, isolation wards, and the scientific testing and capabilities,” said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week. \n “I think we are much better prepared now.” \n Currently, Singapore is at DORS condition (DORSCON) Yellow, signifying that the virus is severe and can infect from person to person, but is chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The next step up is DORSCON Orange, which would have applied in the case of SARS, whereby the virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. \n While the plans are in place and some measures have kicked in, Singapore’s national strategy is still largely untested - since the Wuhan coronavirus is believed to be in its early stages in the Republic, medical experts and SARS veterans said. \n However, there are ample signs that the lessons from SARS are being applied as Singapore shores up its defences, they said. They believe that unlike during SARS, Singapore is far more ready now. \n LESSONS LEARNT \n Singapore has had two brushes with pandemics in recent memory - SARS and H1N1. \n While Singapore was able to contain and recover from both, the varying nature of the viruses, as well as the changes in medical science, meant that dealing with each required different approaches. \n Doctors had limited options when treating SARS patients and could only administer supportive care, and there was nothing that could be done to prevent infection. In comparison, vaccines and treatment options were available when H1N1 claimed 18 lives in Singapore and infected more than 400,000 people, out of which about 1,300 had to be hospitalised. \n COMMAND AND CONTROL \n SARS first arrived in Singapore in late February 2003, and was detected in a woman with an atypical pneumonia on March 1, 2003 at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). At the time, no one knew how deadly and virulent it was and the first patient led to a cluster of 42 cases at the hospital. \n A Ministry of Health (MOH) taskforce was set up on Mar 15, two weeks after the mysterious strain appeared in Singapore and three days after the WHO issued a global alert on the outbreak that began in Hong Kong. \n But the command and control structure then was “wholly inadequate” in a crisis situation that was both fluid and unprecedented, a study in the Austrian Journal of South-east Asian Studies concluded in 2012. \n  \n The structure was led by the health authorities, when in hindsight, it required “more than a medical approach since resources had to be drawn from a number of government agencies that did not fall under the rubric of the MOH”, said authors Allen Lai and Tan Teck Boon, who were from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. \n They noted that it took five weeks after the first case was reported for the bureaucracy to adapt, though by then, the outbreak had already spread quickly out of TTSH. \n On April 7, 2003, a national control structure was created in response to SARS, comprising a nine-member inter-ministerial committee led by then Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng to provide strategic and political directions during health crises. \n Helping to coordinate across silos were a core executive group of senior civil servants, and an operations committee spanning ministries. Their functions were later consolidated during the H1N1 crisis, which meant that this leaner bureaucracy was quicker to respond to emerging situations on the ground. \n With the Wuhan coronavirus, observers said that it was evident that the Government had reacted more quickly than in SARS and H1N1 when it came to establishing a multi-disciplinary decision-making body. \n Professor Ooi Eng Eong, an infectious diseases expert and virologist at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, noted that a multi-ministry taskforce on the Wuhan coronavirus was formed on Jan 22, several hours before the first suspected case came to the attention of the authorities at 10pm the same day. The patient - a 66-year-old Chinese national tourist from Wuhan - tested positive the next day, becoming the first confirmed case in Singapore. \n “If you look at the response time, it is a fact that the ministerial committee formed before the case appeared, and we can see that a lot of systems are already in place, occurring across ministries and not as siloed as back then when SARS caught us all by surprise,” said Prof Ooi, who is also deputy director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme at Duke-NUS Medical School. \n The taskforce was formed to direct the whole-of-government response to the outbreak, coordinate the public’s response and work with the international community. \n Jointly chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, the taskforce comprises a cross-section of Cabinet ministers spanning various portfolios. They are: \n Dr Chia Shi-Lu, a Tanjong Pagar GRC Member of Parliament who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, said that this time, the chain of command is clearer. \n He noted that even before the taskforce was formed, the MOH had already begun tracking the outbreak in China at the start of the year. Temperature screening measures were put in place at Changi Airport from as early as Jan 3. \n But the high political signature of the panel had led some to question whether too many cooks were spoiling the broth, Dr Chia noted. “In fact, some have asked me: Are we overdoing it?” he said. \n “I believe it is very important for everybody to come into the picture - you have to, because at this early stage, (the outbreak) affects so many different parts and you need leadership from them, and you cannot rely solely on MOH to coordinate everything,” he added. \n  \n INFRASTRUCTURE, CASE MANAGEMENT AND ISOLATION \n While information about the Wuhan virus is still emerging, Singapore is not in the same position as in the initial stages of the SARS outbreak in 2003, where it was - in the words of then Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang - “flying blind”. \n During the SARS crisis, Singapore only had two means to detect those infected with the virus: Their clinical symptoms and their travel history. Detecting these were not easy at the time as temperature screeners were also a rare resource, unlike today. \n “We have to depend on people taking temperature, and we have to depend on people being truthful to us in their contact history,” said Mr Lim then, describing SARS as a tremendous challenge. \n Dr Tan Yia Swam, First Vice-President of the Singapore Medical Association (SMA), said that in the SARS crisis, “there were too many unknowns, and precautions came too late, and too slowly”. SARS was zoonotic in nature, with the disease starting in animals before spreading to humans. \n As a result, policies and procedures regarding risk stratification, contact mapping, contact tracing, quarantine and others were developed on the fly as the epidemic erupted, she said. \n “Today, all of the above have been developed and tested before in exercises and they are now put into action. Of course, these plans, policies and procedures must be modified in line with the epidemiology of the disease, but we are not working from scratch, unlike the past experience with SARS,” she added. \n  \n Addressing the media on Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong said that in the taskforce’s national response to the virus, it is able to “marshal all available resources” to tackle the scourge. \n In terms of capacity, Singapore has already beefed up its healthcare and isolation capacity since 2003. This includes the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases that opened last year, and new hospitals such as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in 2010, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital in 2015, and Sengkang General Hospital in 2018, he said. \n During SARS, TTSH was known as “SARSCentral”, the designated hospital to handle patients. This was borne out of a policy to restrict transmission of the virus to other hospitals, after a patient - who was unaware that he had been infected with the virus during his stay in TTSH - created a new viral cluster at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) when he went there for a surgical problem after his discharge from TTSH. \n This policy changed in 2009 during the H1N1 outbreak, with the Health Ministry imposing a standardised infection control measure on all healthcare facilities, empowered by timely tweaks to the Infectious Diseases Act. More than 400 family clinics were made “H1N1-ready” and equipped with the Tamiflu vaccine to handle the outbreak. \n  \n Similarly, all public hospitals are capable of handling the Wuhan virus today, and come equipped with isolation rooms, which were in short supply in 2003. \n When it came to medical supplies, Dr Chia recalled how there was hardly a stockpile of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers then, such as N95 respirators. \n “Because an N95 mask needs to fit well for it to perform its function, having a properly fitted mask was (hard to come by) during SARS, and we had to find time to do the fitting too,” said Dr Chia, who was an orthopaedic surgeon at SGH at the height of the crisis. \n “Today, most of us are already fitted with our own personal equipment, even as new staff. Everything is in place today,” he said. \n  \n For the general public, the Government will be disbursing a pack of four surgical masks to each of the 1.37 million Singapore households in a one-off exercise between Feb 1 and Feb 9. This was also done in 2003 when all households received a free emergency kit, containing N95 masks and themometers. \n This time round, the mask distribution comes amid long queues at pharmacies around the island as people clamour to buy masks, and retailers say their stocks of surgical masks and N95 masks are running low or sold out. The Government had released 5 million masks from its stockpile over nine days to the retailers but they were all snapped up in hours. \n Said Dr Chia: “The message is that there is enough for the whole of the population and in reserve too.” \n SMA’s Dr Tan said his association met with the College of Family Physicians Singapore over the Chinese New Year weekend to carry out “complex logistics arrangements” to ensure that there is a steady supply of surgical and N95 masks to replenish stocks for the frontline healthcare workers. \n “We are all monitoring the situation closely, and are ready to step up efforts when the need arises,” he said. \n Experts noted that contingency plans have been put in place too - student hostels are converted into quarantine facilities in anticipation of future cases, and the Outward Bound Singapore on Pulau Ubin has been marked as a possible quarantine site. \n  \n TRICKY BALANCE IN THE FACE OF IMPONDERABLES \n On Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong also called on Singaporeans to be psychologically prepared that the Wuhan virus could be worse than SARS given the many “imponderables” and “uncertainties” regarding the infection, though he stressed that there is still no evidence of community spread of the disease in Singapore. \n Over the past week, however, the first reports of human-to-human transmissions outside of China have surfaced in Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Germany. \n Mr Lawrence Wong said Singapore’s approach “is to anticipate and move as swiftly as we can”. “But every action we take really has to be based on evidence, data and international medical guidelines,” he added. \n  \n Unlike SARS, which impacted Singapore when little was known about it, there is now a greater understanding about the coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the Wuhan strain and SARS. \n But data gaps still exist, said Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the WHO’s research policy and cooperation department in Geneva. \n Prof Pangestu said that not much is known of the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus the severe and fatal ones, which currently makes it difficult to evaluate the Wuhan virus’ true epidemic potential and complicates the outbreak response. \n There is also the worry that the virus could mutate into a more virulent and more highly transmissible strain. “This needs close monitoring and another data gap will be in how quickly this development can be evaluated,” he said. \n Despite these gaps, Singapore has “reacted much more swiftly and comprehensively” than in 2003, Prof Pangestu added. \n  \n A rule of thumb for any country’s approach in health crises, he said, is to base decisions on scientific evidence and rational analysis in the context of its own capacities. \n “I think the Singapore approach is the correct one given the current information and evidence available - robust but not over-reactive and flexible enough to accommodate new developments,” said Prof Pangestu. \n He noted that overreaction risks imposing an unjustifiable burden on the country, potentially impacting normal daily routines and the livelihoods of certain vulnerable segments of the population. Under-reaction, on the other hand, would lead to a more extensive spread of the virus. \n “Calibrating the balance is tricky, but as I said, base your decisions on the existing scientific evidence,” said Prof Pangestu. \n Prof Ooi from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health added: “There is a risk and cost to overreaction and a cost to an under-reaction. Nobody knows what is the right answer and there is no hard science to it - this is a judgement call and there is no right or wrong.” \n Where there is a dearth of knowledge on imported pandemic cases, Singapore’s national strategy is flexible with the changing circumstances, and the plan recommends taking border control measures that would “err on the side of caution with more intense efforts until such time when the disease profile becomes clearer”. \n Addressing the media on Friday, Mr Lee said: “I think as a Government, in a way, we are overreacting because we are trying to look ahead to see what can go wrong and take preemptive steps to prevent that from happening.” \n Within a week, the taskforce moved from allowing travellers from Wuhan to enter Singapore while subject to enhanced screening on Monday, to imposing a complete entry ban on all nationalities who have been to China in the past 14 days on Friday. \n The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority has also stopped issuing all forms of new visas to those with People’s Republic of China passports. \n HANDLING A PSYCHOLOGICAL CRISIS \n Although the memory of SARS may have faded for some, experts say that the psychological lessons from it have remained until today, such that more Singaporeans are aware of the need to cooperate with the authorities during a health crisis. \n For example, social media is rife with examples of Singaporeans calling out bad actors, such as online sellers who hoard surgical masks to resell, or profiteering behaviour by certain businesses. The Government has also acted quickly to combat such behaviour. But Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, believes that the SARS legacy can also be a double-edged sword: The prospect of another SARS-like epidemic might lead to needless panic, or worse, “kiasuism”. \n  \n In a viral outbreak, being  “kiasu” means that people only think for themselves, preventing mutual cooperation from happening, he said. \n Urging Singaporeans to do better, Dr Leong said they should be prepared for the viral outbreak but not overdo it. If fear and panic take hold, they can overwhelm the country’s response “like a tsunami”, he said. \n This means Singapore’s national response has to preemptively address concerns that could lead to panic, he said. \n “You have no time to get ready. Better to be ready (for the worst) now than not ready at all … There is little room for mistakes (that create more panic),” said Dr Leong. \n  \n Dr Chia believes that Singaporeans are generally behaving in a rational way so far, based on his conversations with residents as an MP or his interactions with patients. \n “During SARS, there was a lot more fear and a sense of real danger for everyone. We had people trying to evade quarantine, refusing to cooperate or going for medical screening … But so far there are no cases of people who are trying to evade authorities, in other countries, yes, but not among Singaporeans,” he said. \n The rise of social media, which was non-existent during SARS , can also give rise to disinformation that fuels further panic. \n On the threat of fake news, SMA’s Dr Tan said: “Social media may do more harm than good in this kind of situation where fake news may spread faster than a virus and trigger unwanted behaviours. We urge all readers to exercise judgement when reading stories from various sources, and to keep referencing to official websites for accurate information.” \n STRONGER LEGISLATION \n Compared with the SARS crisis, Singapore has more legislative levers now to deal with fake news and anti-social behaviour - the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act being one of them. \n Lesser known are the many enhancements to the Infectious Diseases Act over the years since 2003, which give the authorities greater powers to enforce orders that were issued in the fight against a gazetted outbreak. \n The Act allows people who break home quarantine orders to be arrested without a warrant and to be jailed or fined on conviction. It was amended last year to allow officers to use “physical means” to enforce the order by bringing an absconder back to the place of isolation, in lieu of arrest. \n It also makes explicit that persons under legal orders that restrict their movement in Singapore, would not be allowed to leave the country, unless otherwise permitted. \n The breadth of such powers in Singapore gives the authorities the ability to ensure that evasion tactics, such as those described by Dr Chia, cannot happen again. The issue became such a problem during the SARS crisis that the health authorities had to resort to draconian measures, such as installing video surveillance cameras in the homes of people who were ordered to be quarantined. \n The lack of legal powers has created some difficulties for several foreign governments in dealing with the Wuhan coronavirus. Earlier this week, two Japanese citizens who were brought back to Japan from Wuhan on a chartered flight declined to go for medical screening when they landed in Tokyo. \n Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the Japanese Parliament: \"While quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so.\" \n MORAL SUASION AND IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC COMMS \n But over the longer term, evidence suggests that government measures such as quarantine and travel restrictions are not as effective as instilling a voluntary sense of social etiquette and responsibility among the people. \n Having a buy-in from the public is especially essential when the authorities need the people’s support to carry out certain measures, noted Prof Pangestu. \n  \n Prof Pangestu said: “You need the public’s cooperation for your measures to be successful, such as to follow good hygiene practices, be alert to any symptoms, promptly seeking healthcare, awareness of potential risks, and to counter the spread of misinformation on social media.” \n This will be critical during the “surge response” - when situational changes cause a sudden need for the authorities to ramp up its measures, such as activating quarantine sites that are being held in reserve. \n A lack of moral suasion would erase the ability for the Government to implement these measures, experts said. They noted how in Hong Kong, protesters bombed a general hospital and a residential building that the authorities had wanted to use as a possible quarantine facility. \n Over the past week, South Korean protesters - mostly residents - also used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centres in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, which are about 80km from Seoul. \n Experts said cooperation from the masses largely relies on public education as well as proper and accurate communication of risk, which is not always a guarantee considering the complex flow of information in a crisis situation that can lead to miscommunication. \n An April 2003 article in The Straits Times, \"All the right moves for SARSbut info’s a bit slow, no?\", by its then news editor Bertha Henson, described how the MOH was asked at a press conference to confirm a tipoff that SGH nurses might have SARS. The authorities said no, but it later emerged the next day that 21 SGH staff were on the SARS suspect list. \n “The kindest thing I can say about this sudden announcement is that the ministry gets its information later than the media,” wrote Ms Henson then. \n Referring to the incident, Professor Chee Yam Cheng, the current president of the Singapore Medical Council, wrote in a series of memos about SARS in 2003 that “quick dissemination of information - and accurate information - is almost as important as transparency in a health emergency”. \n Prof Pangestu believes that in general, Singaporeans are united and support what the Government is trying to do to contain the situation. \n “But public reaction is hard to control especially with fake news on social media. The idea that ‘perception is reality, anything is the truth’ often operates in this kind of (crisis) environment. That is why public risk communication is so important,” he said. \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "新加坡：与2003年非典（严重急性呼吸系统综合征）流行期间前线的许多其他人一样，蔡楚康（Choa Chu Kang）一家家庭诊所的资源已经捉襟见肘。\n个人防护装备——N95呼吸机、无菌手套和全身长袍——在世界上从来没有见过这种病毒的时候是稀缺的，世界各地的人们都在拼命地为自己储备应急物资。\n爱丁堡诊所的全科医生Tan Tze Lee博士回忆说，一线医护人员在采购设备以保护自己免受致命病毒感染时面临的困难。\n到2003年5月非典得到控制时，新加坡已有238人感染，33人死亡。五分之二的感染者是医护人员。\n虽然谭医生的诊所幸好没有遇到病例，但在新加坡疫情爆发的四个月里，它对SARS患者保持高度警惕，医护人员在这四个月里必须全副防护装备。但同时兼任新加坡家庭医生学院院长的谭博士说，每个人都没有做好应对危机的准备。\n他补充说，许多人继续工作，但极为担心他们可能会把病毒带回家，使他们的亲人处于危险之中。\n“新加坡的医疗从业人员准备不足，导致了惨淡的结果。从那时起，我们吸取了教训，并制定了措施，为今后的任何大流行事件做好准备。”\n他说：“我们今天就在这里，准备与2019年的nCoV战斗。\n1月23日，世界卫生组织（世卫组织）对武汉冠状病毒（即2019年nCoV）的临时名称）在新加坡首次得到确认。到目前为止，所有的病例都是进口的，包括一名在武汉的新加坡人，而且没有证据表明社区在共和国蔓延\n.\n世卫组织尚未宣布该病毒（已扩散到几个国家）为大流行。尽管如此，它在周五（1月31日）被宣布为全球卫生紧急事件。\n首批病例在中国湖北省武汉市报告，据信与出售活动物的华南海鲜批发市场有关。\n新加坡应对计划的核心是“疾病爆发应对系统”（DORS），该危机管理计划在2003不存在，但在SARS之后起草并在2009猪流感（或H1N1）大流行之后再次完善。\n李显龙总理上周在瑞士达沃斯出席世界经济论坛期间说：“非典之后，我们对我们拥有的设施进行了彻底的评估，包括基础设施、医院、隔离病房、科学测试和能力。”。\n“我想我们现在准备得好多了。”\n目前，新加坡正处于多尔松状态（DORSCON）黄色，表明该病毒严重，可在人与人之间传染，但主要发生在新加坡以外地区。下一步是多尔森奥兰治（DORSCON Orange），它本可以应用于非典型肺炎（SARS）病例中，病毒在新加坡传播，但传播范围不广，目前正在得到控制。\n医学专家和非典退伍军人说，虽然计划已经出台，一些措施已经启动，但新加坡的国家战略基本上还没有得到检验——因为据信武汉冠状病毒在共和国尚处于早期阶段。\n不过，他们表示，有充分迹象表明，随着新加坡加强防御，非典的教训正在得到应用。他们认为，与非典时期不同的是，新加坡现在准备得更充分了。\n吸取的教训\n在最近的记忆中，新加坡经历了两次大流行——非典和H1N1。\n虽然新加坡能够控制和恢复这两种病毒，但病毒的不同性质以及医学的变化意味着处理每一种病毒需要不同的方法\n.\n医生在治疗非典型肺炎病人时有有限的选择，只能实施支持性护理，而且没有任何办法可以预防感染。相比之下，当H1N1在新加坡夺去了18条生命，感染了40多万人时，疫苗和治疗方案是可用的，其中约1300人必须住院治疗。\n指挥和控制\n非典型肺炎于2003年2月底首次抵达新加坡，并于2003年3月1日在谭托克生医院（TTSH）发现一名患有非典型肺炎的妇女。当时，没有人知道它的致命性和毒性，第一个病人在医院里导致了42个病例的聚集。\n卫生部（卫生部）在马尔15日成立，两周前，新加坡发生了神秘的毒株，世卫组织发布了对香港爆发疫情的全球预警三天。\n但《奥地利东南亚研究杂志》（Austrian Journal of South east Asian Studies）2012年发表的一份研究报告称，当时的指挥和控制结构在一个变化无常、史无前例的危机形势下“完全不够”。\n该结构由卫生当局领导，但事后看来，它要求“不仅仅是一种医疗方法，因为资源必须从一些不属于卫生部职权范围的政府机构中提取”，作者Allen Lai和Tan Teck Boon说，他们来自李光耀公共政策学院。\n他们指出，在第一个病例被报告后，官僚机构花了五个星期才适应，不过到那时，疫情已经很快从TTSH蔓延出去。\n2003年4月7日，为应对非典，成立了一个由9名成员组成的部际委员会，由时任内政部长黄侃生领导，在卫生危机期间提供战略和政治指导。\n帮助跨部门协调是一个由高级公务员组成的核心执行小组，以及一个跨部门的业务委员会\n. 他们的职能后来在H1N1流感危机期间得到巩固，这意味着这种精简的官僚机构能够更快地应对当地出现的新情况。\n对于武汉冠状病毒，观察人士表示，很明显，在建立多学科决策机构方面，政府的反应比非典和H1N1更为迅速。\n索斯威霍克公共卫生学院传染病专家和病毒学家吴英昂教授指出，武汉冠状病毒多部门工作组于1月22日成立，几个小时后，第一例疑似病例于当天晚上10点提请当局注意。这名患者是一名来自武汉的66岁中国游客，第二天检测呈阳性，成为新加坡首例确诊病例。\n欧教授说：“如果你看看反应时间，事实上，在这起案件出现之前，部长委员会就已经成立了，我们可以看到，很多制度已经到位，发生在各个部委之间，不像当年非典让我们大吃一惊时那样孤立。”，世卫组织还担任杜克国立大学医学院新兴传染病方案副主任。\n该工作组的成立是为了指导政府应对疫情的整个行动，协调公众的反应，并与国际社会合作。\n该工作组由卫生部长甘金勇和国家发展部部长王立军共同主持，由内阁各部部长组成。他们是：\n担任政府议会卫生委员会主席的丹戎帕加尔GRC议员Chia Shi Lu博士说，这一次，指挥系统更加清晰。\n他指出，甚至在特遣部队成立之前，卫生部就已经开始跟踪中国今年年初的疫情。樟宜机场早在1月3日就已采取了降温措施\n.\n但Chia博士指出，专家组的高度政治性特征导致一些人质疑是否有太多的厨师在破坏肉汤。“事实上，有人问我：我们做得过火了吗？他说。\n他补充说：“我认为，每个人都要参与进来，这一点非常重要——你必须这样做，因为在这个早期阶段，（疫情爆发）影响到这么多不同的部分，你需要他们的领导，你不能仅仅依靠卫生部来协调一切。”。\n基础设施、案例管理和隔离\n虽然有关武汉病毒的信息仍在不断涌现，但新加坡与2003年非典爆发初期的情况并不相同，用当时的卫生部长林荣江的话说，当时的情况是“盲目飞行”。\n在非典危机期间，新加坡只有两种方法来检测感染者：他们的临床症状和旅行史。检测这些在当时并不容易，因为温度筛选机也是一种罕见的资源，不像今天。\n“我们必须依赖于人们的体温，我们必须依赖于人们在他们的接触史上对我们诚实，”当时林先生说，他形容非典是一个巨大的挑战。\n新加坡医学会（SMA）第一副会长谭耀泳博士说，在非典危机中，“未知数太多，预防措施来得太晚、太慢”。SARS在自然界是人畜共患的疾病，这种疾病在动物身上开始传播，然后传播到人类身上。\n她说，因此，随着疫情的爆发，有关风险分层、接触图绘制、接触者追踪、检疫等方面的政策和程序正在迅速发展。\n“今天，上述各项以前都是在演习中开发和试验的，现在已经付诸实施。当然，这些计划、政策和程序必须根据该病的流行病学进行修改，但我们并没有白手起家，这与过去非典的经验不同，”她补充说\n.\n周一，劳伦斯•黄在接受媒体采访时表示，在工作组对病毒的全国性反应中，它能够“调动所有可用资源”来对付这一祸害。\n在能力方面，新加坡自2003年以来已经加强了医疗和隔离能力。他说，这包括去年开放的有330张床位的国家传染病中心，以及2010年的霍德培医院、2015年的吴登芳总医院和2018年的盛港总医院等新医院。\n在SARS期间，TTSH被称为“SARSCentral”，是处理病人的指定医院。这是由于一项限制将病毒传播到其他医院的政策所证实的，此前，一名患者在新加坡综合医院（SGH）出院后前往那里接受外科手术时，不知道自己在TTSH期间感染了病毒，在新加坡综合医院创建了一个新的病毒群。\n这项政策在2009年H1N1疫情期间发生了变化，卫生部通过及时调整《传染病法》，对所有医疗设施实施了标准化的感染控制措施。400多家家庭诊所已经准备好了H1N1病毒，并配备了达菲疫苗来应对疫情。\n同样，所有公立医院都有能力处理武汉病毒，并配备隔离室，这些隔离室在2003年供不应求。\n谈到医疗用品，Chia博士回忆说，当时几乎没有为医护人员储备N95呼吸机等个人防护装备。\n“因为N95口罩需要很好的配合才能发挥其功能，所以在非典期间（很难买到）有一个合适的口罩，我们也必须找时间来做这个配合，”处于危机最严重时期的新加坡国立卫生院骨科医生Chia博士说。\n“今天，我们大多数人已经配备了自己的个人设备，即使是新员工\n. 今天一切都准备好了。”。\n政府将在2月1日至2月9日的一次性演习中，向137万新加坡家庭每人发放一包4个口罩。2003年，所有家庭都得到了一个免费的急救箱，里面有N95口罩和温度计。\n这一次，由于人们叫嚣着要购买口罩，岛上各地药店排起了长队，口罩分发工作正在进行中，零售商说，他们的外科口罩和N95口罩库存正在减少或售罄。政府在9天内从库存中向零售商发放了500万个口罩，但这些口罩都在数小时内被抢购一空。\nChia博士说：“这个信息是，这里有足够的人口，也有足够的储备。”\nSMA的谭博士说，协会在春节周末与新加坡家庭医生学院会面，进行“复杂的后勤安排”，以确保外科和N95口罩的稳定供应，为一线医护人员补充库存。\n他说：“我们都在密切关注局势，并准备在需要时加大努力。”。\n专家们注意到，应急计划也已经到位——学生宿舍被改造成隔离设施，以防将来发生病例，位于普兰岛的新加坡出境游也被标记为可能的隔离地点。\n面对无法估量的事物时的微妙平衡\n周一，王永明还呼吁新加坡人做好心理准备，考虑到在感染方面存在许多“无法估量”和“不确定因素”，武汉病毒可能会比非典更严重，不过他强调，目前仍没有证据显示这种疾病在新加坡社区传播。\n然而，在过去的一周里，在中国以外的台湾、日本、越南和德国出现了第一批人与人之间传播的报告\n.\n劳伦斯•黄表示，新加坡的做法“是尽可能快地预见并采取行动”。他补充说：“但我们采取的每一项行动都必须以证据、数据和国际医疗准则为基础。”。\n与非典不同，非典在鲜为人知的情况下影响了新加坡，现在人们对冠状病毒有了更深入的了解，冠状病毒是一个包括武汉株和非典在内的病毒家族。\n但是，李光耀公共政策学院的访问研究员Tikki Elka Pangestu教授和日内瓦世界卫生组织的研究政策和合作部门的前主任说，数据差距仍然存在。\n彭士图教授说，目前对轻症和无症状病例与重症和致命病例的比例知之甚少，这使得目前难以评估武汉病毒的真正流行潜力，并使疫情应对复杂化。\n人们还担心，这种病毒可能变异成一种毒性更强、传播能力更强的病毒株。他说：“这需要密切监控，另一个数据缺口将是评估这一发展的速度。”。\n尽管存在这些差距，但与2003年相比，新加坡的反应“更加迅速和全面”。\n他说，任何国家应对健康危机的方法的经验法则，都是以科学证据和自身能力范围内的理性分析为基础做出决定。\n“我认为新加坡的方法是正确的，考虑到现有的信息和证据-稳健的，但不是过度反应和灵活，足以适应新的发展，”Prof Pangestu说。\n他指出，过度反应有可能给国家带来不合理的负担，可能影响正常的日常生活和某些弱势群体的生计。另一方面，反应不足会导致病毒更广泛的传播\n.\n“校准平衡是棘手的，但正如我所说，把你的决定现有的科学证据，”Prof Pangestu说。\nSaw-Swee Hock公共卫生学院的Ooi教授补充道：“过度反应有风险和成本，反应不足也有成本。没有人知道什么是正确的答案，也没有难懂的科学——这是一个判断的召唤，没有对错之分。”\n在对进口大流行病例缺乏了解的情况下，新加坡的国家战略在不断变化的情况下是灵活的，并且该计划建议采取边境控制措施，“在疾病轮廓变得更清楚的时候，”在更为强烈的努力下“谨慎行事”。\n李明博周五在接受媒体采访时表示：“我认为，作为一个政府，在某种程度上，我们反应过度，因为我们正试图向前看，看看会出现什么问题，并采取先发制人的措施，防止这种情况发生。”\n在一周内，特别工作组从允许武汉的旅客在周一接受强化检查的同时进入新加坡，改为在周五对过去14天来中国的所有国籍实施全面入境禁令。\n移民和检查站管理局还停止向持有中华人民共和国护照的人发放各种形式的新签证。\n处理心理危机\n虽然对一些人来说，非典的记忆可能已经褪去，但专家说，从非典中汲取的心理教训一直延续到今天，因此，更多的新加坡人意识到在健康危机期间需要与当局合作。\n例如，社交媒体上充斥着新加坡人叫嚣不良行为者的例子，比如网上卖家囤积外科口罩转售，或者某些企业牟取暴利的行为。政府也迅速采取行动打击这种行为\n不过，伊丽莎白诺夫纳山医院传染病专家梁浩南博士认为，非典的后遗症也可能是一把双刃剑：另一场类似非典的疫情可能会导致不必要的恐慌，或者更糟的是“克钦独立主义”。\n他说，在病毒爆发时，成为“kiasu”意味着人们只为自己着想，阻止了相互合作的发生。\n梁振英博士敦促新加坡人做得更好，他说，他们应该为病毒爆发做好准备，但不能做得过火。他说，如果恐惧和恐慌占据了上风，它们会“像海啸一样”压倒国家的反应。\n他说，这意味着新加坡的国家应对措施必须先发制人地解决可能导致恐慌的担忧。\n“你没有时间准备。梁振英博士说：“现在最好做好准备（最坏的情况下），而不是一点都不准备……犯错误（造成更多恐慌）的空间很小。”。\nChia博士认为，根据他作为议员与居民的对话或与病人的互动，到目前为止，新加坡人的行为总体上是理性的。\n“非典期间，每个人都有更多的恐惧和真正的危险感。我们曾有人试图逃避检疫，拒绝合作或去做医学检查……但到目前为止，还没有人试图逃避当局，在其他国家，是的，但在新加坡人中没有。”。\n社交媒体的兴起，在SARS期间是不存在的，也会引起虚假信息，从而进一步加剧恐慌。\n关于假新闻的威胁，SMA的谭博士说：“在这种假新闻传播速度可能超过病毒并引发不必要行为的情况下，社交媒体可能弊大于利。我们敦促所有读者在阅读来自不同来源的报道时，要有判断力，并不断参考官方网站以获取准确的信息\n.”\n加强立法\n与非典危机相比，新加坡现在有更多的立法手段来处理假新闻和反社会行为——网络虚假和操纵行为的保护就是其中之一。\n鲜为人知的是自2003年以来对《传染病法》的许多改进，这些改进赋予了当局更大的权力，以执行在与一次已公布的疫情作斗争时发布的命令。\n该法允许违反家庭隔离令的人在没有逮捕令的情况下被逮捕，并在定罪后被监禁或罚款。去年修改后，允许警员使用“物理手段”执行命令，将潜逃者带回隔离地点，代替逮捕。\n它还明确规定，除非另有许可，否则根据限制其在新加坡流动的法律命令的人不得离开新加坡。\n新加坡这种权力的广度，使当局有能力确保类似Chia博士所描述的规避策略不会再次发生。在非典危机期间，这个问题变得如此严重，以至于卫生当局不得不采取严厉的措施，例如在被下令隔离的人的家中安装视频监控摄像机。\n由于缺乏法律权力，一些外国政府在处理武汉冠状病毒方面遇到了一些困难。本周早些时候，两名乘坐包机从武汉带回日本的日本公民在东京降落时拒绝接受体检。\n首相安倍晋三对日本国会说：“虽然检疫官员尽力劝说他们去做进一步的检查，但他们拒绝了，不幸的是，没有法律依据迫使他们这样做。”\n.\"\n道德劝诫与公共传播的重要性\n但从长期来看，有证据表明，政府采取的隔离和旅行限制等措施，不如在民众中灌输一种自愿的社会礼仪和责任感那么有效。\n当当局需要人民的支持来执行某些措施时，让公众的支持尤其重要，潘基斯托教授指出。\n潘基斯托教授说：“你需要公众的合作，才能使你的措施取得成功，比如遵循良好的卫生习惯，警惕任何症状，迅速寻求医疗保健，意识到潜在的风险，并阻止错误信息在社交媒体上的传播。”\n这将在“激增反应”期间至关重要——当情况变化导致当局突然需要加强其措施时，例如激活被保留的检疫点。\n专家表示，缺乏道德劝说将抹去政府执行这些措施的能力。他们指出，在香港，抗议者轰炸了一家综合医院和一幢住宅楼，当局希望以此作为可能的检疫设施。\n在过去的一周里，韩国抗议者——大部分是当地居民——还使用拖拉机，阻止他们进入距离首尔约80公里的阿桑市和金川市指定为检疫中心的设施。\n专家表示，群众的合作在很大程度上取决于公众的教育以及对风险的适当和准确的沟通，考虑到危机情况下复杂的信息流动可能导致沟通不畅，这并不总是一种保证。\n2003年4月在《海峡时报》上发表的一篇文章说，“对萨斯堡来说，一切都是正确的，但是信息有点慢，不是吗？”，当时的新闻编辑Bertha Henson描述了卫生部在记者招待会上如何被要求确认SGH护士可能患有非典型肺炎的消息\n. 当局说没有，但第二天晚些时候发现21名SGH工作人员被列入非典嫌疑人名单。\n“对于这一突然宣布，我能说的最好听的一件事是，外交部比媒体更晚获得信息，”当时汉森写道。\n谈到这一事件，新加坡医学会现任主席郑智彦教授在2003年的一系列关于非典的备忘录中写道，“快速传播信息——准确的信息——几乎与卫生紧急情况下的透明度同等重要”。\n潘基斯托教授认为，总体而言，新加坡人是团结一致的，支持政府为遏制局势所做的努力。\n但公众的反应很难控制，尤其是在社交媒体上的假新闻。在这种（危机）环境中，“感知即现实，一切即真理”的观念经常起作用。这就是公共风险沟通如此重要的原因。”。\n下载我们的应用程序或订阅我们的Telegram频道获取武汉病毒爆发的最新更新：https://cna.asia/Telegram\n",

Shares in Hong Kong rose 0.57% to a three-week high.\nAustralian shares were up 0.52%, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index rose 0.6%.\nOil futures, which have been in a downtrend since the start of the year, rose in Asia from 13-month lows due to budding optimism about the virus and hopes that output cuts by major producers will support prices.\nThe yuan was little changed in onshore trade and safe-havens such as Treasuries, the yen and the Swiss franc were marginally weaker in a sign of slowly improving sentiment.\nThe global mood brightened after China’s senior medical adviser said on Tuesday the number of new coronavirus cases was falling in some provinces and forecast the epidemic would peak this month.\nThe number of new cases in Hubei, the province at the epicentre of the outbreak, was 1,068 as of Tuesday, down from a peak of over 3,000 new cases on Feb. 4, and the lowest number of new infections since Jan. 31.\nInvestors will likely need to see more evidence that the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has spread to 24 other countries and territories, is indeed receding before they take on more risk.\nConcerns that the virus will slow factory activity and consumer spending in the world’s second-largest economy have roiled global stocks and commodities, and many of these markets are still trying to regain their footing.\n“Evidence suggests the positive mood will continue, and we see some coordination in markets with oil rallying, base metals up and Treasuries coming under pressure,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.\n“It does appear there is increasing comfort that the virus won’t impact growth in a significant way, but I am not ready to buy risk assets yet.”\nU.S. stock futures rose 0.02% in Asia on Wednesday. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq inched to their second consecutive closing high on Tuesday.\nBenchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell further in Asia, pushing yields up to 1.6144%.\nTreasury prices declined on Tuesday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy is resilient.\nPowell also said he is closely monitoring the coronavirus in China, because it could lead to disruptions that affect the global economy.\nChinese firms and factories are struggling to get back to work after the extended Lunar New Year holiday. Some companies say they need loans and are laying off workers as supply chains for global firms from car manufacturers to smartphone makers ruptured.\nChina’s foremost medical adviser on the outbreak, Zhong Nanshan, told Reuters numbers of new cases were falling in some provinces and forecast the epidemic would peak this month, although investors remained sceptical.\nStocks in New Zealand rose to a record high and then pared gains. The local dollar rose 0.9% to $0.6462 for its biggest daily gain since December after the country’s central bank dropped a reference to the chance of further cuts, suggesting its easing cycle might be over.\nIn the commodities market, U.S. crude futures rose 0.88% to $50.38 a barrel, while Brent crude rose 1.33% to $54.83 per barrel on hopes that Chinese demand for oil will pick up once the flu-like virus is contained.\nSaudi Arabia wants global oil producers to agree a quick supply cut in response to the coronavirus, sources familiar with the kingdom’s thinking have told Reuters, which is another supportive factor for crude futures.\nIn the onshore market, the yuan held steady at 6.9685 per dollar.\nThe yen traded at 109.87 versus the greenback, on course for its third day of decline, while the Swiss franc held steady at 0.9751 against the dollar.

        "news_content_translate_en": "China's leadership on Wednesday touted \"positive results\" from efforts to contain the new coronavirus epidemic but warned it still faced a \"large-scale war\" against the outbreak as the death toll climbed past 1 100.\nPresident Xi Jinping chaired a meeting of the ruling Politburo Standing Committee after figures showed that the number of new cases dropped for the second straight day, fuelling hopes the epidemic could peak later this month.\nXi said there were \"positive results\" but warned that the country \"must not relax\" its epidemic control efforts, according to state media, as authorities have kept tens of millions of people under lockdown.\nChina still faces a \"large-scale war\" and a \"big test\", said state broadcaster CCTV in a readout of the gathering.\nAuthorities said Wednesday another 97 people had died in China, raising the national toll to 1,113, while more than 44 600 people had been infected by the newly named COVID-19 virus.\nThe number of people infected on a cruise ship off Japan, meanwhile, rose to 174 -- the biggest cluster outside the Chinese mainland.\nThe World Health Organisation has called the epidemic a \"very grave threat\".\nMost of the deaths and majority of cases have been in central Hubei province, whose capital, Wuhan, is the epicentre of the outbreak. Some 56 million have been placed under virtual quarantine in the province.\nThe epidemic has threatened to harm the world's second-largest economy, with ANZ bank warning that China's first-quarter GDP growth would slow to 3.2-4.0 percent, down from a previous projection of 5.0 percent.\nIt is also disrupting sporting and cultural events in China, with motorsport governing body FIA announcing the suspension of the Formula One Grand Prix in Shanghai that had been scheduled for April 19 due to the \"continued spread\" of the coronavirus.\nBut in a positive development, the number of new cases has fallen in Hubei for two straight days with some 1,600 reported, according to figures from the National Health Commission.\nOutside the province, the number of new patients has declined every day for the past week.\n\"In general, the number of new cases is now slowly decreasing,\" Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at China's National Health Commission, said in a video conference with medical staff in Wuhan on Tuesday.\n'Very grave threat'\n\"When does the turning point occur? I can't say. But I think it's at its peak in mid- to late-February,\" he said.\nAustralia's chief medical officer was more circumspect, however.\n\"I think we've just got to watch the data very closely over the coming weeks before we make any predictions,\" Brendan Murphy told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\nIn Geneva, the WHO is hosting a two-day international conference on combatting the virus during which it decided to name it COVID-19 - in keeping with guidelines aimed at avoiding linking disease to an animal or a geographic location.\nWarning it posed a \"very grave threat\" to the world, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there was a \"window of opportunity to hit hard and stand in unison to fight this virus in every corner\".\nIn addition to locking down Hubei, authorities have restricted movements in several other cities far from the epicentre in its unprecedented effort to contain the virus.\nAuthorities have found a cluster in the northern port city of Tianjin, where 39 people were infected in one department store, according to the official Xinhua news agency. The first case was a salesperson who was diagnosed on January 31.\nCruise ship infections rise\nSeveral countries have banned arrivals from China, while major airlines have halted flights to and from the country, as hundreds of people have now been infected in some two-dozen countries.\nThe biggest cluster of cases outside China is on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan's coast.\nAn additional 39 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive for COVID-19, raising the total number of cases to 174, while thousands of passengers and crew face a second week in quarantine.\nThe case of a British man who passed on the virus to at least 11 other people - without having been in China - has raised fears of a new phase of contagion abroad.\nThe 53-year-old man caught the virus while attending a conference in Singapore and then passed it on to several compatriots while on holiday in the French Alps, before finally being diagnosed back in Britain.\nGiven China's economic heft and position at the nexus of global supply chains, the virus is affecting companies far and wide and across multiple sectors across the world.\nInternational conferences are also being affected, with this week's Singapore Air Show - Asia's biggest - badly hit by exhibitors withdrawing and low attendance.\nUS chip giant Intel, Facebook, Chinese phone maker Vivo, and Cisco, meanwhile, have all withdrawn from the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona over coronavirus fears.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Robust iron ore prices drove BHP Group to its best result in five years, still slightly off estimates, with the miner saying containment this quarter of a coronavirus that is spreading around the globe should limit any economic impact.\nBHP’s underlying profit from continuing operations rose to $5.19 billion for the six months ended Dec. 31 from $4.03 billion a year earlier, the strongest result since the same period of 2015, lifted by lofty iron ore prices after last year’s supply disruption out of Brazil and solid Chinese demand.\nThe results were below estimates of a profit of $5.28 billion, according to analysts polled by research firm Vuma Financial. An interim dividend of 65 cents, 10 cents higher than last year, undershot forecasts for a dividend of 71 cents.\nThe dividend came in “below market as board takes conservative approach given coronavirus (63% pay-out vs 70% 3-yr average),” UBS said in a note.\nBHP has not yet seen a major impact on its business from the coronavirus that was discovered in China at the end of last year, and customers have kept paying for their orders, the miner’s new chief executive, Mike Henry, said on Tuesday.\nHe added, though, that other supply disruptions have lent support to iron ore.\n“We are moving all of our product. Demand remains pretty resilient. Prices have held up in part because of some other supply side disruptions,” Henry said.\nRio Tinto downgraded its forecast for iron ore shipments for the year on Monday after a cyclone off the coast of Western Australia earlier this month.\nBHP is the first among its peers to report its earnings. Global miners are all expected to have cashed in on last year’s higher iron ore prices, with a further boost coming as China pumped more money into its economy to alleviate an economic slowdown. China’s iron ore imports were at their second-highest level ever in 2019, further boosting profits.\nThe world’s biggest miner is positioning itself well in a world that is decarbonising, Henry also said.\nBHP is seeking to raise its exposure to “future facing” commodities copper and nickel, through exploration and early stage acquisition, he said, adding that it would be open to selling its thermal coal assets if it can find a buyer at the right price given the deteriorating prospects for the market.\n“We need more copper and we need more nickel,” Henry told reporters as he pledged to meet “social value” commitments.\nBHP has also been using more renewable power, is assembling targets to scale back so-called “scope three” emissions - or the emissions of its customers - and is completing a review into industry associations that it funds to ensure they comply with its climate change goals.\nAs it seeks to improve efficiencies within the company, BHP will also look at restructuring its technological operations and making more staff permanent, Henry said.\nShares rose 0.9 percent on Tuesday to $A38.83 amid an uplift in the mining sector after Beijing stepped up stimulus to cushion the impact of the corona virus outbreak.\nFree cash flow for the miner came in at $3.7 billion, compared with $3.6 billion a year earlier.\n",

More than half of those cases have been on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan.\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that there had been 92 cases of human-to-human spread of the coronavirus in 12 countries outside China.\n\"We have not seen sustained local transmission of coronavirus except in specific circumstances like the Diamond Princess cruise ship,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\nRussia, however, was taking no chances. Starting on Thursday, it will suspend entry of many Chinese citizens.\nBy the end of this week, the WHO said, 40 countries in Africa and 29 in the Americas are due to have the ability to detect COVID-19.\n\"Many of these countries have been sending samples to other countries for testing, waiting several days for results. Now they can do it themselves within 24-48 hours,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\nChina says figures indicating a slowdown in new cases in recent days show that aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan.\nThe WHO's Mike Ryan said China had success with \"putting out the fire\" first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday are monitored.\n\"Right now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the correct one,\" Mike Ryan said\nThe numbers appear encouraging, said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Britain's University of Edinburgh, who described himself as cautious.\nChinese state television said Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to fall victim. The hospital was designated solely for treating virus-infected patients.\nGLOBAL REPERCUSSIONS\nDespite global concerns about the economic impact of the disease, China's ambassador to the European Union said on Tuesday this would be \"limited, short-term and manageable\" and that Beijing had enough resources to step in if needed.\nChinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020 despite the epidemic.\nEconomists are warning of potential mass layoffs in China later this year if the virus is not contained soon.\n\"The employment situation is OK in the first quarter, but if the virus is not contained by end-March, then from the second quarter, we'll see a big round of layoffs,\" said Dan Wang, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). Job losses could run as high as 4.5 million, he forecast.\nBritain's biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks because of the coronavirus.\nComponents made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled around the world, and Hubei province is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in said the economy there was in an emergency situation and required stimulus as the epidemic had disrupted demand for South Korean goods.\nSingapore announced a $4.5 billion financial package to help contain the outbreak in the city-state and weather its economic impact.\nJapan, where the economy was already shrinking and the epidemic has created fears of recession, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to put limits on public crowds while some companies are telling employees to work from home.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "By Nurul Hanis IzmirKUALA LUMPUR, Feb 11 -- The Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) is exploring palm oil-based medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) as an anti-viral property, with the aim to boost the immune system to protect from the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) attack, director-general Dr Ahmad Parveez Ghulam Kadir said.Noting that the process is still at the preliminary stage, he said more studies needed to be conducted in order to confirm the anti-viral effects.“This will not happen overnight, but the potential is there, and we need continuous research explorations to get there.“Our main concern now is not only the market but to try our best in every possible means to help China and the world by contributing as much we can through research in finding ways to protect from the outbreak,” he told Bernama.Ahmad Parveez noted that previous preliminary studies suggested that MCT may disintegrate viral envelopes and some researchers have shown their interests in discovering the anti-viral effects of palm-based MCT and MPOB would be working closely with them.In addition, the board has also noticed increasing demand for palm-based MCT in China since last year, particularly in the applications in food for special medical purposes and powdered meal replacers.According to Ahmad Parveez, there were some Chinese experts who had engaged with MPOB to seek collaborative study related to palm tocotrienols’ possible effect on human immunity, which is now being widely discussed to prevent the coronavirus infection.“Previous studies have suggested that tocotrienols can benefit immune health by increasing the concentration of anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin G (anti-TT IgG) antibody in patients prone to immune dysfunction and auto-immunity disorder,” he added.Asked on his concern about the decline in palm oil demand from China, Ahmad Parveez acknowledged that the coronavirus had affected businesses of hotel, restaurant and catering (HORECA) sectors in China as most of the shopping malls and restaurants are closed during this period.“This has affected the demand for medium pack cooking oils in China which are mainly used in the HORECA sector in blended cooking oil form. These however will be compensated by higher demand for bulk import of palm oil as frying oils for instant noodles, snacks, canned foods and pre-packaged foods.“Currently, most of the Chinese (in China) are advised to stay at home and told not to leave their house unnecessarily in order to avoid the coronavirus from being spread further. Besides home-cooked food, instant noodles, snacks, canned foods and pre-packaged foods become daily essential supplies.”He said based on the big data analysis by Eleme app, an O2O (online-to-offline) delivery platform owned by Alibaba Group, food is the top purchased and delivered products in the past few weeks since January 23, followed by purchases and deliveries of daily necessities and medicines.Among others, convenient store food (mainly pre-packaged and instant foods) are the top purchased food online followed by fruits and fast foods.The big data also showed increased awareness among the Chinese public in preventing the virus spread whereby most of them are avoiding going out and order online delivery.-- BERNAMA  ",

There were no confirmed cases in the city but de Blasio announced plans to provide up to 1,200 hospital beds if needed.\nU.S. stock markets fell for the fifth consecutive day on investors’ alarm about the respiratory disease spreading.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed an infection of the new coronavirus in California in someone who had not traveled outside the United States or been exposed to a person known to have the virus, a first for the country. How the person was infected was not known.\nAt the White House, Trump said he was not ready to institute new travel restrictions for countries such as South Korea and Italy that are dealing with outbreaks - although he could not rule it out. The State Department raised its travel alert level for South Korea and urged Americans to reconsider going there.\nThe CDC has advised Americans to not visit China and South Korea, and on Wednesday stepped up travel warnings for Iran, Italy and Mongolia.\n“The risk to the American people remains very low,” Trump said, flanked by Pence and public health officials.\nHe said the spread of the virus in the United States was not “inevitable” and then went on to say: “It probably will, it possibly will. It could be at a very small level, or it could be at a larger level. Whatever happens we’re totally prepared.”\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, said that while the virus was contained in the United States, Americans must prepare for a potential outbreak as transmissions spread outside of China.\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the United States has 59 coronavirus cases, including 42 American passengers repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan.\n“We have to be alert to the possibility of a pandemic,” Peter Marks, director of the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in an interview.\nGlobal stock markets have slumped in recent days due to worries over a prolonged disruption to supply chains and economies from the virus, which has infected about 80,000 people and killed nearly 3,000, mostly in China.\nU.S. stocks turned lower in afternoon trading - the S&P 500 index fell for a fifth straight day and the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI ended down 123.77 points, or 0.46%. [.N]\nTrump, who is running for a second term in the November election, has been increasingly alarmed by the drop in U.S. stock markets, which he considers a barometer of the health of the American economy and sees as important to his re-election.\nHe told reporters at the White House that fears of the coronavirus had hurt the stock markets. But he also blamed the Democratic presidential candidates for spooking investors.\n“I think the financial markets are very upset when they look at the Democrat candidates standing on that stage making fools out of themselves,” Trump said in reference to debates among the Democratic contenders vying for the right to challenge him.\nEarlier in the day, Trump accused two cable TV news channels, CNN and MSNBC, of presenting the danger from the virus in as bad a light as possible and upsetting financial markets.\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, on Wednesday dismissed Trump’s assertion in India that the coronavirus was under control at home.\n“I don’t think the president knows what he’s talking about, once again,” she told reporters.\nAsked about her comment, Trump responded: “I think Speaker Pelosi’s incompetent.”\nTrump is seeking $2.5 billion from Congress to boost the government’s virus response, an amount Democrats said falls far short of what is needed. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called for $8.5 billion to prepare.\n“We’re going to spend whatever is appropriate,” Trump said.\nA congressional source said the Democratic-controlled House would attempt to advance a coronavirus emergency funding bill before the next recess, scheduled to begin on March 12.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December has infected tens of thousands of people in China and beyond and triggered alarm around the world. (here) Here is what we know about the disease it causes and how it spreads:\n* Like other coronaviruses, the new virus - which causes a disease now called COVID-19 - is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n* Scientists in China who studied swabs from infected patients say the new coronavirus behaves quite like flu viruses, suggesting it may spread more easily than previously thought.\n* COVID-19 infection has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.\n* A World Health Organization-led team of investigating scientists in China has said that the epidemic there peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining steadily since then.\n* They also found that the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan.\n* Infectious disease and virus specialists estimate that each infected person in the epidemic is infecting, on average, two to three other people.\n* The WHO said on Monday that the COVID-19 outbreak was not out of control globally and does not have a large-scale death toll, so it was “too early” to speak of a pandemic.\n* Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.\n* Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with “crown”-like spikes.\n* Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species.\n* Genetic data suggests the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a “recombinant” virus strain.\n",

On the one hand, these studies show that this pathogen is closely related to the pathogen of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or SARS, And other coronavirus attacks bats.\nOn the other hand, bioinformatists have found some unusual fragments in RNA, which are similar to SARS gene and 2019-ncov gene.\nAbout When other scientists tried to identify them, they concluded that the inserts were left behind by \"new HIV and snake pathogens.\".\nMany scientists are skeptical of this, drawing attention to the unusually short insertion length of foreign RNA, as well as other characteristics. Molecular biologists from the University of Michigan (USA) tested these theories and used more advanced methods to analyze new samples of 2019 ncov gene.\nTheir calculations show that 2019-ncov, in principle, is unlikely to inherit \"these RNA sites with any other virus, including HIV\". In addition, these segments are closest to similar parts of the coronavirus ratg13 gene that invaded bats, the presumed 2019 ncov ancestor.

Markets can cope even if there is big risk as long as we can see the end of the tunnel,\" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n\"But at the moment, no one can tell how long this will last and how severe it will get.\"\nMainland China - where the virus originated late last year - reported 327 new cases on Friday, the lowest since Jan. 23.\nBut with new infections reported around the world now surpassing those in China, World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said nations should prepare.\n\"This virus has pandemic potential,\" Tedros said. \"This is not a time for fear. This is a time for taking action to prevent infection and save lives now.\"\nA Reuters tally showed about 10 countries reported their first virus cases in past 24 hours, including Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa and the first case in sub-Saharan Africa.\nUS investment bank BofA cut its world growth forecast to the lowest level since the peak of the financial crisis, and ratings agency Moody's said a coronavirus pandemic would trigger global and US recessions in the first half of the year.\nMEDICAL STOCKPILING\nIn addition to stockpiling medical supplies, governments ordered schools shut and canceled big gatherings, including sports events, to try to halt the spread of the flu-like disease known as COVID-19.\nUS President Donald Trump's administration was considering invoking special powers to rapidly expand U.S. production of protective gear, two officials told Reuters.\nIn Europe, France's number of reported cases doubled, Germany warned of an impending epidemic and Greece, a gateway for refugees from the Middle East, announced tighter border controls.\n\"We have a crisis before us. An epidemic is on its way,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said.\nThe death toll in Italy, Europe's worst-hit country, rose to 17 on Thursday and the number of people who tested positive for the illness increased by more than 200 to 650.

One of its flight attendant who worked on Seoul-Los Angeles flights has tested positive.\nThe country's top airline said it also planned to expand these procedures to other routes.\nThere is particular concern over a case in Japan in which a woman tested positive for the virus for a second time. Second positive tests have also been reported in China and could imply contracting the disease does not confer immunity.\nScientists warned that much remains unknown about the virus, including how long it can survive on surfaces.\nHong Kong quarantined a pet dog of a coronavirus patient after it showed \"weak positive\" results for the virus, even though it did not have any symptoms. Further tests would be conducted to confirm if the dog had been infected.\nUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Robert Redfield said the agency was evaluating how long coronavirus could be infectious on surfaces.\n\"On copper and steel its pretty typical, it's pretty much about 2 hours,\" Redfield told a House of Representatives hearing. \"But I will say on other surfaces - cardboard or plastic - it's longer, and so we are looking at this.\"\nHe said infections contracted from surfaces rather than through the air could have contributed to the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, where about 700 passengers and crew caught the disease.\nTOKYO OLYMPICS FUTURE\nJapan is scheduled to host the 2020 Olympics in July but the head of the WHO's emergency program, Dr Mike Ryan, said discussions were being held with organisers about whether it should go ahead.\nThe coronavirus has played havoc with global aviation and tourism as airlines cancel flights, countries ban visitors from hot spots and nervous passengers put off travel.\nCalifornia-based Facebook Inc said it would cancel its annual developer conference and Microsoft Corp followed suit by withdrawing from a gaming conference scheduled for next month.\nThe WHO's Ryan said Iran's outbreak may be worse than realised. It has suffered the highest death toll outside China, with 26 dead from 245 reported cases.\nUS intelligence agencies are monitoring the spread of coronavirus, including in Iran and India, sources familiar with the matter said.\nThe virus has so far mainly battered China, causing nearly 80,000 infections and almost 2,800 deaths, according official Chinese figures. It has spread to another 46 countries, where about 3,700 cases and 57 deaths have been reported, according to the WHO.\nThere is no cure for the coronavirus, which can lead to pneumonia, and a vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop.\n",

Beijing and the provinces of Heilongjiang and Henan were the locations of the other three fatalities.\nThe number of new cases outside Hubei stood at 24, up from 5 on the previous day and reversing five days of declines. Ten of those were in Beijing.\nA statement published by the Comission on Thursday, citing a meeting held the previous day, said that the situation in Hubei province and Wuhan is “still complex and serious”, and added that the risk of a rebound in infection in other regions should not be overlooked.\nAlso, some coronavirus patients discharged from hospitals after recovery have been readmitted after testing positive again, health authorities said recently.\nA health official in southern Guangdong province told state media on Wednesday that 14% of patients discharged from hospital experienced a resurgence of the virus, although they had not infected any others they had been in close contact with.\nThe number of new confirmed coronavirus cases in Beijing on Feb. 26 had jumped to 10 from zero the previous day. Pang Xinghuo, deputy head of Beijing Center of Disease Control, told a news briefing on Thursday that it was a cluster case.\nThe new cases all stemmed from a property management agency in Beijing’s Chaoyang district, and had either been working in the same office or sharing the same dormitory, Pang said.\nThe case showed that companies were not putting in place adequate monitoring of staff during their 14-day quarantine period, Chen Bei, deputy secretary general of Beijing city government, told a briefing later on Thursday.\nIt has also highlighted the risks of crowded dormitories and poorly ventilated basement housing often used for some workers.\nChen said no more than six people should share basement dormitories, which should have windows. She also reiterated that people returning to Beijing must undergo a 14-day self quarantine before they’re allowed to go back to work.\nChinese authorities are also turning their attention to potential sources of infection from abroad, as the number of new cases outside China now exceed those domestically.\nThe Shanghai government said it is trying to identify anyone who came into contact with a coronavirus patient who arrived in the city from Iran, another coronavirus hotspot.\nMore than 40 countries and regions outside mainland China have reported infections. On Wednesday, cases were detected for the first time in Brazil, Pakistan, Norway, Greece, Romania and Algeria. The coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people and killed nearly 2,800, the majority in China.\nA senior medical advisor in the Chinese government who won fame for combating the SARS epidemic in 2003 on Thursday said the original source of the coronavirus remains unclear.\n“Though the virus was first discovered in China, it may not have originated from China,” said Zhong Nanshan, an 83-year-old epidemiologist.\nZhong said he believes there are other wildlife species apart from the pangolin, which is suspected as the original source emerging from a seafood market in Wuhan that also sold wild animals, that carry coronavirus.\nZhong said China would present a video report to the European Respiratory Society to share China’s experience in addressing the virus outbreak.\nHe again repeated an earlier forecast that the coronavirus outbreak in China will be contained by end-April after peaking in mid-to-late-February.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\nBy Peter Apps\nLONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - As the coronavirus outbreak turns global, stock markets and world populations are waking up to the threat of a global pandemic. That, though, hasn’t been the only disturbing global news this week. In the Middle East and Asia in particular, military tensions are on the rise – and major countries seem ever less bothered about taking off the gloves.\nMost worrying, arguably, were events over the last 24 hours in Syria. As that civil war enters its final throes, Russia and Turkey have been increasingly at loggerheads. The killing of 33 Turkish soldiers in an apparent Syrian government air strike on Thursday took that confrontation into untested territory, with Ankara now furious at not just Moscow and Damascus but also Western nations it believes have abandoned it.\nOn Friday, Turkey said it would no longer stop Syrian refugees from making their way to Europe, threatening a return of the mass population moves last seen in 2015-16. Then, the arrival of hundreds of thousands in Europe fuelled considerable popular discontent, powering the rise of right-wing parties. That comes against a backdrop of further confrontation between Syria and Israel, with Israeli helicopters reportedly injuring several Syrian personnel in attacks along the border.\nTensions and violence between Iran and its regional enemies in the Gulf are also arguably at an all-time high, even if the U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani does appear to have deterred direct regional escalation. In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops have been on the offensive again around the town of Luhansk. And in the South China Sea, this week saw Chinese forces target a U.S. plane with what was described as a military laser, prompting angry complaints from Washington.\nDrawing a direct line between these confrontations and the virus outbreak is almost certainly a step too far, although the Chinese government in particular might welcome a distraction from the outbreak. So might Iran, already home to one of the largest outbreaks outside Asia, and where popular discontent with the government has also been on the rise. What is more unarguably the case, however, is that the resources governments will need to plough into tackling the disease will likely prove a potent distraction from events elsewhere.\nWhat that will mean will be different in different places – and the long-term legacy may be distinctly different from the short-term consequences. In Hong Kong, worries over the virus seem to have dramatically reduced protests against the government in Beijing. But they have also dramatically intensified anger and frustration with the mainland, which many Hong Kong residents see as mishandling the disease and exporting it to the city.\nIf, as seems increasingly likely, the virus outbreak dramatically dents global economic growth, perhaps even producing a recession, that will likely raise the political temperature almost everywhere.\nMuch, of course, will depend on how serious the outbreak proves. Particularly deadly outbreaks of disease have traditionally limited wars, at least their duration, decimating armies and leaving populations too weak to stomach serious conflict. Already, an outbreak in South Korea has prompted the United States to cancel planned military drills.\nWhether coronavirus is truly enough to force nations towards an even temporary peace, however, may well be in doubt. What does look increasingly probable, is that it will affect millions and perhaps kill hundreds of thousands in multiple countries around the world.\nGeopolitical confrontation invariably makes tackling such outbreaks harder, and the effect of conflict – and particularly mass population moves – can help their spread. Most notable would be the Spanish flu outbreak that swept the world following World War One. The death toll of that outbreak – believed to have affected up to a quarter of the global population - is estimated at between 40-100 million.\nIf coronavirus does go global, it is still not impossible that will drive countries together rather than apart. At worst, though, it may simply further undermine the already deteriorating trust millions of people around the world have in their leaders and institutions to protect them. That’s a recipe for further global instability, just as the world can afford it least. *** Peter Apps is a writer on international affairs, globalisation, conflict and other issues.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "（这里表达的观点是作者路透社专栏作家的观点。）\n作者：Peter Apps\n路透伦敦2月28日电---随着冠状病毒疫情向全球蔓延，股市和全球民众正意识到全球大流行的威胁。不过，这并不是本周唯一令人不安的全球新闻。特别是在中东和亚洲，军事紧张局势正在加剧，而主要国家似乎对摘掉手套的烦恼越来越少。\n可以说，最令人担忧的是叙利亚过去24小时发生的事件。随着那场内战进入最后的阵痛，俄罗斯和土耳其之间的争执越来越激烈。周四，在叙利亚政府的一次明显的空袭中，33名土耳其士兵被杀，这使得这场对抗进入了未经考验的领域，安卡拉现在不仅对莫斯科和大马士革感到愤怒，而且对它认为已经放弃这场对抗的西方国家感到愤怒。\n上周五，土耳其表示，它将不再阻止叙利亚难民前往欧洲，这将威胁到上一次出现在2015-16年的大规模人口迁移的回归。随后，数十万人来到欧洲，激起了相当大的民众不满，推动了右翼政党的崛起。这是在叙利亚和以色列进一步对抗的背景下发生的，据报道，以色列直升机在边境地区的袭击中造成数名叙利亚人员受伤。\n伊朗与其在海湾地区的宿敌之间的紧张局势和暴力冲突也可以说达到了历史最高水平，即使美国无人机袭击导致伊朗少将卡塞姆·索莱马尼死亡似乎确实阻止了地区局势的直接升级。在乌克兰东部，俄罗斯军队在卢甘斯克镇附近再次发动进攻。而在南中国海，本周中国军队用所谓的军用激光瞄准了一架美国飞机，引起华盛顿愤怒的抱.\n在这些对抗和病毒爆发之间划出一条直线几乎可以肯定是一个太远的步骤，尽管中国政府可能特别欢迎分散对病毒爆发的注意力。伊朗也有可能成为亚洲以外爆发疫情最多的国家之一，民众对政府的不满情绪也在上升。然而，更不可辩驳的是，各国政府将需要投入资源来应对这一疾病，这可能会有力地分散人们对其它事件的注意力。\n这意味着在不同的地方会有所不同，而长期的影响可能与短期的影响截然不同。在香港，对病毒的担忧似乎大大减少了对北京政府的抗议活动。但他们也极大地加剧了内地的愤怒和挫折感，许多香港居民认为这是对疾病的处理不当，并将其出口到城市。\n如果病毒的爆发越来越有可能严重影响全球经济增长，甚至可能导致经济衰退，那么这可能会提高几乎所有地方的政治温度。\n当然，这在很大程度上取决于疫情的严重程度。特别是致命的疾病爆发，传统上限制了战争，至少是战争的持续时间，造成军队的大量伤亡，使人口虚弱到无法承受严重冲突。韩国爆发的疫情已经促使美国取消了军事演习计划。\n然而，冠状病毒是否真的足以迫使各国走向一个甚至是暂时的和平，这可能是个疑问。看起来越来越有可能的是，它将影响到全球多个国家数百万人，甚至可能导致数十万人死亡。\n地缘政治对抗总是使应对此类疫情更加困难，而冲突的影响——特别是大规模人口流动——有助于疫情的蔓. 最值得注意的是一战后席卷全球的西班牙流感爆发。据估计，此次疫情造成的死亡人数在4000万至1亿之间，据信已影响到全球四分之一的人口。\n如果冠状病毒真的走向全球，推动各国走到一起而不是分道扬镳仍然不是不可能的。不过，最坏的情况是，这可能会进一步削弱全世界数百万人对他们的领导人和保护他们的机构已经日益恶化的信任。这是导致全球进一步不稳定的一个秘诀，正如世界最不可能承受的那样。***彼得·阿普斯是一位研究国际事务、全球化、冲突和其他问题的作家。他是21世纪研究项目的创始人和执行主任；PS21是一个非国家、无党派、无意识形态的智囊团。2006年，由于战区车祸瘫痪，他也在博客上谈论自己的残疾和其他话题。他以前是路透社的记者，目前仍由汤森路透支付报酬。自2016年以来，他一直是英国陆军预备役部队和英国工党的成员，也是该党的积极筹款人。（贾尔斯·埃尔古德编辑",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Reuters) - California is monitoring more than 8,400 people who arrived on commercial flights for coronavirus symptoms from “points of concern,” but the state lacks test kits and has been held back by federal testing rules, Governor Gavin Newsom said on Thursday.\nCalifornia has only 200 test kits, but has appealed for testing protocols to be expanded to include Americans who may catch the virus as it spreads through U.S. communities, Newsom told a news briefing in Sacramento, the state capital.\nNewsom said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has assured the state that testing protocols will be advanced and access to test kits will expand “exponentially” in the coming days.\nCalifornia on Wednesday reported a coronavirus case of unknown origin, making it potentially the first incident of the virus spreading within U.S. communities.\n“It is not surprising that we have seen these mini outbreaks occur around the world,” said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner,  an epidemiology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health. “We know the virus is easily spread.”\nThe female patient, who lives in northern California’s Solano County, was not initially tested for the new coronavirus because she did not meet criteria laid out by the CDC, according to a statement by UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, where she is being treated.\nDr. Sonia Angell, California’s state public health officer, said local, state and federal health investigators were contacting and isolating individuals who may have been exposed to the patient.\nSolano County is the home of Travis Air Force Base, one of the U.S. military bases in California that have acted as quarantine centers for U.S. citizens repatriated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the current coronavirus outbreak.\n“She had to be exposed from someone else with coronavirus. We know that people with infection were taken to places of isolation or quarantine in that general area,” Klausner said.\nUC Davis said no one on its main campus has tested positive for the virus, known as COVID-19, but “out of an abundance of caution,” three campus residents are currently in isolation. One of them, who is showing symptoms of illness, has been tested for the virus, but the results are not yet in.\nThe CDC’s protocol had called for coronavirus testing in individuals with a fever or respiratory illness who have a travel history or contact that could have led to exposure to the virus.\nCalifornia officials said this protocol had to be expanded in light of the “inevitable” local spread within the United States. At least 33 people had tested positive for the virus, but five have since left the state, official said.\n“The case from yesterday is giving the CDC a lot to consider on revising those protocols so more individuals will be tested,” said Mark Ghaly director of California’s Health and Human Services Agency, referring to the woman from Solano County.\nCDC Director Robert Redfield told a U.S. congressional hearing on Thursday that more test kits were being sent to California and the agency now backs expanded testing.\n“When a clinician or a public health individual suspects coronavirus, then we should be able to get a test for coronavirus, so that’s the current guidance that went out today,” he said.\nNewsom said the CDC has pledged to send more personnel to California to track the potential spread of the virus.\nWith new infections reported around the world now surpassing those in mainland China, the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Thursday even rich nations should prepare.\n“No country should assume it won’t get cases, that would be a fatal mistake, quite literally,” Tedros said, pointing to Italy, where 17 people have died in Europe’s worst outbreak.\n",

While those gains have been erased, markets seem to be recovering due to buying across sectors in finance, energy, auto and metal stocks.\nThe development comes after Asian shares steadied from early losses on Monday as investors placed their hopes on a coordinated global monetary policy response to weather the damaging economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic.\nPandemic fears pushed markets off a precipice last week, wiping more than $5 trillion from global share value as stocks cratered to their steepest slump in more than a decade. Indian stock markets also saw massive losses last week, triggering a bloodbath on D-Street.\nThe sheer scale of losses prompted financial markets to price in policy responses from the US Federal Reserve to the Bank of Japan and the Reserve Bank of Australia.\nFutures now imply a full 50 basis point cut by the US Federal Reserve in March while Australian markets are pricing in a quarter-point cut at the RBA's Tuesday meeting.\nAlso helping calm market nerves, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday the central bank would take necessary steps to stabilise financial markets.\nIn equities, Chinese shares opened higher with the blue-chip index up 1.5 per cent.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.4 per cent, turning around from a loss of about 0.3 per cent earlier in the day.\nE-minis for the S&P500, which were down more than 1 per cent at one point, were last up 0.3 per cent while Japan's Nikkei, which opened 1.3 per cent lower at a six month trough, climbed 0.4 per cent.\nAustralia's S&P ASX/200, which had tumbled 3 per cent, was last off 1.8 per cent. Benchmark US 10-Year Treasuries hit a fresh record low of 1.0750 per cent. Despite some stability in the market, analysts still expect volatility to persist.\n\"Any signs that new cases are beginning to taper could be seen as a positive catalyst for the market especially given that some of the market complacency has reduced with equity valuations much lower vs few weeks ago,\" Nomura analysts wrote in a note.\n\"In the very near term until 1Q reporting results, we expect Asian equities may remain quite volatile,\" they added.\n\"However, on a medium-term basis we believe the risk-reward is now getting favourable, assuming the virus does not take the form of a virulent global pandemic.\"\nLeaders in Europe, the Middle East and the Americas rolled out bans on big gatherings and stricter travel restrictions over the weekend as cases of the new coronavirus spread.\nThe epidemic, which began in China, has killed almost 3,000 people worldwide as authorities race to contain infections in Iran, Italy, South Korea and the United States.\nBoth official and private surveys, released on Saturday and Monday respectively, showed China's factory activity collapsing to its worst levels on record as the virus crippled broad areas of the economy.\n\"It is now highly probable that the coronavirus will spread globally,\" Citi analysts said in a note. \"Financial markets may over-react until they have visibility on the actual impact.\"\nInvestor panic last week sent bonds soaring and stocks plunging. The S&P 500 index fell 11.5 per cent, only its fifth double-digit weekly percentage drop since 1940.\nOn Monday, oil extended losses before steadying on expectations OPEC may cut production. Brent crude last traded at $50.41 per barrel and U.S. crude at $45.30 per barrel.\nIn currencies, investors sought shelter in Japanese yen, which jumped to a 20-week high on the dollar in tandem with the massive shift in money markets to price US rate cuts.\nAll of this leaves just about every major asset class on edge and few analysts sounding optimistic.\nThat left the dollar index a shade weaker at 97.911.\nA further set of manufacturing surveys from around the world due later on Monday will provide investors more detail on the virus' impact on the global economy.\nLater in the week, central bank meetings in Australia, on Tuesday, and Canada, on Wednesday, will be closely watched.\n(With inputs from Reuters)\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "KIRKLAND, Wash. (Reuters) - Six people in the Seattle area have died of illness caused by the new coronavirus, health officials said on Monday, as authorities across the United States scrambled to prepare for more infections with an emphasis on increasing testing capacity.\nDr. Jeff Duchin, health officer for the Seattle and King County Public Health agency, announced the rise in fatalities from the previous two in Washington state.\nEight of the 14 total cases in his jurisdiction are linked to an outbreak at a nursing facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, including four deaths, Duchin said at a news conference.\nAt least four of the six people who died were either elderly or had underlying health conditions or both, Duchin said.\nNevertheless, Vice President Mike Pence, speaking at a White House briefing, said the risk to Americans from coronavirus remained low.\nEarlier in the day, two senior officials said the Trump administration was weighing whether to have the president issue an emergency declaration to help cover state and local costs of responding to the coronavirus.\nFurther tightening of travel restrictions on countries hard-hit by the virus also were under consideration, President Donald Trump said during a meeting with pharmaceutical company executives.\nFood and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn said he expects that by the end of this week close to 1 million coronavirus tests will be completed.\nThe total number of cases detected by the public health system in Washington state now stands at 18, the most of any state. In addition to the 14 King County cases, four residents of nearby Snohomish County have tested positive for the virus, officials said.\n“We expect the number of cases will continue to increase in the coming days and weeks, and we are taking this situation extremely seriously,” Duchin said.\nHowever, he also said the vast majority of diagnosed patients have mild to moderate symptoms and do not need hospitalization.\nIn addition to confirmed cases, King County has about 29 potential cases awaiting test results, so the number there could soon rise, officials said. Tests were being conducted on about 200 samples a day, and health officials expect to boost the number of tests to at least 1,000 a day soon.\nDuchin said his county was not recommending school closures or cancellation of any events.\nAs of Sunday, the number of confirmed and presumptive cases in the United States had risen to 91, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said. Many of those were among people repatriated to the United States, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship previously quarantined in Japan or from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the global outbreak originated.\nThe number of presumed cases reported by states but not yet officially confirmed by the CDC stood at 27, up from seven previously. The CDC will confirm the tests sent by states with their own diagnostics. So far, 10 states, including California and New York, have confirmed or presumed cases.\nU.S. stock markets briefly pared gains following the announcement of an increase in fatalities but closed higher - the S&P 500 by 4.6%, the Dow Jones by 5% and the NASDAQ by 4.5%. World stock markets had a weeklong slide last week on coronavirus fears.\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo welcomed a CDC decision allowing New York to test for the virus. There have been more than 87,000 cases worldwide and nearly 3,000 deaths in 60 countries since it emerged in China in December, the World Health Organization said.\n“I would like to have a goal of 1,000-tests-per-day capacity within one week because, again, the more testing, the better,” Cuomo said at a briefing on Monday.\nFederal health officials have said the number of test kits for coronavirus would be radically expanded in coming weeks. The United States appeared poised for a spike in cases, partly because there would be more testing to confirm infections.\nProtective gear and test kits were being distributed to U.S. military facilities with a priority on distribution to the Korean Peninsula, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army General Mark Milley, said at a briefing.\nSouth Korea is one of the hardest hit countries with 4,335 cases and 26 deaths.\nU.S. government military laboratories were working to develop a vaccine, Milley said.\nTrump said his administration has asked pharmaceutical companies to accelerate work on the development of a coronavirus vaccine, but provided no details.\nTop U.S. health officials have said any vaccine is up to 18 months away and there is no treatment for the respiratory disease, although patients can receive supportive care.\nU.S. health secretary Alex Azar said the administration is working on supply chain challenges for pharmaceutical companies in response to coronavirus as many active ingredients come from China.\nThe White House is also expected to meet this week with top executives from U.S. airlines and the cruise industry over the impact of the virus to their businesses, two people briefed on the matter said.\nAs early as this week, the U.S. Congress could debate and pass emergency funding, possibly in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion, to help battle the virus and aid businesses.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Reuters) - A Washington state man in his 50s with underlying health issues became the United States’ first fatality from the coronavirus, officials said on Saturday, as the Trump administration stepped up efforts to combat the spread of the global outbreak.\nThe patient, who was chronically ill prior to contracting COVID-19, died at EvergreenHealth Hospital in Kirkland, near Seattle, and officials are unsure how he was exposed to the virus, said Jeffrey Duchin, head of the Washington health department’s communicable disease unit.\nThe state has recorded two other “presumptive” coronavirus cases at a long-term care facility in Kirkland where more than 50 residents and staff could be showing symptoms, he said.\n“At this point we do not have widespread community-wide transmission locally. We have transmission that’s associated with an outbreak at this long-term care facility,” Duchin said.\nThe two cases at the Kirkland facility were a health care worker in her 40s who is in satisfactory condition, and a woman in her 70s who lived there and is in serious condition.\n“It is a sad day as we learn a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to his family and friends,” the state’s governor, Jay Inslee, said in a statement. “We are strengthening our preparedness and response efforts to keep Washingtonians healthy, safe and informed.”\nThe first U.S. coronavirus death capped a week of stock market upheaval and escalating concern among state and federal health officials as the virus has spread across 46 countries and infected more than 60 people in the United States.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said lawmakers would take up a coronavirus spending bill next week “to advance a strong emergency funding supplemental package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis”.\nMost of the U.S. cases have occurred in travelers who were repatriated from China, where the virus originated.\nBut public health officials have also identified coronavirus cases in California, Washington and Oregon with no direct ties to the virus’ source in China, signaling a turning point in strategies needed to contain the disease in the United States.\nU.S. health authorities say it means the respiratory disease that has infected nearly 80,000 people worldwide and killed more than 2,800 in China is no longer an imported phenomenon but has taken up residence in the United States.\nGRAPHIC: Tracking the novel coronavirus - here\n“We still judge the general risk to the American public to be low and that includes residents of long-term care facilities,” Nancy Messonier, head of the Immunization and Respiratory Disease division at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), told reporters in a call on Saturday.\nMessonnier said the agency would send teams to support investigations in California and Washington into how patients contracted the virus and help trace who else may have been exposed.\nReuters graphics on the new coronavirus: here\nPERSON-TO-PERSON TRANSMISSION\nUntil this week, the CDC had counted just 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the U.S. public health system since Jan. 21. Most were contracted by individuals while traveling in China. Only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples.\nAn additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan or from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the supposed epicenter of the outbreak, according to the CDC.\nHealth officials said the advent of locally transmitted infections means authorities need to expand their focus from detecting a relatively limited number of cases, identifying close contacts and isolating them, to one that also emphasizes greater prevention among the public at large.\nIn particular, individuals should be more vigilant about basic hygiene measures, such as washing hands often, avoiding touching their faces, covering coughs and sneezes and staying home from school or work whenever ill, health officials say.\nCoronavirus is spread primarily through tiny droplets coughed or sneezed directly from an infected person into the face of someone nearby, as opposed to the more contagious “airborne” transmission of a virus like measles, which can remain suspended in enclosed spaces and be breathed in hours after being exhaled by sick individuals, experts say.\nCoronavirus can also survive on surfaces, such as handrails and door knobs, for “a very long period of time,” and be picked up by hand that way, though the virus is “very susceptible” to cleaning products, Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, said on Friday in Santa Clara County.\nStill, “It’s mostly a person-to-person transmission that we are concerned about for our communities,” he added.\nFor the online coverage of the coronavirus outbreak click, here\n",

There have been 26 deaths.\nA member of a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, known as Patient 31, was the first of a wave of infections to hit the country in recent weeks. The church’s suspected role in the outbreak has caused significant public anger.\nLee Man-hee, a self-proclaimed messiah who founded and heads the church, said it tried to prevent the spread of the virus among its members.\n“We did our best but were not able to stop the spread of the virus,” Lee told a news conference outside a church facility in Gapyeong, northeast of Seoul.\n“I’m really grateful, but at the same time asking forgiveness. I never thought this would happen, even in my dreams,” he told reporters, bowing low twice in a traditional sign of humility and regret.\nSeveral protesters shouted slurs at the reclusive leader, who spoke a day after the Seoul city government asked prosecutors to begin a murder investigation into him.\nSeoul said the church was liable for its refusal to cooperate with efforts to stop the disease.\nThe secretive church faces unprecedented scrutiny from authorities and the public, with all of its 310,000 known followers and “trainees” being tested for the virus.\nA church spokesman showed documents saying Lee tested negative for the virus.\nLee said many people had “misunderstandings” about the church, but did not elaborate.\nThe church issued a statement late on Sunday saying it was complying with government measures and reiterating calls for an end to “stigmatization, hatred and slander” against its followers.\n“Our priority is to cooperate with authorities to combat the coronavirus as soon as possible,” a church official told reporters after the news conference.\nTensions simmered ahead of the briefing outside the fortress-like venue, dubbed the Palace of Peace, which was guarded by hundreds of police officers.\nThe church had initially sought to hold the event inside the compound, known as a training institute for its members, but local authorities rejected the plan citing virus concerns.\nA note was posted on the gate of the compound saying it had been sealed off on Feb. 24. There was also a “beware the lion” sign.\nLee Yeon-woo, 54, held a tearful vigil outside, saying she had not heard from her daughter since she joined the church six years ago.\nSome former church members told Reuters that many young believers were forced to leave home and live in dormitories near the church as part of initiation, breaking ties with their families.\n“Shincheonji destroys families and separates children from their parents,” said Lee Yeon-woo. “I can’t sleep at night thinking my daughter might have been infected and is groaning with pain in seclusion.”\nGovernment officials warned of a “critical moment” in early March in South Korea’s battle with the largest virus outbreak outside China, urging South Koreans to minimize travel and avoid gatherings.\nThe education ministry said it will postpone the start of all schools’ new semester by two weeks to March 23.\n“Two weeks are essential for the coronavirus outbreak to ease,” minister Yoo Eun-hae told a briefing.\nOf the new 464 cases reported earlier on Monday by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), 377 were from the southeastern city of Daegu, home to a Shincheonji branch where Patient 31 had attended services.\nKCDC said some members of the Shincheonji church in January visited the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the disease emerged late last year, though it was investigating to determine whether that played a role in the outbreak.\nA church official said their own survey showed no one had gone to Wuhan since December, though there were 357 followers there.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Two South African citizens working on a Japanese cruise ship have tested positive for the Covid-19 virus, known as the coronavirus, the health ministry said on Friday.\n\"The South African government has been made aware by Japanese authorities through the South African embassy in Tokyo, that there were 12 South African crew members working on board the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship when it was affected by Covid-19.\n\"On 25 February 2020, we were informed by the Japanese authorities that two of these South Africans tested positive for Covid-19. They are currently being treated in Japan and the latest reports indicate that they are currently asymptomatic,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\"At this stage, it is most appropriate that the Covid-19 confirmed South African citizens should be treated in Japan until they are fully recovered from the virus and are no longer contagious before they travel further.\n\"For the remaining 10, they will be permitted to disembark the ship as per the instructions of their employer after they test negative for coronavirus, be subjected to a further 14-day quarantine in Japan, then further tested thereafter to determine if they may be cleared for travel.\n\"South Africa will continue to monitor the situation closely and maintain contact with the government of Japan in order to keep the public informed.\"\nDisembarkation in a phased approach\nThe cruise ship arrived in the Japanese Port of Yokohama with 3 700 people on board. On February 1, it was announced that a patient who had disembarked in Hong Kong on January 25 had tested positive for the coronavirus.\nThis led to a quarantine period on board the ship that ended on February 19. It was only at then that the South African government was informed of the situation.\nREAD | Coronavirus: Do you need a mask? Spoilers, the answer is no\nAccording to the ministry, passengers and crew on board are being tested for the coronavirus. To date, 705 have tested positive and these patients have been transferred off the ship for medical assistance.\n\"The disembarkation process of unaffected passengers has been a phased approach whereby passengers are released after testing negative for Covid-19. The ship company has indicated that the disembarkation of passengers is a priority and that crew members will be allowed to disembark after all passengers have disembarked,\" the ministry said.\nOn Friday, Nigeria announced the first confirmed case in sub-Saharan Africa, AFP reported.\nThe affected person is an Italian citizen who works in Nigeria and returned from Milan earlier this week, Health Minister Osagie Ehanire said in a statement on Twitter.\n\"The patient is clinically stable, with no serious symptoms, and is being managed at the Infectious Disease Hospital in Yaba, Lagos,\" Ehanire said.\nSouth Africans in Wuhan\nThe South African government is planning to repatriate all South Africans from the Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus originated.\nCovid-19 was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, in November 2019.\nIt was estimated that there were 199 South Africans in Wuhan, according to the Department of International Relations and Cooperation.\n\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Corona disaster and music on the Internet-- how does that fit together? A few weeks ago, at the beginning of the crisis, what began to be half funny with debilitating video clips has long since changed: appeals, warnings, grief and solidarity dissolve Jux and irony.\nLUSTIC ACCEPTANCE: THE HIT-PARODY \"MY CORONA\"\nAbout 40 years ago the rock band The Knack with \"My Sharona\" had a world hit, the song is still fascinating. This is what the American doctor Zubin Damania thought, who parodied the song at the end of February with \"My Corona\". As a rap comedian he calls himself ZDoggMD, the virus only localizes in the middle kingdom (\"My little Wuhan one\"), jumps around on the Chinese wall in the video, but at least advises to wash your hands. A good 1,6 million times, the meanwhile rather marginal piece of hardware was clicked on Youtube within four weeks.\nWHEN IRONIE NEVER PASSED: \"I CAN'T GET NO DISINFECTION\"\nDisinfectants were quickly scarce, as the danger of the new Coronavirus caused more and more people in Germany. TV images of empty supermarket shelves led jokers at RBB radio stations to ironically translate Oldies of Rolling Stones (\"I Can't Get No Satisfaction\") and Beatles (\"With A Little Help From My Friends\") for their fun video. The result: a whimsical mix of \"I Can't Get No Disinfection\" and \"Some Spray for My Hands\" for the makers \"The Song of Disease!\"\nFRESH WARNING FROM SINGAPUR: \"FIGHT THE VIRUS\"\nEntertainer Alvin Oon from Singapore warned musically about the new virus at the end of January. He took on the popular \"Sound of Silence\" of the US duo Simon & Garfunkel and made it \"Fight the Virus\". Meanwhile, this version on YouTube has over 700 000 calls and a lot of audi\" Together we must overcome/To beat this virus fight as one- the impressive video and the new text clearly set on community feeling against the danger and emphasize in the end: \"We will win the fight.\"\nNot just for football fans: \"You'LL NEVER WALK ALONE\"\nThis cult song by supporters of FC Liverpool and many other (currently giving) football fans was played in March by radio stations across Europe as a sign of solidarity in Corona times. This was immediately reflected in the music downloads: The classic of Gerry & The Pacemakers of the 1963 year came up to six of the German single download charts, where other songs with crisis-related references were listed: \"Corona World Ending\" by the South Tyrolean rock band Frei. Wild or John Lennon's \"Imagine\".\nBERLINER DAHEIM-HYMNE: \"We're not going after the road\"\n78-year-old, the Berlin singer and entertainer Frank Zander is part of the Coronavirus risk group, as he himself says. But it's understandable to the skilled charity man that he cares for everyone else. After the melody of Rod Stewart's world hit \"Sailing\", he has now rewritten his Hertha BSC stadium hymn \"Let's Not Go Home\". Finally, in the Daheim video, fun-maker Frankie says: \"Stay at home. It's really serious this time.\"\nNEW TEXT FROM THE HOMEOFFICE: \"NOT STRONGER THAN NOW\"\nGerman pop star Max Giesinger has rewritten his February single \"Never better than now\" to \"Never stronger than now\". He does not believe that musicians with such Corona actions from the home office also aim at higher streaming rates. \"At the moment, a singer would have to do a duet with Capital Bra or other rappers if he wanted to,\" said Giesinger of the German Press Agency. \"I rather see it as being able to do good and use its platformYeah. The money is donated and the text may give people a positive feeling.\"\nSEUCHEN SONGS FOR ROCKFANS: FROM MINUTES AT SPRINGSTEPS\nMany radio stations and music magazines cannot miss the chance to make their own hit list of anti-plague songs. For example, \"Rock Antenne\" from Ismaning near Munich with its special \"The Ten Best Rock Songs...against the Corona Virus\". The radio experts recommend \"to kick the virus in the ass\" songs from Minutemen \"Corona\" and Iron Maiden (Virus) to R.E.M (It's The End of The World...) and Bad Religion (Infected) to Bruce Springsteen (Fever).\nANTI-CORONA-HIT WITH PUTIN CRITICAL: \"SITZ ZUHAUSE\"\nIn the Russian-speaking Internet community, the singer Brandon Stone (39) is known as The Voice of Germany. He composed a Corona song with Latin rhythms and rap. \"Headquarters at home. And don't get sick\"or\"Corona, get out of it\", so he sings in Russian. The Georgian-born artist Tiflis, a bourgeois Bessik Schpetischwili, has also installed a Polit Schlenker with criticism of Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin. It is precisely by amending the Constitution that it will be possible to ensure that it remains in power. And Brandon Stone asks, \"What's this for?\" \"\nNOT CLASSICAL: ITALIAN AS NABUCCO CHOR\nThousands of deaths have already claimed the Coronavirus in Italy, more are happening every day. In a video shot ten thousand times in a short time, countless people in the isolation of their homes form the prison choir of Giuseppe Verdi's opera Nabucco, singing tribute to the dead, the sick and the helpers. At the end, the flag of Italy blows. The freedom anthem \"Va, pensiero\" (Flight, Thought): a moving document of the will to persevere and probably the most valuable musical contribution to crisis management. (dpa",

Thus, the European economy will suffer from the economic shock in China in the first quarter, there will be supply bottlenecks for the European and global economies, demand will also be dampened across Europe and globally, and liquidity bottlenecks for businesses are to be expected.\nStrictly speaking, the Covid-19 crisis will have a very large negative impact on the economy in the EU and the euro area, the Commission estimates. 2021 The economy will experience a substantial but not complete recovery. However, some of the direct negative consequences could be mitigated by swift and effective counter-measures taken by the EU and the Member States, according to an analysis by the Commission.\nThe EU Commission is planning a comprehensive package for this. This includes not only the generous interpretation of the debt and deficit rules in the Stability and Growth Pact, but also the aid rules.

        "news_content_translate_en": "It was only in the financial markets that the worry about the Coronavirus was lifted, but that is now over. Stock prices collapsed at the beginning of the week, oil prices declined. On the other hand, investments such as gold and government bonds, considered as a \"safe haven\" in times of crisis, were needed. The reason for the turbulence: the number of infected has increased significantly over the weekend in Italy, the number of deaths caused by the virus has risen sharply in China and South Korea is also increasingly affected.\n\"It is clear that the economic consequences of the Corona epidemic will be significant,\" commented Michael Bissinger, an expert at DZ Bank. Damage caused by production failures, disrupted supply chains, limited consumption possibilities and travel failures are already considerable, especially for China and the Asian neighbouring states.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has already lowered its growth forecasts for China, and according to Unicredit chief economist Erik Nielsen, the country's economy is expected to grow by only three percent in the first quarter, after around six percent at the end of 2019. Given China's recent sharply increased importance for the global economy, the expert said, this will have a corresponding impact on the global economy.\nWith regard to Germany, economists of leading German financial institutions assume that the epidemic could delay a recovery. China is an important trading partner of Germany. For the automakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen, the empire of the middle is the most important single market. In addition, there were temporary production stoppages, although BMW and Daimler were now able to restart their production in China and Volkswagen announced on Monday that they had resumed operations of most of the plantsYeah.\nIndustry expert Ferdinand DudenHofer expects a decrease in production by two,7 million vehicles worldwide compared to the previous year. The German car industry was particularly affected by the high share of 35-percent of total sales in China.\nThe Federal Association of German Industry (BDI) also warns of possible effects of the virus on the economy and calls on politics to act. \"In addition to health protection, politics must now focus on economic crisis management,\" said BDI chief executive Joachim Lang. \"The federal government must now provide economic policy impulses to boost growth as quickly as possible.\" Purchase, production and sales are severely restricted.\nIf production in Chinese factories is prolonged because they remain closed because of the virus, their customers will also be put at risk. Apple, for example, recently collected its revenue forecast for the current quarter due to supply shortages on iPhones due to the Coronavirus. On Monday, the British mixed group AB Foods also warned of the impact on its Primark textile chain. In Germany, according to BDI, the electrical, automotive, pharmaceutical and paper industries are expecting, among other things, bottlenecks in supplies from the Far East.\nAn additional problem, according to expert Nielsen, is that central banks cannot respond to such supply shocks. The money-keepers can try to boost the purchasing momentum of businesses and consumers, for example, with cheap money. But if there is simply little or nothing to buy, it is of no use.\nIf less is produced, less must be transported. This is the first thing that logistics companies and airlines will feel. In addition to the German car builders'papers, their shares were among the biggest losers at the start of the weekYeah. For the German index Dax, up to the afternoon the total was almost four percent downward. In the rest of Europe as well as in Asia, the Dow Jones stock index also went downhill and lost about three percent to the trade-off on the US stock exchanges.\nPapers from the luxury industry were also under pressure because a large part of the turnover here is based on purchases of tourists. According to a study by the consulting company Boston Consulting Group (BCG) on the Coronavirus, the luxury goods industry expects to face billions in revenue and profits.\nThe economic fears also pushed oil prices. After all, if economic activity and travel activities are halted, the already existing oversupply on the oil market will be even greater, explains raw material expert Carsten Fritsch from the Commerzbank. On the other hand, the installations considered to be safe ports were in demand. Government bonds increased sharply, their yields fell in return. The gold price rose to a seven-year high, approached the brand of 1700 US dollars per fine ounce (31,1 grams) and even reached a record of 1561 euro converted into euro",

The most common questions and answers to the novel corona virus, Covid-19 lung disease and recommended precautions.\nWho is particularly at risk?\nThe chairman of the Bremen Association of Physicians, Hans-Michael Muhlenfeld, particularly mentions these risk groups: \"In the first place, people with lung disease COPD and asthma are at risk, they are, in my opinion, the most important group. The second group includes patients with heart failure, called heart failure. Elderly people are also at risk, as well as chronically ill people in general.\"The Bremer Hausphysician said that they should avoid human accumulation as much as possible. This also applied to bus and train. Millfield: \"If you have to go shopping in the supermarket yourself, you should do so when there is little operation.\"\nHow is the Coronavirus transmitted?\nAccording to the Berlin Robert-Koch Institute (RKI), Sars-CoV-2's main route of transmission is drip infection. This could be done directly from person to person through the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract or indirectly through hands that are then brought into contact with the mucous membranes of the mouth or nose and the conjunctiva. \"There have also been cases where people who had shown only mild or unspecific symptoms have become infected,\" the RKI website says. The new Coronaviruses were also found in stool samples of some affected. Whether Sars-CoV-2 can also be disseminated faecally-oral, but is not yet finaliseYeah.\nWhat symptoms does the Coronavirus cause?\nAccording to RKI, an infection with the new type of corona virus, like other respiratory agents, can lead to symptoms such as cough, flu, throat cramps and fever, some people also suffered from diarrhoea. \"In the cases reported so far mainly from China, four out of five cases were mild. In some patients, the virus may lead to a more severe course of respiratory problems and pneumonia,\"the RKI reports.\nWhat do you do if you suspect you're infected?\n\"Under no circumstances should you go directly to a doctor or hospital. Because there is a great danger that you can infect other people,\"says the Bremer Hausdoctor Millfield. The Robert Koch Institute in Berlin also recommends that those who have had contact with people who have already been infected should report to the health service regardless of the occurrence of symptoms. Doctors and officials may order a laboratory examination if Sars-CoV-2 is suspected. According to RKI, those who have reasonable suspicions of being infected should avoid unnecessary contacts, not go to work and stay at home.\nPeople suffering from suspected colds such as coughing should also avoid contact with others, stressed Millfield. Covid-19 symptoms may also be milder and may therefore not be recognised or associated with the Coronavirus. \"There is still a risk of infection for others, including influenza.\"\nWhat about travelers who return?\n\"People who have stayed in a risk area identified by the ICRC should avoid unnecessary contact and stay at home wherever possible, regardless of symptomsYeah. When acute respiratory symptoms occur, they should observe the cough and sneezing labels as well as good hand hygiene and, after phone call with travel information, see a doctor,\"it says on the website of the Robert Koch Institute.\nFor travellers from regions where Covid-19 cases occur but which are not at risk, if you develop fever, cough or shortness of breath within a 14-day period following your return journey, you should see a doctor after a telephone call and with a reference to the journey. In addition, unnecessary contacts should be avoided.\nHow dangerous is the virus?\nAccording to the Robert Koch Institute, insufficient data are currently available for a final assessment of the severity of the new respiratory disease. Until now, deaths have occurred mainly in patients who were older and/or had chronic underlying diseases.\nAccording to a recent analysis presented by the Chinese health authority, a 2,3 percent of those infected with Sars-CoV-2 are dying in the country. According to RKI, the death rate for people over eighty years is approximately fifteen per cent calculated from the data available there, so in this age group in China, about 15 per cent of infected people die. In the group of ten to 39-year-old people then die 0,2 percent of the infected, i.e. about two out of 1000 affected. Experts believe that mortality is actually lower than estimated in China, partly because many mild-acting infections are not included in Chinese statistics.\nHow can you protect yourself from infection?\nIn order to protect against these and other viruses, experts recommend common hygiene measures, which are also explicitly mentioned each year during the flu seasonYeah. \"The most important and effective measures for personal protection as well as for the protection of others from infection with respiratory tract infections are good hand hygiene, a correct cough and sneeze label and the distance (about one to two meters) of potentially ill people,\" stresses the Bremer Hausdoctor. disposable handkerchiefs should be discarded after use.\nProtective masks are unnecessary for health, says Oliver Witzke, Director of the University Medical Infectiology Clinic Essen. According to RKI, there is insufficient evidence that wearing a mouth-nose protection reduces the risk of infection for a healthy person wearing it. However, a mask may be helpful for people who are ill: \"If a person suffering from an acute respiratory infection has to move in public space, wearing a mouth-nose guard by that person may be useful to reduce the risk of other people being infected by droplets, which arise during coughing or sneezing\", it says on the website of the Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA).\nHow is Covid-19 treated?\nThere is no special treatment for Covid-19 disease. \"The focus of the treatment of the infection is on optimum support measures corresponding to the severity of the disease, such as oxygen, fluid balance, where appropriate, antibiotic agave for the treatment of bacterial alternative or concomitant infections and for the treatment of relevant underlying diseases, it shall be stated on the RKI website.\nIs there a vaccine?\nNo vaccine is currently available. According to media reports, a first vaccine candidate is to be tested in a clinical trial in China by the end of April. When a vaccine might be available is not currently foreseeablYeah.\nIs it possible to infect yourself with goods or foodstuffs from a risk area?\nInfection with the novel corona virus over surfaces is considered unlikely. This applies to food as well as to toys or other goods. For example, fruit from northern Italy could continue to be bought and consumed without any hesitation, said Professor Lars Schaade of the RKI.\nThe WHO believes that the agent Sars-CoV-2 can survive on surfaces for several days. According to the Federal Centre for Health Education, however, no case of transmission via uninhabited surfaces has been documented so far. Regular and thorough hand washing is nevertheless important, especially as it is also the best protection against direct virus transmission from person to person, in coronavirus as well as in flu.\nHow does the Coronavirus test work?\nWhen Sars-CoV-2 is suspected, the pathogen is usually detected by a molecular biology test. First, a doctor takes a sample from the respiratory tract of a patient, a swab or cough mucus. Specialists then prepare this sample in the laboratory and search for the genetic material of the virus with a PCR test. Simply put, a certain section of the viral heritage is copied into millions. The copies are marked in colour with a so-called probe. This colour marking can be made visible with complex devices. In ideal conditions, such a test lasts three to five hours in a specialised laboratory, where appropriate colour signals are present.\nWhy do contacts have to be quarantined for 14 days?\n14-days correspond to the maximum duration of the incubation period. According to current knowledge, there is no longer any risk of infection.\nWhere can I find out?\nAmong others on the following websites:www.rki.de (Robert Koch-Institut)\nwww.federal health ministrde\nwww.gesundheitsamt.bremen.de\nwww.niedersachsen.de/coronavirus\nThe Federal Ministry of Health has also established a Coronavirus hotline:\n030'8201;/'8201; 346'8201; 46'8201; 51'8201; 00 and 08'8201; 00/'8201; 011'8201; 77'8201; 22\nThere is also a telephone consultation at the Bremen Health Office:\n04-8201; 21-8201;/- 8201; 36-8201; 11-8201; 51-8201; 1",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Consultant of the director of scientific work of the Central Institute of epidemiology of the Russian Federal Health Supervision Bureau, and expert of the director of Moscow infectious clinical hospital No.2, In an interview with Russian news agency, academician Victor maleyev talked about the situation of Russia's containment of kronaveros, that is, children are often infected by adults to their bodies when they need to see a doctor. Why, despite the spread of covid-19, are private laboratories allowed to test for coronavirus and vaccinate against other infections? Said Lyudmila belonoco.\n-Victor vasiliyevich, new cases of coronavirus infection continue to increase in Russia. Most still prevalent diseases or infections begin to spread in the country?\nYes, we see more new things. However, we note that about 90% of cases are imported from other countries, although those who do not comply with the quarantine regulations from abroad also start to spread in Russia. This has happened.\n-Unfortunately, it was learned on Wednesday that two patients with positive coronavirus died in Moscow. Why don't you save them?\n-Yes, I'm sorry, it's true. These are 88 and 73 year olds with related diseases, including cardiovascular diseaseAbout Therefore, it must be pointed out that the elderly are in danger and it is better to stay at home and not go to public places.\n-From March 27, Russia effectively stopped air contact with other countries. Will this help stop the spread of Colorado virus in Russia?\nIt should be noted that more than 20000 of our citizens plan to return to China, and they will return within 3-5 days. They will only arrive through one point, they will be quarantined immediately, so I hope the infection will not spread seriously, but these people have potential risks, Because they can cause coronavirus infection, we must be very careful and take measures when they come. In general, the suspension of air traffic should certainly help reduce the number of new cases of coronavirus infection.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has announced that he will not work at all next week. Do you think this will help reduce the number of new cases of Colorado virus in one week?\nYes, of course, this is a very correct measure to control the spread of infection. Restrictive measures to isolate people - this is very important now. It's hard to say how long it will take - a week or more, especially, as I said earlier, to know that there are still tourists coming from abroadAbout Therefore, we are taking further measures.\nWeekends will help significantly reduce the number of new cases, but they cannot disappear completely. The possibility of infection remains, but growth must be reduced.\n-Several private laboratories have begun to offer Russians the chance to pass corona charging tests, even without symptoms. Does it make sense for healthy people to do such tests?\n-It provides an opportunity for private laboratories to conduct coronavirus tests so that people have more opportunities to check their health. It's more like a therapeutic self soothing measure, because the decision to do a coronary examination or not should be a doctor rather than the patient themselves, especially if there are no symptoms. Before you go to check for the flu, you are ill. When you go to the doctor, you have symptoms. Therefore, if you feel sick, it's best to see a doctor, who can decide whether you need this diagnosis.\nIt doesn't make sense to test everyone in any age group. Humans have almost never made any other diagnosis, if not any proper symptoms. This should be the same. In particular, if you check out the Colorado virus, it has to be done every dayAbout For example, a person passed the test but didn't find the Colorado virus, but when he left the lab, he was caught, so the doctor had to determine if a test was needed.\nAsymptomatic people, if there is a risk of infidelity, if there is a relative infection, can be tested. Then, even if there is no sign that he needs to be examined. Another option is if a person has a chronic disease, but only the doctor can decide what diagnosis to make.\n-Is body temperature 37 a reason to call a doctor and suspect that you have a coronavirus?\nTemperature over 37 is a reason to see a doctor. But that doesn't mean a person has a coronavirus infection. You know, there are some pathologists whose body temperature is 37.1, for example, it may be common, and the exact symptoms are not coronavirus. Therefore, it is recommended that doctors look at the whole situation and evaluate all symptoms of patients.\n-Can coronavirus infection be completely asymptomatic? How many coronaviruses live in a person's system?\nWe don't know, even with symptoms. Scientists haven't found out yet. We have seen that even with human release, some people say it may be reinfected, but it may not be a repeat, but a recurrence, that is, the virus is not released from the bodyAbout Therefore, Chinese colleagues have also observed them for a period of time after discharge. We should do the same thing to prevent further infection.\nAlthough we now have a mandatory one-day test before the patient leaves the hospital, because the virus is new, no one knows how it works. There is not much data on this issue.\n-Now many people say that children can carry coronavirus. is that true? Can children now be vaccinated against other infectious diseases, or will this weaken the immune system?\n-Now there are data that, on the contrary, children are infected by adults, not transmitted infections. You know, if we look at who's coming back from other countries, they're mostly adults, not children, but they have coronavirus in their children.\nAs for vaccination, on the one hand, it does not hinder the other. Vaccination is possible, but children must be checked before vaccination to ensure that they do not have a fever. Of course, if he is abroad, he should be checked for the presence of coronavirus before being immunized. If the child doesn't go anywhere, not in Moscow, but there are no cases of coronavirus, then vaccination should be carried outAbout\n-Sometimes it is suggested that voluntary doctors should be infected with coronavirus to cure their diseases, because they will develop immunity, Then they can work quietly. Is this possible?\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has the same idea. Of course, this is not reasonable, and there is no need to do so. Everyone should protect themselves, wear masks and gloves. We see fatal situations, so it's better to protect ourselves rather than intentionally take risks.\n-Is it necessary to carry out Russian quarantine now?\n-It should be said that restrictive measures are everywhere. In big cities, it is important to ensure that people do not break the self closed system and deal with it case by case. Monitoring of medical staff and employers is recommended. In some areas, both the police and the police are involved. Verification must be carried out from all aspects.\nWhen can we expect a drop in infection rates in Russia?\nWe haven't reached the peak yet. There is a risk that those who come back from abroad will cause infection. You can't say it's going to be a recession. We have to watch, we have to monitor that. I don't rule out the increase of new cases in the future, but later it stabilized and began to calm down slowly. Now we can see that even in Italy, the infection rate has decreased. China has lifted some restrictionAbout Infection has certain limitations, cycle. At some stage, it's over, and we hope, in Russia, it'll be over soon",

        "news_content_translate_en": "After the US issued restrictions on Chinese state media, China ordered the expulsion of several US journalists in return. Employees of leading US media houses such as the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post are affected.\nEmployees of these newspapers, whose accreditations expired before the end of the year, would have to return their press credentials within ten days. That's what the Chinese Foreign Office announced on Tuesday. Because journalists'visas are linked to their press credentials, this is tantamount to expulsion. Those affected may also no longer enter the Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Zones.\nThe newspapers concerned condemned the measure. It was \"particularly irresponsible at a time when the world needs the free and open flow of credible information about the Coronavirus pandemic,\" wrote New York Times editor Dean Baquet. Similarly, the leading editor of the Wall Street Journal said: \"Confidential news and China were never more important.\" The expulsion was an \"attack on freedom of the press\". The chief editor of the Washington Post, Marty Barton, said the measure would \"only make things worse\".\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also criticised the move.\" I hope they will reconsider,\"he said. Compared to previous measures in the USA, freedom of the press is not restricted there. Journalists cannot be equated with propagandists. China, on the other hand, denied the world access to what was happening in the country, Pompeo said. Transparency, especially in times of crisis, was more important to the people of China than ever.\nIn early March, the US had adopted new restrictions on Chinese state media outletYeah. The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs set a maximum limit of 100 accredited employees for five Chinese press houses, including the state news agency Xinhua. Previously, this limit was at 160.\nIn addition, the US government is considering tightening visa restrictions for Chinese journalists in the future. When announcing the Chinese counter-measures on Tuesday, the Beijing Foreign Office called the US restrictions \"scandalous\", Chinese media were \"suppressed\" in the US.\nPreviously, the US had classified China's state media as \"foreign representations\". They were organs of the Communist leadership. The move would require five media companies, whose status now resembles that of embassies, to adjust to more frequent controls, the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced in February. Among other things, the media concerned in the US must report the names of their employees, ownership and personnel changes. The same restrictions now apply in China to the US newspapers concerned.\nThe quarrel could be caused by the expulsion of three Wall Street Journal correspondents for reporting on the outbreak of the new Coronavirus. The paper did not want to apologize for an opinion entitled \"China is the real sick man of Asia\". It was the first time in the recent history of the People's Republic that several correspondents of an international news organization of the country were immediately expelled.\nHowever, tensions between China and the US have recently escalated. Thus, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticised US President Donald Trump. This had called the new Coronavirus \"Chinese virus\" several times. The link between the pathogen and China is outrageous and amounts to stigmatisation, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Office said.\nHowever, Trump insists on this designation for Sars-CoV-2.\" It came from ChinYeah. That is why I think the term is very precise,\"said Trump at a White House press conference. It was not this name that was stigmatising, but alleged claims by the Beijing leadership that the virus had been brought to China by the US Army.\nA statement to this effect came earlier from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a spokesman for the authority speculated on Twitter. He \"did not appreciate\" this conspiracy theory, Trump said",

        "news_content_translate_en": "COVID-19 Russian citizens sat down for quarantine in March, but the reasons and timing of the current situation still exist with regard to new Colorado. About why the world started to panic because of a weaker virus than Ebola and flu, Russia is 1-2 weeks behind in the virus calendar, with an artificial origin of 2019 ncov, and According to Russia News Agency reporter Natalia paramonov (US), Professor of GMU School of systems biology ancha baranova, how long will the pandemic last.\n-If, according to doctors, there will be a similar epidemic, or even a pandemic, then why can't the medical system deal with the coronavirus?\nWe can predict the number of people in need of medical assistance during the flu season. Depending on the activity of the season, the doctor's workload may vary. Two years ago, for example, the United States was a very active flu season, with hospitals full. However, for influenza, we predict how many people will have lung disease, how many people will have fever at home, how many people will go to the hospital, and how many people will die. In the United States, for example, the number of deaths due to seasonal influenza is about 16000. It's not a small number, it's more deaths than Colorado, but it's a forecastAbout It should be noted that deaths are not only the result of the flu itself, but also the result of delays, that is, estimates.\nIn the case of coronavirus, because people can infect each other in the asymptomatic stage of the disease, the infection spreads rapidly, As a result, the number of people infected has grown much faster than the flu. What we can do now is to predict the future and how many people will be infected. This prediction is based on the dynamics of Italy, China and other countries.\nDoctors created a so-called virus calendar. The situation in Italy as a country too late to act is a starting point. The beginning of the calendar was the first day of discovery. According to the virus calendar, the United States is now March 6, Russia February 28. Compared with the rest of the world, Russia has a very good position. The epidemic curve here has been delayed and Russia is 1-2 weeks behind. No one wants the Italian plot to develop. Countries are trying to prevent this from developing by extending the epidemic over time.\nThis delay is necessary for two reasons. First of all, because there is a good opportunity, the burden of diseases caused by viruses will decrease over time, because viruses develop in a more adaptive direction. New owneAbout Second, because this figure is not taken into account in the health systems of all countries. When the number of planned influenza patients and ozone depleting substance patients plus the number of unplanned coronavirus patients, the total number is too much. Beds for such infectious diseases, especially emergency beds, shall not be used by people who need first aid. I'm not talking about planned surgery, but about estimates of deaths from strokes, heart attacks and traffic accidents, and cancer patients.\nAll health systems operate according to certain computational models. No society can maintain 100 times the number of beds, which is really needed. It is also well known that there is a small amount of reserves depending on the country, and understandably when all reserves are exhausted. Therefore, all strategies to combat coronavirus involve how to expand the scope of the epidemic and make it unclear in time. Make sure that fewer people get sick every day, that they can cope with it and that they can be treated.\nIn the United States, we were initially told to be alone for two weeks, but at least until the summer, we are likely to be besieged. But everything will be OK, I'm going to the store, I'm going to the toilet paper, too.\n-There's a lot of talk about whether the death rate of new viruses is high or loAbout What do you believe?\n-Mortality. Now we really can't call him. In China, 2% of deaths occur in countries with a relatively young population structure. In addition, China has successfully treated the problem nationwide. The situation is different in Italy. There are more deaths, because there are more old people, more serious situations. To make matters worse, Italy's medical system has collapsed, so rations must be brought into the process. So they had a lung fan and two patients aged 40 and 80. They like to give fans 40 years old because he has the chance to recover in a few days. This causes moral problems, but only in this way can these problems be solved.\nEbola is more dangerous than Colorado, but the country is not segregated?\n-The whole fear of coronaveros is that his mortality rate is not very high. Ebola's mortality and disease are almost always very serious. In Ebola, you just lie there and you don't spread the virus. Viruses limit themselves. No one will pass him on to his neighbors, let alone other continents, and no one will treat patients rationally. In many cases, the flow of coronavirus is easy, so it spreads.\nColorado virus already exists: SARS in 2003, mers in 2012, and 35% of deathsAbout That's why he was quickly weakened. The man was suddenly ill. To be exact, he could not go anywhere. The disease here is often mild, so people separate it.\nDo you think it's a media issue?\nIt's not about the media, it's about the public. The decision is based on a large number of statistics on diseases and resources. At the global level, it is recommended that countries quarantine as much as possible.\nImpossible place?\nIn Mexico, for example, this is not possible. The incidence there is not too high for the time being, it will certainly be higher, but all the people there are happy and standing on their heads. In fact, in Mexico, there is a very uncontrolled area. In the poor areas of the country, the country does not have effective job opportunities, so people cannot be isolated there. This will be a natural development of epidemics.\nAlthough there's a Canadian in Mexico - it's hot. In any hot country, the spread of the virus is not very good, it soon dried up. Another thing is in the air-conditioned room, where he can stay for three days. Any virus is hot and dry in an hour's heat. It's true. Q: will she completely descend or will she come back? In order for the virus to dry quickly outdoors, the temperature must be over 30 degrees. At this temperature, RNA and DNA can damage the virusAbout\nThe more organized a country is, the better it can cope with the epidemic. For example, Germany did a good job. Take this country as an example. When a group appears to be immune to most people's viruses, the virus itself disappears. This is the end of the epidemic. Even if they do nothing, about 70% of them will return to health and the rest will not be infected basically. The epidemic is developing rapidly until none of the population is \"immune\".\nUnder this premise, countries have adopted three strategies. First of all, just like in Mexico, we do nothing, we wait for its development. Second, just like in Europe, the United States and Russia - get everyone quarantined, extend the epidemic. Britain chose a third strategy. They don't think they can protect everyone. Young people are still ill, so we will only isolate the old, which will save their virus. At the same time, young people's overfishing, access to immunity, up to 70%. The decision on which programme to adopt depends on national resources, population structure, economic structure and many other factors.\n-How do you comment on the theory that the United States brought Colorado Russia into China? Is it possible?\n-Sequel) reading sequence of genetic code. - about. The virus is well knownAbout This is a common natural virus, it is easy to mutate, which is normal. In December, the virus was released based on a survey of the first patients. We know his structure in December and his current structure. Even the Sikhs of December have shown no sign that the virus is man-made. You can usually see it. If scientists cut RNA or DNA, there are still traces of molecular scissors at the place of cutting, provided that. There may be some nucleotides, repeat sequences and other small signs. Like nature, we can't work yet.\nBesides, just want the virus on your head, it won't release. He needs a test. And it can't be tested on mice, they don't infect it. It is much more difficult to study in monkeys than in humans. The cost of monkeys is very expensive. We all calculate it. It's also incredible to imagine someone creating a pandemic in public where we don't know anything. How do they stop her? What is this, on the island? I mean, the logic of the plot doesn't work.\nIn an interview, you said you've been waiting for a virus from bats to humans. Why wait? Why are we not ready?\n-Bats have hundreds of viruses, each with its own Mice have a very strong immune system and are resistant to these virusesAbout It doesn't produce virus antibodies, they just learn how to co-exist with these viruses. People develop Speleology and tourists climb caves. Rats on top of them, all the viruses. A mouse virus will come sooner or later. In the past decade, these studies have been very active. Scientists specifically identified the varicose veins of bat virus. And in order to do this, they were not caught by the mice, but collected their derivatives.)（ Recover the virus sequence in the computer model. Because of this, we have a good knowledge base in all mice.\n-In addition to bats, what animals are dangerous viral vectors for humans?\n-Fish have virus, birds have a lot of virus. As we know, avian influenza may spread from avian influenza to human influenza, for example. But it should be said that the virus is still species, and often changes its owner in an animal group, so human beings wait to get despicable treatment from mammals in the first place. At least from the birds. From fish and insects, we don't expect anything powerful because our receptors are quite different from their cell receptors.\nIt is because the virus is waiting that China can respond so quickly to SARSAbout In this case, it should be said that scientists have done an excellent job: isolate the virus, determine its receptor, its affinity with other viruses, how its genes work, and its interaction with proteins. This work is carried out at a good level and fast.\n-Can I get sick again?\nThis is a very delicate question. At first, a patient was discharged from the hospital in Japan, and then tests showed that she had a coronavirus. Most likely, this is a wrong initial test, and the test is not perfect. Now data from China show that as many as 14 percent of those who are positive on discharge tests go home and sit at home, and then they do another test, which is positive. However, this may not mean reinfection, but rather that a person has been infected for a long time. I mean, the symptoms are over, the person seems to have recovered, he sits in quarantine for a week, and then he does two tests, both of which are negative, Then another test, it's positive. The number of such third affirmative tests cannot be ignored, so now Chinese patients should sit in quarantine stations instead of one week after recovery, but two. They should take three tests, and They should all be negative.\nSo far, it's not sure, but it may not be any more pollutionAbout The spread of the virus is slow and has great epidemiological impact, but it is not as large as reinfection.\n-Under what conditions will the epidemic stop?\nThis is two processes. One is the evolution of the virus. We know that in a new host - a person's new host's virus - is weakening. We see him in other viruses, including the coronavirus. Bat virus has entered the human body, and the transition from human to human is accompanied by the mutation of the virus, which often weakens the virus. The virus has evolved in unison, allowing it to coexist more or less with humans. The virus is adapting to us. How long it will take is not known. It's growing faster than hepatitis C, but not as fast as flu, it's evolving the fastest. This is the first process, the second is to obtain immunity, that is, natural vaccination",

The Center for Disease Control says on its website the virus had links to a \"seafood and live animal market\" where a human might have contracted the virus from an animal. The virus then spread person-to-person (  here  ). The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, tiredness, cough, and shortness of breath that can appear  two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus (  here  ). The coronavirus is spread person-to-person (  here  ).\nMobile phones use radio waves. They send and receive radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMFs). 5G uses \"beam-forming technology\", which allows radiofrequency electromagnetic fields to go directly where needed (  here  ).\nThe International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) after 7 years of research released 2020 guidelines on limiting exposure to electromagnetic fields. They include information about 5G.\nThe commission says the main effect that radiofrequency electromagnetic fields have on the human body is increased temperature of exposed tissue. The body can handle small increases to body temperature, such as through exercising, but radiofrequency exposure and increased temperature can be dangerous above a certain threshold (  here  ).\nAccording to the ICNIRP, \"Another general characteristic of RF EMFs is that the higher the frequency, the lower the depth of penetration of the EMFs into the body. As 5G technologies can utilize higher EMF frequencies (>24 GHz) in addition to those currently used (<4 GHz), power from those higher frequencies will be primarily absorbed more superficially than that from previous mobile telecommunications technologies […] Accordingly, 5G exposures will not cause any harm providing that they adhere to the ICNIRP (2020) guidelines\" (  here  ).\nEric van Rongen, Chairman of ICNIRP, said in a video that there is no evidence that electromagnetic fields cause health effects such as cancer, electrohypersensitivity, infertility or anything else. The only two recognized health effects are nerve stimulation in up to 10 MHz and heating from 100 kHz (  here  ).\nThe World Health Organization says no research has linked exposure to wireless technology with negative health effects (  here  ). WHO said on its website it will continue to review research in this area and is conducting a \"health risk assessment\" of all radiofrequency ranges that will be available in 2022.\nMarvin C. Ziskin, Professor Emeritus of Radiology and Medical Physics, said there is no basis to expect that 5G would cause adverse health issues provided exposure limits are respected.\nZiskin told Reuters, “The weight of scientific evidence indicates that 5G emissions are not cumulative. That is, multiple exposures of innocuous exposures do not add to produce any adverse biological effect. I would add that there have been no health agency warnings about possible health risks of RF energy including millimeter waves at exposure levels that an average consumer would experience from communications technology. This is consistent with assessments of the issue by standards-setting groups such as IEEE and ICNIRP.”\nCoronavirus symptoms can be found in detail on official government and international health organization sites. They bear no similarity to possible health effects stemming from mobile phone or 5G use.\nFalse: There is no connection between the outbreak of COVID-19 and possible 5G health effects.\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

The coronavirus had forced her to cancel plans to visit her parents in February, after the Lunar New Year.\n“I am so desperate to go back home now to see all of them there,” she said as she waited for her father to pick them up and drive to the family home in the nearby city of Huangshi.\nOn Wednesday evening in Xianning, residents strolled outside, carrying groceries or buying takeaway. Restaurants were only serving food for takeaway. Loudspeakers blared out promotions like buy one get one free. Everyone wore masks.\nThe lockdown of Hubei’s capital Wuhan will be lifted on April 8, a milestone in China’s war against the epidemic as Beijing shifts its focus toward stemming imported cases and rebooting the economy.\nIn Wuhan, there were also signs of normal life returning.

It’s urgent for all countries to strengthen international coordination in macro policies such as public health policy, trade policy, fiscal and monetary policy,” Chen said.\n“We will actively participate in international cooperation in response to challenges posed by the complex situation.”\nChen said that while downward pressure on the global economy is increasing as the virus rattles financial markets, he said he expects significant improvement in the Chinese economy in the second quarter.\nPrivate-sector analysts are slashing their growth forecasts for China to lows not seen since the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, with a sharp contraction expected in the first quarter.\n“At present, the operation of China’s financial market is generally stable, market expectations are relatively stable, and the space for macro policies and tool reserves are sufficient,” Chen said.\nThe PBOC will keep liquidity reasonably ample, keep growth of M2 money supply and total social financing in line with nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth and aim for slightly higher credit rise, Chen added.\nThe PBOC has already rolled out a raft of measures, including cutting lending rates and banks’ reserve ratios, and doling out cheap loans for selected firms, to cushion the blow to the economy from the coronavirus outbreak.\nChina, where the virus outbreak originated late last year in the central city of Wuhan, is widely expected to see its economy contract in the first quarter due to efforts to contain the spread of the disease.\nWhile the coronavirus is expected to continue exerting upward pressure on China’s consumer prices in the near term, inflation could ease in the coming quarters, he said.\nChen also said he expects China’s yuan currency to remain stable around 7.0 to the U.S. dollar in the near term, due in part to ample foreign exchange reserves.\nThe country’s debt market is stable, with no significant rise in defaults, he said during a briefing where he was joined by other senior Chinese financial regulators.\nZhou Liang, vice chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said China is ready to buffer financial risks caused by the virus outbreak, and is studying plans to reform the country’s asset management companies that are tasked to deal with bad loans.\nChina’s non-performing loan ratio rose to 2.08% at the end of February, Zhou said, adding that China’s banking sector has disposed of a total of 5.8 trillion yuan ($817.48 billion) in bad loans in the past three years.\n",

It also lowered its full-year GDP forecast to 3% growth from an earlier estimate of 5.5%.\nFor the fourth straight day, imported coronavirus cases in China outnumbered cases of local transmission.\nThe rising risk of imported cases has prompted some parts of the country to tighten monitoring of foreign travelers, and the Chinese foreign ministry on Tuesday advised its citizens to avoid travel to high-risk countries.\nMainland China had 21 new confirmed cases on Monday, the National Health Commission said, up from 16 a day earlier. Of the new cases, 20 involved infected travelers from abroad.\nRaising further concerns about spread of the disease, a man recently returned from Spain has tested positive for the virus - despite showing no symptoms - and has been put under observation and into quarantine, according to a statement on the website of the city of Mianyang, Sichuan.\nAn additional 25 passengers who had shared a flight with the man and two of his family members have also been subject to quarantine, the statement said.\nIn contrast to the growing number of imported cases, mainland China had only one case of locally transmitted infection on Monday, in Wuhan, capital of central Hubei province where the flu-like disease appeared in humans late last year.\nThe capital Beijing accounted for nine of the imported new cases even as it imposed tough restrictions to screen out and isolate infections coming from abroad.\nBeijing Capital International Airport has cordoned off a special zone for all international flights, with all disembarking passengers required to submit to health checks.\nTransit passengers were sent to their connecting flights, while non-transit passengers were shuttled to a nearby processing venue from which they were dispatched to designated places for compulsory 14-day quarantine.\nBeijing also closed its new Daxing airport to international flights and redirected them to the older Capital International Airport in the northeast of the city, in order to contain any new infections in one facility.\nOn Tuesday, Shanghai extended existing quarantine measures to travelers who have recently visited the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden, Belgium, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark and Austria.\nChina’s eastern Shandong province and southwestern Chongqing city will require all overseas arrivals to be quarantined in designated locations or residences for 14 days, the official Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday.\nIn the central city of Wuhan officials said they would begin requiring overseas arrivals to undergo 14-day quarantine at a central location at the people’s own cost, emulating Beijing.\nWuhan, a transport and industrial hub of 11 million people, is the epicenter of China’s outbreak and the origin of the pandemic that has now infected more than 100,000 people beyond China’s borders.\nOfficials in the city initially tried to cover up the outbreak when it began late last year, but Beijing has lately sought to emphasize the positive role China has played in controlling the global spread of the disease.\nAn editorial in the official China Daily said the rest of the world should learn from China and follow the principles of early detection, early quarantine and early treatment.\nTop Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday that attempts by U.S. politicians to denigrate China’s efforts to curb the coronavirus would not succeed, and could lead to retaliation.\nThe tally of confirmed U.S. cases has multiplied rapidly in recent days, exceeding 4,660. At least 87 people in the United States have died of the disease.\nAround the world, there have been more than 7,160 deaths linked to the coronavirus across 163 countries and territories, according to a Reuters tally based on official statements. China now accounts for less than half of those deaths.\nWith the numbers of new infections dwindling in China, Xinhua news agency reported that a first batch of medical workers who had traveled to Hubei province to assist with the crisis had departed on Tuesday morning.\nThe economic outlook was also brightening, with state planning officials saying China’s economy would return to normal in the second quarter as factories reopened, businesses resumed trading and consumers started spending again.\n“Over 90% of large-scale industrial companies in regions outside of Hubei have resumed production, and resumption rates for places including Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shanghai are close to 100%,” Meng Wei, spokeswoman of the state planner told a news briefing on Tuesday.\nThe number of railway loadings had returned to normal levels, and civil aviation, ports and water transportation were all operating normally, she said.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Reuters) - A study looking at 10 Chinese children who were infected with the novel coronavirus has uncovered evidence that COVID-19, the respiratory disease it causes, can appear as a less-serious infection, illustrating how difficult the infection can be to detect based only on symptoms.\nThe study led by Chinese researchers, published on Friday in the journal Nature Medicine, found that one of the children showed no symptoms at all and the rest had mild symptoms.\nThe researchers also found that the virus itself can continue to appear in fecal samples long after nose and throat swabs no longer show evidence of an infection. Rectal swab testing may be a more effective way to determine how long to quarantine children, the researchers said.\nThe only reason the 10 children - six boys and four girls ranging in age from two months to 15 years - were tested at a hospital in the city of Guangzhou was because they were family members of COVID-19 patients or had close contact with people diagnosed with the disease, not because medical care had been sought for them, the researchers said.\nFive of the children had a cough, four had a sore throat, three had diarrhea and two had nasal congestion and runny nose, symptoms that the researchers said could can make COVID-19 look like other illnesses.\n“Mild and atypical presentations of the infection in children may make it difficult to detect,” according to the study, whose lead author was Dr. Yi Xu of Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center in Guangzhou.\nIn all, 745 children deemed as “highly suspected” of being infected were screened between Jan. 22 and Feb. 20. Of that group, 1.3% were found to be infected.\nThe low ratio follows the pattern described by researchers in another study published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine in which a separate team of Chinese doctors reporting out of the city of Wuhan found that only 1.6% of respiratory infections among hospitalized children were COVID-19. The outbreak emerged last December in Wuhan and the virus has since spread to various parts of the world.\nIn this latest study, seven of the 10 children had a fever, although it was never higher than 39 degrees C (102.2 F).\nNone had the pneumonia that has made the disease deadly in some adults, although CT scans showed that five of the 10 children had isolated or multiple patchy “ground-glass” patches, usually in the outer lung fields.\nThe headache, muscle aches, nausea, lethargy, labored breathing, vomiting and disorientation that can be seen in adults who have COVID-19 were all absent in this small group of infected children, the researchers said.\nThe researchers cautioned that although the virus was persistently found in the rectal swabs of eight of the 10 children even after it had vanished from nose and throat swabs, it was not clear if the virus particles present in the feces were infectious.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "\nI must say so far, it has been a success. That is because we started acting right from the beginning when the first three cases were identified in Kerala. Our response was very good.\nIt was not like we started our efforts groping in the dark. We did everything systematically and in a structured manner trying to find the local clusters where the infected people might have accidentally gone.\nNo, I am talking about India. The Government of India brought the stranded people from Wuhan in China, and then quarantined them.\nWe had all the information about the number of Indians in China, how many of them were coming and how many were staying back.\nIt was not like fighting an unknown enemy. We knew what we were doing. I would say it was a very structured and systematic effort that took place.\nHere in Kerala, we had only a handful of infected people. But we were confident that nobody else in India would get the infection from anybody who came back from China.\nYou should see this as the most important positive point. Not a single person in India got infected from anybody during the China epidemic.\nIt changed only when the epidemic reached Europe.\nIn the China epidemic, the numbers were limited. And we exactly knew how many people were coming to India from China. And we had fixed points of entry.\nAnother most important thing was, most of those coming from China were youngsters who were otherwise healthy.\nAlso, those who were coming from China came as single individuals as most of them were students there. They did not come as family. So, it was easy to isolate them and contain the virus. We had no difficulty in keeping them away from their families for long periods too.\nThis was what happened during the Wuhan episode.\nThe situation is totally different with the epidemic in Europe and the Middle East.\nThere are two or three reasons for this. First, people are coming from so many areas. It is a convergence of so many routes and landing in so many places in India like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kerala, Bangalore, etc.\nAnd they are getting redistributed among the Indian population.\nYes. Right now, if you look at the number, you will see that 99.9% of the infected people got infected when they were outside India.\nThis time, different strata of family members are affected because unlike those who came from China, those coming from Europe and the US are coming to join the families here. So, the first preference the moment they land at the airport, is go to their families.\nAnd most of the time they are coming to meet the elderly people in their families back home. This is a big challenge for us. Our primary job right now is to prevent them from meeting elderly family members.\nLook at the Ranni incident that happened in Kerala. The family who came here from Italy had a family reunion immediately after they landed. Then, they visited other relatives and also attended some family functions.\nI would say our country is not responsible for what has happened so far. Any control measures you announce in India will have no impact when people come to India carrying the virus. Unless of course, you stop them from coming to India.\nI will tell you how the virus spreads.\nThose coming with the virus will first infect those who are in close contact. That is not a community spread; just cluster spread. Like the family who came to Ranni infected other family members, which is the close cluster of people.\nIf another person or a group of people get infected from someone in this cluster, and then infects somebody else, we will reach a situation where we will not be able to trace the origin.\nThat's when community spread starts. Community spread happens when the cluster spread gets dispersed.\nOur job right now is to prevent the clusters from dispersing.\nIt is possible, that is what Kerala is doing right now.\nFor example, people from Ranni landed here on the 29th of February. Six people got infected from them in the first week of March. Now, we are in the third week of March. So far, not a single person who was in contact with one of these family members, has developed the disease.\nExactly.\nFrom what the prime minister said, it appears that other states are following the same method as this is the only scientific method to prevent community spread.\nWhat we have done is nothing out of the world; just a scientific and systematic approach to the problem.\nNow, the 150-odd people who have come to the country with the virus, are staying in their own homes. If they infect their family members or the infected family members go out and infect somebody else, we may find it difficult to trace them.\nThat's why we are trying to track the route of the maximum number of people and keep them in the net so that we will come to know immediately when somebody develops the symptoms.\nThe only way to prevent the disease from spending is keeping the infected person away from the population. And that's what we are doing right now.\nNo. We do not have enough scientific information on whether environmental temperature has anything to do with this.\nWe see the Gulf countries also getting affected, and we can't say that the temperature is low in those countries. Their winter is over, and now the temperature is high.\nYou can't say that India is not getting affected; India is getting affected. And the time is only catching up with us, and we do not know whether the numbers will go up or not.\nThe difference is, other countries did not behave the way we have done so far.\nIn fact, even though we are telling people not to panic, we are sending panic messages, and this should keep the Indian population away from the infected people. In a way, this shouting out is good.\nToday, except in the metropolitan cities, you don't see anyone outside on the streets. If you go to any place in Kerala right now, you will see that people are not coming out at all.\nFor a disease to affect people, you need three components. One is, the person should have the virus. Second is the transmissible range of the virus. And the third is the number of susceptible people who are coming into contact with the person with the virus.\nThis is the formula; AxBxC. Here A is constant; the number of people who are infected is constant right now. It is increasing only at a slow pace.\nThe transmissible range is fixed as far as the virus is concerned. It is not going to change and it is not changing.\nSo, the determinant of the formula AxBxC is the number of susceptible people who are going to get into contact with the person with the virus. That is where we are right now.\nWhat has happened in many other countries is, for example in Europe or the US, the control of the government on the common man is much, much less than what we have here.\nHere, the common man listens. We have a tendency to listen to or respect authority. We don't question them. This may be one of the good traits that Indians have.\nThis is exactly what helped China though whether you want to listen to authority or not, you are forced to listen there. And the authority was very powerful too. Here the authority is not powerful, but people are ready to listen.\nThere is no doubt about it. We now know how to face the disease.\nIf it had happened here in India first instead of in China, it would have been the end of it!\nYes, we have been fortunate that way.\nBut looking at what is happening in the European countries, the US and the UK, I feel they have not learnt the lessons from the China epidemic.\nAlso, Europe has a porous border. So, it is easy for the virus to spread.\nIf you take India, there are hundreds of villages in India where people don't need to mix with outsiders. While mixing happens very easily in Europe. That could be one of the reasons why it spread so fast throughout Europe.\nThough there is no scientific proof to it, I think because Indians are exposed to so many viruses, we do not know whether immunity against one of those viruses is protecting us from the coronavirus. We do not know. It is a remote responsibility.\nIf the virus can kill somebody, it can survive only for a short time.\nIf the virus does not kill you, it can survive for a longer period.\nAbout SARS, anybody who is infected with SARS lives only for a very small span of time. That was what happened with Nipah, and Ebola where the mortality rate was very high.\nAnd when the mortality rate is so high, the number of people remaining with the virus comes down.\nSimilarly, nobody with HIV virus dies immediately; they live for 10 to 15 years.\nIt means, in such conditions, viruses survive in the human body for longer periods. When that happens, more and more people get infected from them.\nThe problem with coronavirus is that only the elderly is affected. So, if we have a system where the elderly alone is protected, we can prevent deaths and infections a lot.\nThat's why in the guidelines to be followed, the government has asked people above 65 to be quarantined even if they are not infected. This will prevent the vulnerable population from getting exposed to the virus.\nIf nobody dies of the coronavirus, nobody will be bothered about the virus. See, we have the common cold, flu, respiratory viruses and hundreds and thousands of people get infected. But nobody dies of these viruses.\nOur problem is the elderly and people with existing illnesses. So, our target should be to see that these people do not get infected.\nIn the case of HIV, we had a similar situation till ART became available. With HIV treatment available, things are totally different.\nIn the case of covid-19, a majority of people who are suffering from the infection are recovering without any problem.\nWe are not worried about the number of youngsters getting infected with coronavirus because they will have a spontaneous recovery. Their mortality is 1 in 1,000 which is much less than, say, road accidents. More young people die from road accidents than due to coronavirus infection.\nWe are only worried about the young people giving the infection to those around them, and they include the elderly and the diabetics. So, we want to prevent that from happening./p>\nBy now, we know what is going to happen tomorrow. The whole picture is clear to us. That is why India is likely to succeed in this war.\nYes. Unlike European countries, a majority of our population is young. Maybe that's why India has a bigger chance to succeed against covid-19. We cannot say anything with certainly unless we prove it scientifically.\nIndia may not succumb like other countries. At the same time, if we are a little careless, we will run into trouble. No doubt about that.\nYes. If you are not worried, you will not be careful. Like any country in the world has to be worried, India also has to be worried. If you are careless, there will be problems.\nYes, the next two weeks are crucial. Because if we go to the next stage, then it will be a stage of no return. That is what happened to Italy and the whole of Europe.\nWe don't want to go to that stage. Controlling 150 people who came to India is not difficult, but controlling even 50,000 people is very difficult and impossible.\nThat will happen with all epidemics. After some time, the number of susceptible population will come down, that is when a good number of them either die or recover.\nThere is nothing unusual in China not reporting any new cases. It is something we have expected. The earlier you reach that, the more comfortable you are.\nIt is difficult to say. Every epidemic has got a trajectory; it goes up to a significant level and then comes down.\nThe only corollary I can think of is H1N1. It is still there in the community, but the big panic about it is over now.\nWhen people get H1N1, they are not dying in large numbers. Because we know how to handle the situation.\nSo, I feel covid-19 might linger on for many more months at a smaller pace. Or, it can become catastrophic. It is practically unpredictable now.\nWe are worried whether we will go to that situation. It is a real worry for the entire world.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "我必须说，到目前为止，这是一个成功。这是因为我们从喀拉拉邦发现前三个病例开始就采取行动。我们的反应很好。\n我们并不是在黑暗中开始摸索的。我们做的每件事都是系统的、有条理的，试图找到感染者可能意外离开的地方。\n不，我说的是印度。印度政府将这些被困人员从中国武汉带来，然后对他们进行隔离。\n我们掌握了所有的信息，包括在中国的印度人的数量，他们中有多少人来了，还有多少人留下来了。\n这不像是在和一个未知的敌人作战。我们知道我们在做什么。我想说，这是一项非常有组织和系统的努力。\n在喀拉拉邦，我们只有少数感染者。但我们相信，在印度，没有人会从任何从中国回来的人身上感染病毒。\n你应该把这看作是最重要的积极点。在中国流行期间，印度没有一个人受到任何人的感染。\n只有当这种流行病蔓延到欧洲时，情况才有所改变。\n在中国的流行病中，数量是有限的。我们完全知道有多少人从中国来印度。我们有固定的入口。\n另一件最重要的事情是，大多数来自中国的年轻人在其他方面都很健康。\n而且，那些来自中国的人都是单身，因为他们大多数都是中国学生。他们不是一家人来的。所以，很容易分离出它们并控制病毒。我们也不难让他们长期远离家人。\n这就是武汉事件中发生的事情。\n这种情况与欧洲和中东的流行病完全不同。\n这有两三个原因。首先，人们来自很多地. 它是印度众多航线的交汇点，在德里、孟买、海得拉巴、钦奈、喀拉拉邦、班加罗尔等地都有降落。\n他们正在印度人口中重新分配。\n对。现在，如果你看看这个数字，你会发现99.9%的感染者在印度以外的地方受到感染。\n这一次，不同阶层的家庭成员受到了影响，因为与来自中国的家庭不同，来自欧洲和美国的家庭成员是来这里加入家庭的。所以，当他们在机场降落时，他们的第一选择是去他们的家人那里。\n而且大部分时间他们都是来接家里的老人。这对我们来说是一个巨大的挑战。我们现在的主要工作是防止他们会见年迈的家庭成员。\n看看发生在喀拉拉邦的兰尼事件。从意大利来到这里的一家人在着陆后立即团聚。然后，他们拜访了其他亲戚，也参加了一些家庭活动。\n我想说，我们的国家对目前所发生的一切不负责任。你在印度宣布的任何控制措施在人们携带病毒来到印度时都不会产生影响。当然，除非你阻止他们来印度。\n我会告诉你病毒是如何传播的。\n携带这种病毒的人首先会感染那些密切接触的人。这不是一个社区传播；只是集群传播。像兰尼一家的其他成员也感染了兰尼，这是一个亲密的人群。\n如果另一个人或一组人从这个群中的某个人感染，然后再感染其他人，我们将达到无法追踪来源的情况。\n那是社区传播开始的时候。当集群扩散扩散时，就会发生集群扩散。\n我们现在的工作是防止集群分散。\n有可能，那就是喀拉拉邦现在所做.\n例如，兰尼的人在2月29日登陆这里。三月份的第一周就有六个人被感染了。现在，我们在三月的第三个星期。到目前为止，没有一个人接触过这些家庭成员中的一人患上这种疾病。\n确切地。\n从总理所说的来看，似乎其他州也在遵循同样的方法，因为这是防止社区蔓延的唯一科学方法。\n我们所做的并不是什么天方夜谭，只是对这个问题的科学和系统的处理。\n现在，带着病毒来到这个国家的150多人，都住在自己家里。如果他们感染了他们的家庭成员或者被感染的家庭成员出去感染了其他人，我们可能会发现很难追踪到他们。\n这就是为什么我们试图追踪最多人数的人的路线，并将他们保持在网络中，以便我们能立即知道何时有人出现症状。\n防止疾病蔓延的唯一方法就是让感染者远离人群。这就是我们现在正在做的。\n不，我们没有足够的科学资料来证明环境温度是否与此有关。\n我们看到海湾国家也受到影响，我们不能说这些国家的气温很低。他们的冬天结束了，现在气温很高。\n你不能说印度没有受到影响；印度正在受到影响。时间只会赶上我们，我们不知道数字会不会上升。\n不同的是，其他国家并没有像我们现在这样做。\n事实上，即使我们告诉人们不要惊慌，我们也在传递恐慌信息，这应该能让印度民众远离感染者。在某种程度上，这种叫喊是好的。\n今天，除了大城市，你在街上看不到任何. 如果你现在去喀拉拉邦的任何一个地方，你会发现人们根本不会出来。\n一种疾病要影响人，你需要三个要素。一是，人应该有病毒。其次是病毒的传播范围。第三是与病毒携带者接触的易感人群的数量。\n这是公式；AxBxC。这里A是恒定的；现在被感染的人数是恒定的。它的增长速度很慢。\n就病毒而言，传播范围是固定的。它不会改变，也不会改变。\n因此，公式AxBxC的决定因素是与病毒携带者接触的易感人群的数量。这就是我们现在的处境。\n在许多其他国家发生的事情，例如在欧洲或美国，政府对普通人的控制比我们这里的要少得多。\n在这里，普通人倾听。我们倾向于倾听或尊重权威。我们不会质疑他们。这可能是印度人的优良品质之一。\n这正是帮助中国的原因。不管你是否想听权威的话，你都不得不听。权威也非常强大。这里的权威并不强大，但人们愿意倾听。\n毫无疑问。我们现在知道如何面对这种疾病。\n如果这件事先发生在印度而不是中国，那就完了！\n是的，我们很幸运。\n但纵观欧洲国家、美国和英国的情况，我觉得它们没有从中国疫情中吸取教训。\n此外，欧洲的边界也有漏洞。所以，病毒很容易传播。\n如果以印度为例，印度有数百个村庄，人们不需要与外来者混在一起。而混合在欧洲很容易发生。这可能是它在欧洲传播如此之快的原因之.\n虽然没有科学证据，但我认为，因为印度人接触了这么多病毒，我们不知道对其中一种病毒的免疫是否能保护我们免受冠状病毒的侵害。我们不知道。这是一个遥远的责任。\n如果病毒能杀死某人，它只能存活很短的时间。\n如果病毒没有杀死你，它可以存活更长的时间。\n关于非典，任何感染非典的人只能活很短的一段时间。尼帕病毒和埃博拉病毒的死亡率都很高。\n当死亡率如此之高时，病毒携带者的数量就会下降。\n同样，艾滋病毒携带者也不会立即死亡；他们能活10到15年。\n这意味着，在这种情况下，病毒在人体内存活的时间更长。当这种情况发生时，越来越多的人受到感染。\n冠状病毒的问题是只有老年人受到影响。因此，如果我们有一个保护老年人的系统，我们可以预防很多死亡和感染。\n这就是为什么在要遵循的指导方针中，政府要求65岁以上的人即使没有感染也要隔离。这将防止易受感染人群接触病毒。\n如果没有人死于冠状病毒，就没有人会为病毒而烦恼。看，我们有常见的感冒，流感，呼吸道病毒和成百上千的人被感染。但是没有人死于这些病毒。\n我们的问题是老年人和有疾病的人。所以，我们的目标应该是确保这些人不会被感染。\n在艾滋病病毒的病例中，我们也有类似的情况，直到抗逆转录病毒疗法出现。有了艾滋病治疗，情况就完全不同了。\n在covid-19的病例中，大多数感染者正在康复，没有任何问.\n我们并不担心会有多少年轻人感染冠状病毒，因为他们会自发康复。他们的死亡率是千分之一，远低于交通事故。死于交通事故的年轻人比死于冠状病毒感染的年轻人多。\n我们只担心年轻人把感染传染给周围的人，他们包括老年人和糖尿病患者。所以，我们希望防止这种情况发生\n现在，我们知道明天会发生什么。我们看得很清楚。这就是为什么印度有可能在这场战争中取得成功。\n对。与欧洲国家不同，我国大多数人口是年轻人。也许这就是为什么印度有更大的机会战胜科维德-19。除非我们科学地证明，否则我们不能肯定地说什么。\n印度可能不会像其他国家一样屈服。同时，如果我们稍有不慎，就会遇到麻烦。毫无疑问。\n对。如果你不担心，你就不会小心。就像世界上任何国家都必须担心一样，印度也必须担心。如果你粗心，就会有问题。\n是的，接下来的两周至关重要。因为如果我们进入下一个阶段，那么这将是一个没有回报的阶段。意大利和整个欧洲就是这样。\n我们不想去那个舞台。控制150名来到印度的人并不困难，但控制甚至5万人都非常困难，不可能。\n所有流行病都会发生这种情况。一段时间后，易感人群的数量就会下降，也就是说，相当一部分人要么死亡，要么康复。\n在中国，没有任何不寻常的事情不报告任何新的案件。这是我们所期待的。你越早到达那里，你就越舒服。\n很难说。每一种流行病都有一个发展轨迹；它会上升到一个显著的水平，然后下降。\n我能想到的唯一推论是H1N. 它仍然存在于社会中，但是关于它的大恐慌现在已经结束了。\n当人们感染H1N1病毒时，他们不会大量死亡。因为我们知道如何处理这种情况。\n所以，我觉得covid-19可能会以较小的速度在更长的时间内停留。或者，它可能成为灾难。现在几乎是不可预测的。\n我们担心是否会出现这种情况。这真是全世界的担忧",

        "news_content_translate_en": "As of March 28, less than three months after the world was made aware of the novel coronavirus, 600,000 people across 177 countries/regions have been infected with it. The infection which reportedly originated from a market in Wuhan city in the Chinese province of Hubei, has claimed more than 27,800 lives.\nWith nations entering lockdown in an effort to 'flatten the curve' of social interactions by means of social distancing, it is very important to refrain from placing one's beliefs in any miraculous cures or conspiracy theories about COVID-19. Here are some widely shared myths about the novel coronavirus that stand nowhere on the scale of scientific relevance.\nThis is a myth. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has observed that this infection can be transmitted in any and all areas regardless of climate.\nThis is not true. While wearing a mask in a crowded place is advisable, the mask cannot prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus. In some cases where the person wearing the mask touches an infected surface before touching his/her face to re-adjust the mask, this protective gear could lead to infection, said the Director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria.\nThis is a myth. The normal body temperature remains stable between 36.5°C to 37°C despite the temperature of one's bath, says the WHO.\nThere is no evidence whatsoever to prove this claim. While alcohol-based hand sanitizers are a recommended precaution against any virus, drinking alcohol while seeking to cure Covid-19 is the same as drinking alcohol-based hand sanitizer and expecting it to taste like a pint of beer.\nIt has been established that the novel coronavirus jumped species from an animal to a man and is originally a zoonotic disease. However, no known animal species has been known to carry this virus as of yet and medical experts have asked people not to believe in rumours and eat non-vegetarian meals as long as they are prepared with utmost care for hygiene.\nThis is a myth. Dr Faheem Younus, the Chief of Infectious Diseases at the University of Maryland says that a person infected with the novel coronavirus can also hold his/her breath for longer than 10 seconds. On the other hand, the elderly will not be able to accomplish this task but it does not in any way mean that they are infected.\nDirector of AIIMS, Dr Randeep Guleria says that one should not visit a hospital during a pandemic since it increases the chances of a healthy person catching the virus. One should consult a doctor over the phone if he/she is experiencing any symptoms at all and seek future course of action.\nThis is a myth. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the consumption of garlic boosts the immunity system or safeguards one from being infected with Covid-19.\nThis is untrue. One should not donate blood at a time like this unless and until one is absolutely sure that he/she is not infected.\nThis is a myth. No study or research has shown that mosquitoes can act as carriers of the novel coronavirus. \"The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose,\" says WHO.\nThese are myths. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), one should regularly wash one's hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Apart from this, neither a hand dryer nor an ultraviolet disinfection lamp can kill the virus.\nThis is a myth. Pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine cannot protect anyone from Covid-19 since the vaccine for the new coronavirus is yet to be discovered.\nThis is untrue. While some preliminary research has shown that the novel coronavirus remains on certain surfaces such as cardboard for some time, it cannot spread through parcels received from China.\nThis is not entirely true. A thermal scanner detects body temperature and is great for identifying someone with a high fever, however, medical experts and doctors treating Covid-19 patients have said that initial research shows how people who display no symptoms can also be infected with the virus.\nThis is untrue. The transmission of novel coronavirus has been seen in people of all ages. Doctors suggest that people with co-morbid conditions such as blood pressure, heart or respiratory diseases are at a higher risk if they get infected with Covid-19. However, a perfectly healthy person can also be infected in the presence of a Covid-19 patient.\n",

With over 242,000 infections and nearly 10,000 deaths, the epidemic has stunned the world and drawn comparisons with painful periods such as World War Two, the 2008 financial crisis and the 1918 Spanish flu.\nThe LPR is a lending reference rate set monthly by 18 banks. The PBOC revamped the mechanism to price LPR in August, loosely pegging it to the medium-term lending facility rate.\nThe PBOC left borrowing cost on its one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans unchanged on Monday, despite its U.S. counterpart’s decision to slash interest rates to near zero to counteract the economic shock from the coronavirus outbreak.\n",

Henk Bekedam, the WHO Representative to India, was quoted as saying that the \"commitment of the Indian government from the top level has been enormous, and very impressive\".\nAt the very first level -- unlike China, which long remained in denial mode -- the Indian government was quick enough to activate its health management system and issue necessary travel advisories. Many state governments followed suit, leading to the early detection and isolation of infected patients.\nMoreover, the state machinery -- led by the Ministry of Health and other related agencies -- were prompt enough to issue 'valid precautionary guidelines' to keep the public well-informed and prepared.\nThe monitoring of the coronavirus outbreak at the PMO level has backed this process. Well-coordinated action plans include careful airport checking, active health laboratories and the quick establishment of quarantine facilities across the country. The strategy of the government has been to stick to the prevention is better than cure’ model.\nMore importantly, the Indian government has also been applauded globally for safely flying back many of its citizens -- especially workers and students stuck abroad in the mainland China and other coronavirus-affected countries, speaking volumes about the government’s concern and efforts for its citizens.\nIn addition, Indian efforts have remained completely aligned to guidelines from the WHO, which has been monitoring the crisis since it began and advocating the aggressive testing, tracking and isolation of as many Covid-19 (the disease caused by the novel coronavirus) cases as possible.\nTo sum it up, managing a new virus outbreak is never a easy task for any state, but the way the Indian emergency response system has been activated holds lessons for the other countries in the future.\nAbhishek Pratap Singh has a PhD in China Studies from JNU and teaches at the Deshbandhu College, University of Delhi.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Over 6,000 people have died globally since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. More than 1,62,000 have been infected by Covid-19. What started in China, soon spread across France, the US, Spain, Italy, South Korea and now India.\nIndia, so far, has officially reported 110 cases and two deaths, according to the Ministry of Health. More cases are emerging every day even as states continue to issue advisories on social distancing.\nThe government has put in place stringent measures to curb the spread of the virus. A mandatory quarantine of 14 days has been initiated for all international travellers arriving in the country.\nFrom thermal screenings at major entry-exit points to sanitisation of public places, the Indian government has put its best foot forward in battling the pandemic which has led to significant panic among Indians.\nSelf-discipline is the best cure\nHowever, more than scrutinising the steps taken by the government, the utmost requirement at the moment is self-discipline.\nWith the threat of the rapidly spreading virus looming large over India due to its billion-plus population, it is important to understand the depravity that could be if the spread is not limited in the initial days.\nItaly is the best example to map how rapidly the virus can spread and why it is absolutely essential to impose self-restrictions at an early stage, and not wait for the disaster to strike.\nThe country recorded 368 more deaths from the coronavirus outbreak on Sunday, its biggest single-day rise, amid growing concern about the ability of its strained health system to cope with the relentless increase in new cases. With 24,747 cases and 1,809 deaths by Sunday - a rise of 368 or 25 per cent in the death toll in just 24 hours - Italy's experience has offered an alarming example for other European countries. And, Indians should take note.\nThe daily rise in cases around the globe, especially in countries like Italy -- with a small population of 60 million people -- is alarming. If the virus spreads with such aggressiveness in India, it could result in severe consequences even after the virus fades away.\nIn Italy, hospitals are also unable to cope with such high-frequency rise on a daily basis. Roberta Re, a nurse at Piacenza hospital in Emilia-Romagna called the situation 'war-like', as reported by The Guardian.\n\"It's an experience I would compare to a world war, but it's a war that isn't fightable with traditional arms - as we don't yet know who the enemy is and so it's difficult to fight. The only weapon we do have to avoid things getting even worse is to stay at home and to respect the rules, to do what they did in China, as this is paying off,\" she said.\nPrecaution, not panic\nWith an abundance of global examples that show the severe spread of Covid-19, it can be deduced that most infections spread through lack of individual restrictions at an initial stage. And as the situation aggravated with rising cases in a country or one particular area, the excessive panic was witnessed.\nThis panic, if substituted by precautions at early stages, could help India avoid the health crisis of a much larger magnitude. However, the government alone would not be able to help limit the virus; all citizens must also act responsibly and take the outbreak seriously.\nSocial media chatter over the past few months since the outbreak has often misled people, as some took it lightly and others panicked to insanity. However, doctors advised none of the above. Instead, they asked people to be prepared with some basic but necessary precautions. Social distancing, however, is the most important one.\nThree ways that you can help\n1) Doctors have asked people to stay home if they absolutely do not have to go out.\n2) Medical experts have also asked people to avoid any kind of large gatherings.\n3) Take care of hygiene, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your face\nThese are a few simple steps you can take to support the government in limiting the spread of Covid-19. While not much is known about this virus, doctors, have asked people to follow these important steps at the moment to delay the spread of the virus. But even if you test positive, there is no need to suppress your travel history or run away.\nThe quarantine process is not only for the recovery of an infected person but it is also for the safety of other people in the country. Going by the rate of spread in Italy, Iran, and China, any person with symptoms coming in contact with other people could prove deadly as the virus would keep multiplying. Even if it does not affect an individual carrying it, doctors have clearly mentioned that its spread could be fatal for older people with a weak immune system.\nFor instance, one of the first cases in Uttar Pradesh's Noida which led to an initial shut down of two schools and a five-star hotel, was from a man who returned from Italy and kept his travel history suppressed. He then kept on with his usual social life, exposing others to the danger.\nThere are many other reports in India about suspected people running away in fear that they would be kept in isolation in the quarantine facility. But people have to realise that the process will help in containing the spread of the virus to a great extent.\nIndia is still in the initial stages with 110 official confirmed cases, and so far, it has managed to keep the death toll much lower than the other countries in the third week of the outbreak. And, by imposing self-restrictions, individuals can help the government in flattening the curve further.\nPeople on social media, especially, the young batch who are yet to grasp the seriousness of the issue, need to be more self vigilant. The basics include - doctor visit for 'flu-like symptoms', avoiding crowded places and social gathering until absolutely necessary, restricting movement, opting for work-from-home.

Hong Kong said most of the recent confirmed cases in the past two weeks were imported.\nIn Taiwan, 24 new cases up to Tuesday were all imported, while South Korea had 44 new infections involving infected travelers as of Sunday.\nSingapore confirmed 17 new infections on Monday, its biggest daily jump in cases, with 11 of those imported.\nThe rush to flee virus hotspots in Europe and the United States has pushed up the price of flights. A ticket from London to Hong Kong was going for up to HK$50,000 on Monday night as people tried to get to the city before it imposed tougher restrictions.\nIt is safer home than in Britain as the policy to contain the outbreak under Boris Johnson is doubtful, said Ling, a Cambridge University student after landing in Hong Kong wearing a surgical mask and rubber gloves.\nThe number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Britain rose to 1,543, up from 1,372 the day before, the health ministry said on Monday. The British death toll rose to 55.\nFour of Hong Kong’s 157 confirmed coronavirus patients have died, while more than 3,200 people have died from the disease in mainland China, the highest number of fatalities.\nTOUGHER RESTRICTIONS\nMeasures in China, Hong Kong and Singapore, include city-wide lockdowns, border tightening, contact tracing efforts and strict social distancing.\nThe virus has already taken a heavy economic toll, especially in mainland China and global financial hub Hong Kong, so any rise in new cases could be devastating.\nHong Kong on Tuesday toughened measures on travelers, requiring 14 days of quarantine for those entering the city as of midnight on Thursday, and joined Singapore in advising against all non-essential travel.\nChina said all inbound, non-transit travelers to Beijing need to be isolated for 14 days at designated quarantine venues, mostly hotels in the city.\nMacau, the world’s biggest gambling hub, on Tuesday banned the entry of all non-residents, a move likely to have a significant impact on the already struggling casino industry.\nHow seriously authorities in Asia take the virus battle has been underscored by punishments meted out or threatened to those who violate quarantine rules or give false information about their whereabouts or travel history.\nTaiwan said those who do not follow home isolation or quarantine rules could be fined between T$100,000 and T$1 million (US$ 3,300- US$33,000), and has advised people not to travel abroad at all.\nWe held firm to block the first wave of infection, but a new wave is coming, so everyone should cooperate with disease prevention efforts, Taiwanese Health Minister Chen Shih-chung told a news conference on Monday.\nBOOMERANG EFFECT\nWhile the imported infections in mainland China are still modest in number - 143 cases so far - authorities are concerned that virus carriers could trigger a second wave.\nThe first imported case was reported in late February in the northwestern Ningxia region involving a traveler flying in from Iran.\nMore cases quickly arrived from Iran, a hotspot with nearly 15,000 infections so far, followed by the first infected travelers from Italy in the first week of March.\nSoon, the infected were spotted on flights from countries including Spain, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\nThe Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand entered the list this week.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The UK must act like a \"wartime\" government and do whatever it takes to support the country's economy, Prime Minster Boris Johnson has said as Britain's death toll from the COVID-19 rose to 71 and the number of cases stand at nearly 2,000.\nLondon is described as the hotspot of the pandemic as the virus rapidly spreads across different parts of the UK, which remains in semi-lockdown in line with the UK government's advice for everyone to avoid non-essential social contact and travel, both domestic and international.\nJohnson's remarks came as India closed its borders to those travelling from the UK. The Indian High Commission in London has set up a system of online registration for all Indian citizens in the UK worried about their visas and keen to travel back to India and said it was working to \"address all concerns\".\nIndia on Monday banned the entry of passengers from Europe, Turkey and the UK from March 18 till March 31 to contain the spread of the deadly virus.\n\"We announced the steps that we did - advising against all unnecessary contact - steps that are unprecedented since World War II. They will have an effect on the spread of the disease,\" said Johnson in his daily briefing related to the pandemic from 10 Downing Street on Tuesday.\nThe current death toll in the UK stands at 71 - with half of England's fatalities reported in London alone. The cases exploded by 407 to 1,950 on Monday, the biggest daily increase yet.\n\"We must act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy,\" he said, as UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a massive 330-billion pounds bailout package for businesses to survive through the crisis.\nThe Indian-origin finance minister said his set of measures, including a tax and mortgage holiday for an extended period as well as grants and easier access to loans, will help relieve the pressure on companies as he promised to do \"whatever it takes\" to protect livelihoods.\nOpposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged the government to suspend home rental fees and ban evictions of tenants during the coronavirus crisis.\nFar-reaching emergency powers that will allow the police to detain people who may be infected with the coronavirus and force them to be tested will pass through the House of Commons soon without the need for a formal vote.\nUK health secretary Matt Hancock said that the law would be used only \"when it is absolutely necessary\" to help to cope with the impact of the virus. The measures have been agreed between the parties and are likely to be passed through the Commons \"on the nod\". They are expected to gain royal assent before the UK Parliament goes into its Easter recess next week.\n\"Public support and compliance is crucial and we are grateful for the flexibility people have shown, but we need to ensure police and immigration officers have the authority to enforce these measures where necessary,\" said a UK government spokesperson.\nAs in any wartime scenario, supermarkets in the country are set to restrict what customers can buy to prevent stockpiling. They will also urge customers to use less cash to prevent passing on the virus and may scrap self-checkout tills.\n\"We have enough food coming into the system but are limiting sales so that it stays on shelves for longer and can be bought by a larger number of customers,\" said Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's.\nOthers have temporarily scrapped 24-hour opening at some stores, closing doors at midnight or 10pm to allow shelves to be replenished. Social media images showing shelves emptied of lavatory rolls are said to be partly to blame for triggering further panic buying.\nA new document published by a COVID-19 team at London's Imperial College, which is advising the Boris Johnson government on its coronavirus response, warns the current public health threat is the \"most serious\" from a respiratory virus since the Spanish Flu in 1918 when 50 million people had died in the UK.\nIt has advised Britain to adopt a strategy of \"epidemic suppression\" - for a period of potentially 18 months or more - rather than \"mitigation\" to help the state-funded National Health Service (NHS) cope.\nThe resulting government advice for the public is that those who live alone and have a high temperature or a new and continuous cough should self-isolate for seven days. Those in a household with others and have a high temperature or a new and continuous cough, everyone in the household should stay isolated together for 14 days.\nEveryone, whether displaying symptoms or not, should stop all unnecessary contact with others and all unnecessary travel and should work from home where possible and avoid venues such as pubs, clubs, theatres and restaurants.\nThe outbreak, which first emerged in China's Wuhan city last year, has marched across the globe, infecting 198,006 people and killing 7,948, according to a tracker maintained by the Johns Hopkins University.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "At present, more than 140 countries have reported outbreaks of the new epidemic, and the number of cases diagnosed at world level is nearly 200 thousand. The fight against this new disease does not imply that only healthcare professionals are placed at the forefront, but also that all the people and their leaders are aligned and face this battle side by side.\nBut at this point the question must be asked: what matters more to our rulers, the defence of the life and welfare of their people or rather the economic development of a country?\nFrom Chinese experience, it has become clear that the best way to control the epidemic is to reduce as much as possible the flow of people and goods. However, behind this difficult decision to paralyse the productive fabric of a country arises the fear of a new financial crisis. But if we imagine that the epidemic cannot be alleviated, how can we re-launch a country's economy in the event of disorder, coupled with the collapse of national health systems? At the moment, the decision-making of governments must put the heart of the defence of the lives of their people. Therefore, due to the severity of the pandemic in Europe, Portugal must seriously respect the state of emergency declaration.\nAfter the outbreak of the epidemic in Wuhan, Chinese hospitals were put on the first line of defense in order to prevent the spread of this war with invisible enemies. Fever measurements at the reception of hospitals, to quickly detect contamination, 24-hour available attendings and online consultations served to prevent cross-infection. Constant dissemination of the number and location of the infected and of the recommendations that the ordinary citizen can implement to prevent the spread of the disease has strengthened confidence in the fight against the epidemiYeah.\nAt the provincial level, local governments announce daily the number of confirmed infections, either online on official websites or on regional television channels. In addition, the central government has developed and updated a computer application that allows you to see on a map where infected people are. This allows those travelling to take precautions and avoid affected areas.\nAnother measure was the rationalization and distribution of surgical masks by communities. In large Chinese cities, the majority of the population lives in communities, a kind of private-security condo managed by a committee. These committees have been distributing protective masks, as required by apartment. Due to the optimization in the delivery of masks, the turnout to pharmacies has been reduced. In addition, the committees have organised to measure the temperature of each person leaving the community in order to avoid possible cases of contamination, and have issued access cards to their residents in order to prevent strangers from entering the condominiums. In communities where there are residents in permanent isolation from infection, it is also the committee that ensures the purchase of daily food and property from quarantine residents. Moreover, even in Wuhan, the epicenter of this catastrophe, every day the government has ensured food supplies, which prevented widespread panic in supermarkets.\nAt a time of serious crisis such as this, another crucial question arises: for the people, what is more important now? To affirm the supremacy of individual freedom or the security, welfare and future of the nation? Some news in recent days highlights the lack of awareness in the European population of the gravity of the new coronavirus, coupled with the lack of firm and objective measures on the part of policymakers, highlights a risk both to the future of democratic values and to collective well-beingYeah.\nIn Portugal, despite the lack of assertiveness of government bodies, we nevertheless had an excellent example from President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. After learning that he would probably have com e into contact with infected students, the President opted not to take risks and cancelled all of his public activities. In this way, he called with his example to the whole country in the form of self-isolation, demonstrating that the den-19 should not be seen lightly. Nevertheless, several caricature phenomena occurred in Portugal, such as the young people gathered on the beach after the decision to close some universities and the bars that created a thematic coronavirus party to attract customers.\nCoincidentally, this kind of bizarre behaviour has occurred a little throughout Europe: in the Italian Parliament who wears a mask is ridiculed, in the UK thousands of people are organising concerts in the middle of this crisis. Throughout Europe there have been unspeakable scenes of'persecution of individual freedom', but is this highly individualistic and selfish vision in the face of an infectious crisis not just stupid? Is the virus concerned with individual freedom? Viruses only care about their own freedom. When people walk down the street without protective measures, the spread of the virus spreads everywhere, even if it is not noticed.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThe dim-19 began to spread to Chin a just at the time of the Chinese New Year, a period in which tradition forces us to reunite our family. However, even in this period, the Chinese people never prioritized celebration of the importance of stopping the virus from moving as quickly as possible, implementing unprecedented national isolatioYeah. In a power with 1,4 billion people, the entire population stayed at home voluntarily and cancelled meetings, family visits and trips. The most famous sights in Shanghai, which every day attracted thousands of people, became empty, making us even question whether this almost post-apolitical scenario is really the city we once chose to live in. Whether in large cities or in remote villages, some of the methods of fighting the disease may be considered extravagant, but to prevent the virus it is enough to wash your hands often and stay home.\nIn the famous work The Three Musketeers, written by Alexandre Dumas, there is a saying that fits perfectly with Europe at this time:'One for all, all for one'. Faced with the common threat of the new coronavirus, human beings are one community of common destiny. Today the collective is more important than institutional dilemmas, nationalism and individualism. Everyone can contribute to the fight against the coronavirus. The great goal of eliminating this pandemic cannot be achieved without the joint efforts of the entire population",

A possible host could be the pangolim, which is consumed as food and used in traditional Chinese medicine.\nFor the job, Yi Guan and colleagues analyzed samples of 18 Malaysian pangolins seized in smuggling operations in southern China between August 2017 and January 2018, and all of them found different types of coronaviruYeah.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Although the new virus is sparing one of the groups considered vulnerable, that of children, and is a threat to middle-aged and older adults, it has also struck more men than women among its mortal victims.\nAccording to an assessment made at the end of the week by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China, men and women are infected with approximately equal numbers by the coronavirus. However, the male mortality rate is 2,8%, compared to 1,7% of women, reveals the New York Times.\nThe outbreak of viral pneumonia Covid-19, which has already affected at least 77 thousand people in China, causing 2400 fatalities,'is a crisis'and'huge proof' for the Chinese authorities, said the President of that country, in state television statements this Sunday.\nAccording to the same US newspaper, men have also been more affected during outbreaks of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2002/2003; and MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome) in the last five years.\nFor example, according to a study published in Annals of Internal Medicine magazine in Hong Kong in 2003, more women than men were infected by SARS, but the mortality rate among men was fifty% higher. As for MERS, death reached 32% of infected men and 25.8% of women. The New York Times goes up to 1918, pneumonic flu, known as Spanish flu, to confirm that then more men than women died.\nWhat makes men less resistant? \"We've seen this happen to other viruseYeah. Women fight them better than men,\"she begins by answering Sabra Klein, Public Health School researcher Johns Hopkins Bloomberg, who studies sexual differences in viral infections and vaccine reactions, adding that women also produce stronger immune responses after vaccination. Men have more difficulty fighting infections.\nThe answer lies in the female immune system, which is more resistant, confirms Janine Clayton, from the National Health Institute and female health researcher, to the New York Times. But if it resists respiratory viruses better, the same cannot be said of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, in which women are more likely to get sick than men, he adds.\nFor the time being, there are no definitive answers as to why it is the immune system of women stronger than men, but one hypothesis has to do with female sex hormones, estrogens, which seem to contribute to strengthening the immune system, as well as the fact that they have two X chromosomes, while men have only one.\nExperiments with mice on the SARS coronavirus showed that males were more susceptible to infection, a difference that increased with age. They developed the disease with lower viral exposures than they did, just as they had greater lung damage. When the microbiology researchers at the University of Iowa, led by Stanley Perlman, blocked the estrogens in the infected females or removed the ovaries, they had a better chance of dying than the female mice that had not been intervened. So estrogens are supposed to play a protective role.\nBut there are other health and behavioural factors that may justify female resistance to virusesYeah. For example, in China, the fact that men smoke more than women, they represent only 2% of a 316 million smokers, one third of the world's smokers, can help them not to resist the virus attacking the airway s o well.\nStill in that country, they have higher rates of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. They, a little around the world, have healthier living habits than they do, which can also contribute to their resistance.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nDownload the PUBLIC app, subscribe to our notifications and be aware of the evolution of the new coronavirus",

This mainly concentrates on restricting professional travel, using teleconferencing and social networks for daily activity and asking workers to stay home whenever they have been out of the country during the last two weeks.\nIt is multinationals with headquarters or presence in Portugal that, because of their size, already have more concrete measures in the field, according to the responses received in writing by the PUBLIC of 14 companies and two sectoral organisations.\nIn Switzerland, Nestle, the largest food group in the world with two factories in the country, has been asked \"to all employees who do not undertake international travel on the job in the next three weeks, specifically in the period between February 25th and March 15th\".\nIn the largest Portuguese distribution company, Geronimo Martins, which recalls that in the three markets in which it operates (Portugal, Poland and Colombia) \"there is no confirmed coronavirus case so far\", the restrictions are currently geographically located, in particular in the area where the first cases arose. \"Immediately from the start of the coronavirus crisis, professional travel to Asia has been prohibited in the Geronimo Martins group and personal travel has also been advised.\"\nEDP, whose largest shareholder is China Three Gorges, \"advises employees to avoid travel to China, and countries/areas where there are active Covid-19 transmission communitiesYeah.\nIn the case of Galp Oil, \"all planned journeys to the areas currently affected are suspended\", and their execution is \"restricted to cases of strict necessity,\" recognising the company led by Carlos Gomes da Silva who \"will continue to monitor the evolution of the situation and assess any adjustments to the measures taken\".\nBy the same token, the multinational Vodafone advances that \"all [professional trips] that are not urgent will be delayed\". The telecom operator \"also recommends that in the case of personal travel by its employees, travel to risk destinations should be avoided\". It ensures that it \"is monitoring the development of the situation\" and that if there is worsening, \"additional protective measures will be taken, which may include the total suspension of all professional travel\".\nEqually drastic is the choice of the Sumol+Compal beverage manufacturer: \"S+C has prohibited professional travel to all countries deemed to be at risk and restricted to what is strictly necessary all other professional travel,\" said official source. \"The prohibition affects all its employees\" and \"the situation is reviewed and reviewed every week\".\n\"In order to mitigate the risk of contagion, travel abroad and air transport travel are conditioned\", the Millennium BCP, in turn, responds, which states that \"it is monitoring closely the situation in all geographies where it operates and scrupulously observing all the recommendations issued in the case of Portugal, the DGS guidelines\".\nThe Super Bock Group, which in recent years has included China in the list of its core exporting markets, not only advises on \"trips to destinations with restrictions imposed by official entities, as well as\"physical\"meetings and close contact with people from the areas identified in Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and JapaYeah.\nIn the Altice telecommunications operator, it was decided to postpone non-essential air travel, in particular to the Asian continent, with \"air travel to countries with identified cases\" all subject to risk/benefit analysis.\n\"At the beginning of February 2020\", underlines the official source of the telecom group with presence in various markets, \"a communication was made to Altice Portugal management teams with preventive information and guidance to be spread throughout the organization.\" And, \"Since then, a contingency plan has been drawn up that is constantly being updated.\"\nAlso earlier this month, the Super Bock Group set up \"an internal committee with medical monitoring to monitor this situation\". \"Included in the support of Medicine at Work of the Group\", clarifies the official source of the brewery, \"a specific medical contact has been designated for which employees should channel any questions or information through email or telephone.\"\nCGD also \"has a contingency plan where actions to be taken in the event of a pandemic are planned\", but the public bank does not go into detail, stressing however that \"the General Warehouse Box accompanies the positions taken by the Directorate-General for Health\".\nThe CTT \"are reinforcing the Contingency Plan for possible crisis situations in order to ensure the continuity and service level of their activity\" and has already \"several communications to all employees with the recommendations of the Directorate General for Health (DGS). It is \"implementing these same recommendations in the company\".\nFidelity Insurance Group, held in 85% by the Chinese conglomerate Fosun and 15% by CGD, ensures that \"it has drafted a contingency plan for responding to the viral outbreak Covid-19 and that it complements the Business Continuity Plan that the company has permanently prepared to respond to any adverse scenario, where a scenario of a viral outbreak is also included.Yeah.\nREN, which stresses that \"its priority is the safety of all employees and the safeguarding of the management of critical operations of their responsibility, as the management of national electricity and natural gas transmission systems, states that it is \"monitoring developments from the outset in coordination with official entities\", following the DGS recommendations. \"All employees are aware of the importance of preventive measures having access to internal and external channels to clear doubts and obtain additional information.\"\nIn the operator Nos, daily follow-up has been made, \"in full alignment with the DGS and the WHO\" of the evolution of the 2019-nCoV virus. \"There are, of course,\" adds official source, \"a series of preventative measures already taken care of,\" but this does not go into detail.\nIn the case of FIPA, the Federation of Portuguese Food Industries, explains Pedro Queiroz, Director-General of the organisation: \"we have no planned trip to the most affected countries\". \"At the moment, the Federation is doing all of its work within normality and without cancelling any national or international commitments.\"\nIn addition to preventive measures to prevent employees from travelling to destinations more or less exposed to the new coronavirus, most companies have chosen to ask officials, having travelled, mainly because of the \"bridge\" that Carnival Day, the 25th February, allowed, to opt for the simplest. Staying home and resorting to telework.\nIn the case of Vodafone, \"employees must proactively inform their direct management of personal travel abroad that they have recently undertaken or planned, identifying any schedules\" in countries where they have passeYeah. The \"extension of the work regime on mobility, which is already common practice in Vodafone\" may \"in an emergency situation\" become \"more employees for longer\" to be covered.\n\"Aware that we are returning from a holiday period as a measure of control and prevention, Galp's people who may return from affected areas will be at home working under home office conditions, following applicable good practice, and access to medical examinations will be made available,\" Explains official oil source.\nAt Sumol+Compal, \"Employees who travel to risky destinations on holiday have to inform Human Resources and comply with the Contingency Plan plan plan\" situation being \"reviewed and reviewed every week\".\nIn the former Unicer, \"any collaborator, family member or person close to him who has travelled in recent days\" to China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Iran \"take specific measures to contact our designated doctor, so that proper monitoring of the clinical condition can be carried out and screening of any possible incubation.\" If they have travelled to other destinations, \"including through airports, the additional recommendation is that workers\"make sure that all elements of the group close to them are in good health and without any symptoms that may be associated with this disease\".\nSimilar solution is being applied in the JM group. \"Since Italy is now considered a focus country,\" employees returning from this or any country considered to be a focus should stay at home until the period deemed necessary to ensure that the person is not infected.\" \"We will take the additional measures necessary, as the situation develops\", added official source of the owner of the Sweet PinYeah.\n\"Situations in which the integration of persons returning from a trip to China or from countries listed by the ECDC should be covered by remote working arrangements for a period of two weeks and return to the premises of the ECDC EDP should only occur if symptoms of coughing, fever or respiratory distress do not appear during that period.\"\nAltice will also \"monitor and support employees returning from infected areas\" and \"resort to teleworking\".\nIn BCP, always possible and \"as is already practice in the bank\", it ensures official source, \"video conference meetings are preferred\" in a context of air travel restriction.\n\"Alternative communication methods, such a s Skype or the telepresence communication system\", which exist in all markets where you are present, are what Nestle chooses instead of \"professional domestic travel\" and recommends \"to all employees\". \"On the other hand\", adds official source of Nest l e Portugal, the fact that it is today a company \"that has implemented more agile and flexible working practices\" allows its employees \"to work from anywhere, including from their homes if they feel it is necessary\".\nHowever, the Swiss food company has no impact on activity with the outbreak of the new coronavirus locally. \"In the case of Nestle Portugal, there is currently no constraint on our supply chain or on our exports.\"\nThe beverage manufacturer Sumol+Compal ensures that \"it is not possible at this time to assess or correlate any variation of activity with the coronavirus outbreak\".\nOverall, the Super Bock Group does not advance for the moment. \"We are, above all, monitoring the situation for the overall dimension it is having.Yeah. In the specific case of the Chinese market, says official source, \"it is premature to assess impacts on the operation, considering that exports to China in the months of January and February are as a rule, milder because it is a time of year with lower temperatures and also because there were relevant orders in November and December to safeguard the festivities such as the Chinese New Year\", this year celebrated the 25th of January.\nFIPA, the federation to which the three groups belong, believes that the majority of the companies (in the agri-food and beverage sector) are operating in a normal way. Pedro Queiroz acknowledges that \"it is still premature to make any such assessment\", and recalls that \"although it is a market of great attractiveness, China represents still little more than 1% of the agri-food customers and suppliers\". Conclusion? \"A significant impact on the sector cannot be found.\"\nFrom the distribution comes a similar response: \"the Portuguese Association of Distribution Companies (APED) has so far not registered any changes to the normal functioning of the commercial spaces of its members\". \"Both consumption and supply are taking place with complete normality\", guarantees the association that brings together hybrids and supermarkets and brands with Ikea and Fnac.\nJM specifically says that there is no'any impact':'with regard to China, we have no exposure to food imports and with regard to non-food products imports are also very low'.\nEDP, which is present in several geographies, says that \"so far no impact has been recorded on the normal functioning of the various companies in the group\".\nVila Gale assures in tourism:'We have not yet detected any impact of the coronavirus on the reserves'of the second largest Portuguese hotel chaiYeah.\nCTT, in turn, ensures that \"export and import flows to China are open and uninterrupted\", but accepts that \"they have seen a reduction in transport supply and a change in normality in Chinese economic activity due to the slowdown in the local economy\".\nVodafone replies that \"at this stage there is no impact of the coronavirus on the activity\" of the telecommunications operator in Portugal and questioned about China as a client and/or supplier, assures that \"it is monitoring closely the development of the situation, together with manufacturers and suppliers, in order to minimise the impacts that may come to exist in your business.\"\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nIn the same way, and \"seeking to anticipate and mitigate the possible impacts of the virus, Altice Portugal is in permanent contact with its partners, having already implemented preventive measures such as strengthening equipment stock coverages.\" As a telecommunications operator, you are not experiencing any immediate impact on your activity.\nFinally, Nos has \"been managing\" with its \"equipment partners the possible impacts that the evolution of this situation may have on the normal functioning of the activity\" the group.

The exact origin of the virus remains to be seen, which host (animal) and whether or not there was an intermediate host. The form of transmission between humans, the exact period in which this transmission takes place and the rate of attack of the virus is also unclear. In other words, to know the epidemiology of the new infection, the \"who\", the \"how\" and the \"when\".\nHere are some questions about the virus for which there is no answer:\nAlthough the number of infected is increasing daily, it is still not really known what the reach of the virus is.\nIt is not known whether the virus also affects all types of people, adults or children, sick or healthy, as pointed out to the agency Lusa the pneumologist Filipe Froes, appointed representative of the Medical Association for issues related to the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\nThe international authorities also do not know who has the most serious forms of the disease and what the characteristics of those killed by this new virus are.\nPneuologist recalls that no serious situation has yet occurred outside China, although all cases of the disease are imported from that Asian country.\nThere is a case report of a nine-month-old child infected by one of the parents, but it is not yet known whether the virus has affected children in the same way as it affects adults.\nPneuologist Filipe Froes recalls that the Chinese authorities warned that there may be transmission between people even before the onset of symptoms. It is not known whether it is an exception or a rule and how long before symptoms show up can the disease be contagious. It is also unknown whether, as in the case of SARS (English acronym for Acute Grave Respiratory Syndrome), there are patients with a higher contagious capacity than otherYeah.\nIt is also unknown what the longest period of transmission and even when it occurs.\nPatients are currently being treated with supportive measures that only treat the symptoms of the disease, such as fever or respiratory distress. There is still no specific medicine for this new coronavirus.\nFilipe Froes indicates that there will be experimental treatments under way, but it is still unknown how effective they will be. According to the expert, a vaccine will already be in development, much on the basis of the work that had been done for atypical pneumonia of 2002/2003-SARS. It is also necessary to wait for tests on effectiveness and safety.\nThe first cases of the new human coronavirus were linked to a fish and meat market in the Chinese town of Wuhan. However, it is not known which animal transmitted the virus to the first infected patient, nor whether an animal is the original host and another intermediate host.\nCoronavirus is a large family of viruses living in other animals (e.g. birds, bats, small mammals) and which in humans usually cause respiratory diseases, from a common cold to more serious cases such a s pneumonias. They can be transmitted between animals and people. Most coronavirus strains circulate between animals and do not even infect humans. In fact, so far, only six strains of coronavirus among the thousands existing have crossed the species barrier and reached people.\nThe new coronavirus is from the same family as the Grave Acute Respiratory Syndrome (2002-2003) virus and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (2012).\nThese two types of coronavirus are so far those who have been able to cross the species barrier and to transmit themselves to humans and who have pictures of some gravity, explained to the agency Lusa the pneumologist Filipe FroeYeah.\nThe first cases of 2019-nCoV appeared in mid-December in the Chinese town of Wuhan, when people with viral pneumonia began to arrive at hospitals.

        "news_content_translate_en": "There are at least ten positive cases of new coronavirus among more than 3700 passengers and crew members of the Diamond Princess cruise, which is in the port of Yokohama, about an hour away from Tokyo, said Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato, during a press conference this Tuesday.\nPassengers with positive tests are fifty to 80 years old. None showed severe symptoms and some did not even have any symptoms. \"We removed them from the boat and are sending them to medical centres,\" said the Japanese government official quoted by the BBC.\nOnly the results of 31 tests are known. 273 people have been tested so far, which means hundreds of people are still to be tested, so the number of infected can increase.\nThe ten confirmed patients will be quarantined for at least two weeks, according to Japanese law.\n\"We asked the people on board to behave in the best possible way, in order to avoid infections during the quarantine process,\" the minister said.\nSince Monday no one has been allowed to leave the ship, which is serving as a quarantine site in Yokohama harbor, about an hour from Tokyo. About half of the passengers were of Japanese origin and the nationality of the others was not disclosed. There are at least two macaroons aboard, according to Macao authorities.\nThe alert for the possibility of infection was given after an 80-year-old passenger who travelled on the vessel in January had a positive result in a coronavirus test.\nIn Hong Kong there is also another cruise, the World Dream, serving as a quarantine site, after thirty crew members have shown symptoms of the new coronavirus, including high fever, writes to ReuterYeah. At the moment, the 1800 passengers and crew members are being tested, about 90% were native to Hong Kong and there were no Chinese on board. However, there were three Chinese passengers who previously travelled on the vessel between 19 and 24th in January, who were infected with the virus, clarifies The Guardian.\nIn Hong Kong, all travellers arriving from China will be subject to mandatory quarantine from Saturday, Carrie Lam announced this Wednesday, and this rule applies to Hong Kong residents who have travelled and wish to return. The semi-autonomous region forces all travellers to at least four days of quarantine, writes the Associated Press agency.\nThe number of dead and infected with the new coronavirus in China continues to increase. 490 people died only in China, 64 of them in the last 24 hours, this Wednesday announced the Chinese health authorities. Around the world, since the end of December, 492 people have died: one person in Hong Kong and another person in the Philippines, both with ties to the Chinese province of Hubei, epicenter of the outbreak.\nThere are at least 24.492 people infected with the new coronavirus in China and 24.505 confirmed cases around the world.\nRecovery is, however, possible. On average, a patient needs nine days to fully recover. In Hubei, as there are more cases and fewer means to treat them, recovery time is higher: 20 days. According to data from Johns Hopkins University in the US, which has been updating the numbers for this virus, 911 people recovered in China after being diagnosed with the new coronavirus. W\nThe virus has killed more in China than the SARS epidemic (severe acute respiratory syndrome), between 2002 and 2003. However, the mortality rate is lower: in the case of the new coronavirus it is 2,1%, according to the Chinese National Health Commission. In Hubei province, epicentre of the outbreak, the rate is slightly higher: 3,1It was in this province that about 97% of all deaths occurred. The mortality rate during the SARS epidemic was 10%.\nAbout 80% of the fatalities of this virus were over 60 years old and 75% had other diseases than coronavirus. Two thirds of the victims were male, according to the latest report from the Chinese National Health Commission.\nThere are at least two medicines which, according to the in vitro tests, may be a solution for the treatment of the new coronavirus: remdesivir and coloroquina. The findings are from a group of researchers at the Wuhan Virology Institute, published in Cell Research magazine (also available in Nature).\nThe first drug, remdesivir, was developed by Gilead Sciences Pharmaceuticals and has not yet seen its use approved anywhere in the world. China can therefore pioneer its approval if clinical trials are successful.\nChloroquine, on the other hand, has been used for more than 70 years. It was especially relevant in the 1980s for the treatment of malaria, and it can be \"highly efficient\", according to laboratory tests, defends scientists. \"Chloroquine is a cheap and safe medicine that has been used for more than 70 years and therefore has the potential to be applied clinically against 2019-nCoV\", the study says.\nBoth medicinal products, tested in vitro, were shown to be \"highly effective\" in controlling the new coronavirus. \"As these components have been used in human patients, with records of their safety, and have shown to be effective against various diseases, we suggest that they be tested on humans infected with the new coronavirus\", reads at the end of the articlYeah.\nDuring the annual State of the Nation address at Congress, which happened last Tuesday night, US President Donald Trump stated that the US is working together with China to control the outbreak of the new coronavirus: \"We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working together on the coronavirus outbreak in China,\" he said without giving much more details. \"My government will take all necessary steps to protect our citizens from this threat,\" Trump added.\nAlso this Tuesday two US airlines (United and American Airlines) announced that they would suspend all travel to China and Hong Kong in accordance with the presidential order imposing restrictions on travel to and from China.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for \"a strong feeling of international solidarity\" and \"a strong feeling of support for China in these difficult circumstances\" to try to contain the coronavirus outbreak, and the xenophobia demonstrations that have begun to occur.\nAt a press conference in New York, Guterres expressed \"strong concern\" about the stigmatisation of people who are innocent and victims of this situation\"and called for efforts to avoid it, cites the South China Morning Post.\nSeveral countries are closing borders or banning the arrival of travelers who have been to China. Several nations, such as Portugal, have withdrawn nationals from affected areas in China, placing them in quarantine on arrival. This Wednesday, a plane with several New Zealanders, Australians and citizens from other Pacific nations arrived in Auckland from Wuhan. Returning citizens will then be sent to Christmas Island, where they will be quarantined",

In a statement on Saturday, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau said she had \"received the all clear from my physician and Ottawa Public Health.\"  \n Canada's domestic travel restrictions will take effect on Monday at noon EDT.  \n Asked how screening would be different, Trudeau said the government was giving new tools to airlines and railways. Transport Canada later said airline and rail company staff would ask health questions of passengers and look for visible symptoms.  \n Even enhanced screening offers \"no guarantee\" that sick people will not board, as they can hide symptoms, Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, said in a separate press conference.  \n Canada has confirmed 5,153 cases of coronavirus, and 55 deaths, health officials said. While case numbers are climbing, the rate of growth in British Columbia, the Pacific Coast province where community transmission was first reported, seems to be slowing, Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said.  \n \"There are signs of hope,\" she told reporters in Ottawa.  \n In the province of Quebec, however, the number of cases jumped by 24% in the past day to nearly 2,500, more than double any other province. Four additional deaths raised Quebec's death toll to 22.  \n New police checkpoints were set to begin restricting non-essential traffic to eight Quebec regions on Saturday, Quebec Deputy Premier Genevieve Guilbault.  \n Ontario banned public events and gatherings of more than five people on Saturday.  \n Air Canada, the country's biggest airline, said it would operate a special flight returning Canadians from Algeria on Tuesday, with additional flights scheduled from Peru and Ecuador.  \n China's embassy in Ottawa tweeted that the Bank of China had on Friday donated medical supplies to Canada, including thousands of masks, goggles and gloves.  \n Trudeau has faced criticism at home for sending a shipment of protective equipment to China in February, before COVID-19 cases spiked in Canada.

The massive rescue package, which would be the largest ever passed by Congress, goes to the House of Representatives for a vote on Friday.  \n  \n Time-out in U.S.-China blame game ahead of G20 summit  \n China and the United States have agreed to set aside their differences ahead of the G20 summit to discuss the coronavirus, the South China Morning Post reported, citing a diplomatic source familiar with preparatory talks.  \n U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's accusations that China is delaying the sharing of information, and his reference to the coronavirus as a \"Chinese virus\" - a term President Donald Trump has used - have angered Beijing.  \n But the message may not have reached the U.S. ambassador to Britain. In an interview with the London Times, he doubled down on criticism of China, accusing it of trying to cover up the epidemic and putting millions at risk.  \n  \n The spread  \n There are more than 470,000 cases in 200 countries and territories, Reuters figures tallied at 0200 GMT on Thursday showed. Ninety of these places have 100 cases or more.  \n Deaths linked to the virus rose by 2,400 to more than 21,000 worldwide. Italy recorded the most in the latest daily figures, with over 680 deaths. The death rate in Spain is also very high.  \n The United States has taken over from Italy as the country reporting the most new cases. It now accounts for roughly a third of all new cases reported in the past day, with almost 15,000 infections, and over 260 new deaths.  \n The disease has killed more than 900 people in the United States.  \n  \n Leave now, Australia tells cruise ships  \n Australia ordered two cruise ships to leave its waters on Thursday, after a liner that docked in Sydney Harbour last week became the primary source of infection.  \n Cruise ships have become a flashpoint after 147 of 2,700 passengers who were allowed to disembark from Carnival Corp's Ruby Princess later tested positive for COVID-19.  \n  \n Prince Charles did not \"jump the queue\" for testing  \n A junior British health minister defended Prince Charles and Britain's coronavirus testing procedures on Thursday, saying the heir to the throne did not \"jump the queue\" when he was tested and found positive for the disease.  \n When asked why Charles had a test while millions of frontline health workers have not, Edward Argar told Sky News: \"My understanding is that his symptoms, his condition, met that criteria... The Prince of Wales didn't jump the queue,\" he said.  \n  \n Coronavirus leaves Paris street in 1940s time warp  \n A Parisian neighbourhood has been left stuck in a World War Two time-warp after the makers of a 1940s-era film had to abandon their set before France went into a lockdown.  \n War propaganda and Socialist posters are plastered on walls along the cobbled Rue Androuet, in the Montmartre district, now lined by a mock jeweller's store, tailor and off-licence in war-time decor.

        "news_content_translate_en": "MADRID — More than three billion people around the world were living under lockdown on Wednesday (March 26) as governments stepped up their efforts against the coronavirus pandemic which has left more than 20,000 people dead. \n As the number of confirmed cases worldwide soared past 450,000, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that only a concerted global effort could stop the spread of the virus. \n In Spain, the number of fatalities surpassed those of China, where the novel coronavirus first emerged three months ago, making it the hardest-hit nation after Italy. \n A total of more than 20,800 deaths have now been reported in 182 countries and territories, according to an AFP tally. \n Stock markets rebounded after the US Congress moved closer to passing a US$2.2 trillion relief package to prop up a teetering US economy. \n In Washington, US President Donald Trump said New York, the epicenter of the US outbreak with over 30,000 cases, likely has a few \"tough weeks\" ahead but he would decide soon whether unaffected parts of the country can get back to work. \n \"We want to get our country going again,\" Mr Trump said. \"I'm not going to do anything rash or hastily. \n \"By Easter we'll have a recommendation and maybe before Easter,\" said Mr Trump, who had been touting a strong US economy as he faces an election in November. \n UN chief Guterres said the world needs to ban together to stem the pandemic. \n \"Covid-19 is threatening the whole of humanity — and the whole of humanity must fight back,\" Mr Guterres said, launching an appeal for US$2 billion to help the world's poor. \n \"Global action and solidarity are crucial,\" he said. \"Individual country responses are not going to be enough.\" \n TWO DEATHS IN RUSSIA \n India's stay-at-home order for its 1.3 billion people is now the biggest, taking the total number of individuals facing restrictions on their daily lives to more than three billion. \n Anxious Indians raced for supplies after the world's second-biggest population was ordered not to leave their houses for three weeks. \n Russia, which announced the death of two patients who tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday, is expected to follow suit. \n Russian President Vladimir Putin declared next week a public holiday and postponed a public vote on controversial constitutional reforms, urging people to follow instructions given by authorities. \n In Britain, heir to the throne Prince Charles became the latest high-profile figure to be infected, though he has suffered only mild symptoms. \n The G20 major economies will hold an emergency videoconference on Thursday to discuss a global response to the crisis, as will the 27 leaders of the European Union, the outbreak's new epicenter. \n China has begun to relax its own draconian restrictions on free movement in the province of Hubei — where the outbreak began in December — after the country reported no new cases. \n Crowds jammed trains and buses in the province as people took their first opportunity to travel. \n But Spain saw the number of deaths surge to more than 3,400 after 738 people died in the past 24 hours and the government announced a 432 million euro (S$682 million) deal to buy medical supplies from Beijing. \n The death toll in Italy jumped in 24 hours by 683 to 7,503 — by far the highest of any country. \n The number of French deaths was up by 231 on Wednesday to more than 1,330, and metro and rail services in Paris were cut to a minimum. \n Spain and Italy were joined by France and six more EU countries in urging Germany and the Netherlands to allow the issue of joint European bonds to cut borrowing costs and stabilise the eurozone economy. \n The call is likely to fall on deaf ears when EU leaders talk on Thursday — with northern members wary of pooling debt with big spenders — but they will sign off on an \"unprecedented\" recovery plan. \n 'PEOPLE DYING ALONE' \n At La Paz University Hospital in Madrid, nurse Guillen del Barrio sounded bereft as he related what happened overnight. \n \"It is really hard, we had feverish people for many hours in the waiting room,\" the 30-year-old told AFP. \n \"Many of my colleagues were crying because there were people who are dying alone, without seeing their family for the last time.\" \n Coronavirus cases are also spreading in the Middle East, where Iran's death toll topped 2,000, and in Africa, where Mali declared its first case and several nations announced states of emergency. \n In Japan, which has postponed this year's Olympic Games, Tokyo's governor urged residents to stay home this weekend, warning of a possible \"explosion\" of the coronavirus. \n Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre, believed by Christians to house Christ's tomb, was shut as Israel tightened movement restrictions. \n The impact of the pandemic is also hitting European football, with leagues and tournaments cancelled, while the fate of the Wimbledon tennis tournament could be decided next week. \n The economic damage of the virus — and the lockdowns — could also be devastating, with fears of a worldwide recession worse than the financial meltdown more than a decade ago. \n But financial markets rose after US leaders reached agreement on a stimulus package worth roughly 10 percent of the US economy, an injection Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said represented a \"wartime level of investment.\" \n Meanwhile, more than half of all Americans have been told to stay at home, including residents of the largest state, California. \n The United States has at least 65,700 cases and 942 people have died.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Mosques across Singapore will be closed for at least five days from Friday (March 13) for thorough disinfection, and this week’s Friday prayers are cancelled, Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli said. \n The moves come after two Singaporeans who attended a religious gathering in Malaysia were diagnosed with Covid-19 this week, he told a media briefing on Thursday. \n In addition, all mosque activities, such as classes, lectures and mosque-based kindergartens will be cancelled for 14 days from Friday to March 27. \n Mr Masagos, who is also Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, had written about the religious gathering in a Facebook post earlier on Thursday, saying that 95 Singaporeans had reportedly attended the event across the Causeway. \n About 10,000 people from several countries reportedly attended this religious gathering, which took place at Sri Petaling mosque, on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, between Feb 27 and March 1, the Malaysian authorities said. \n Elaborating at the briefing, Mr Masagos said that it is unclear whether the reported number of 95 Singaporean attendees is accurate. However, the authorities here are certain that at least 82 Singaporeans had been at the gathering. \n The Ministry of Health has received information on all 82 and is conducting contact tracing, he added. \n Of the two who have since been diagnosed with Covid-19, Mr Masagos said that one had gone to the doctor for medical attention on March 9. \n “We don't know exactly on what day he came back, but in between arriving in Singapore and getting medical attention, he performed his duties as an officer of a mosque and in that process, visited four mosques,” he said. \n After his March 9 visit to the doctor, the patient was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases on March 11 and a day later, tested positive for Covid-19, he added. \n “We shut down these four mosques today and sanitisation started today, but all mosques will be shut down for five days, which means tomorrow, there will be no Friday prayers,” Mr Masagos said. \n “As we know, many people who go to mosques are seniors, retired, so we think it's important for the moment to prevent congregations at mosques.” \n The four mosques visited by the patient and that were closed on Thursday are Al-Muttaqin Mosque in Ang Mo Kio, Kassim Mosque in Kembangan, Hajjah Fatimah Mosque in Kampong Glam and Jamae (Chulia) Mosque in Chinatown. \n It is not known which of the four mosques he was employed at, and whether he visited the other three mosques as part of his work duties or for personal reasons. \n As for the second Singaporean who has tested positive for Covid-19 after attending the event in Malaysia, Mr Masagos said that the authorities are still tracing his movements over the past few days and it is not known whether he visited any mosques since his return. \n Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, who is the Mufti — Singapore's highest Islamic authority — said that this is the first time in Singapore’s history that mosques islandwide are being closed at the same time and that Friday prayers are cancelled. \n Those looking for precedent will have to refer to the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, he said, who would cancel Friday prayers and instruct his community to pray at home in times of crises such as floods. \n “It is very important for us to continue to protect society and protect the vulnerable,” he added. \n “And if you look in recent days, at the fatwas, guidance and religious edicts issued by religious fatwa bodies around the world, you would find similar positions everywhere.” \n A fatwa is a religious edict issued by an Islamic authority. \n During the five-day closure, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) will monitor whether more confirmed Covid-19 cases arise among the attendees of the Malaysia event, Muis' chief executive officer Esa Masood said. \n “If our assessment is that beyond the two, there is a sizeable cluster, that would be a good reason to consider a possible extension (of the closure),” he said. \n “The other possible consideration is what happens in the region. We know the event had participants from various countries, so we’ll also be monitoring what happens among participants who returned to their home countries.” \n He noted, too, that the 82 Singapore participants of the Malaysian event are known to regularly visit various mosques around Singapore, which is a common practice among Muslims. \n “In view of this, our strategy at Muis is, in order to prevent a sizeable cluster from forming, we have taken the following steps.” \n When asked why Singapore is taking such unprecedented steps while neighbouring countries have not, Mr Masagos said: “Why should we follow people who may not be doing the right thing? We should do what we need to for Singapore and Singaporeans. We are not just protecting Muslims, we are protecting the nation.” \n He added: “This is the first time we are going through a situation where the spread of a virus is so global. Even Sars (the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003) was very much confined to China, Hong Kong and Singapore and H1N1 was not so contagious. (Covid-19) is growing in a way that medical experts are still trying to understand better.  \"What we know today is that we need to break the cycle of transmission so that it does not contribute towards spread within the community.” \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "One of the countries most affected by the Covid-19 epidemic is South Korea. It now has the second largest number of infected after China and the fourth largest number of fatalities, after China, Italy and Iran. Central element in the Korean situation is a church hitherto little known outside the country, Shincheonji, or, Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Testimony Tabernacle. It is one of many sects that exist in the majority non-religious country, but where Christianity remains the most practiced religion, followed by Buddhism.\nShincheonji's role in the epidemic became known when a 61-year-old woman had a car accident and was admitted. Days later, it turned out she was infected. As his story was being investigated, it became clear that he was a member of the church and that he had attended mass and eaten at a buffet. The amount of people you infected, as it turns out, was substantial. There is talk about forty people, who in turn will have infected many more.\nAs the woman was the 31st person to be identified with the virus, she was nicknamed \"patient 31\" and quickly began to be vilified. Many of his actions, including the fact that he has not revealed symptoms that were already noticeable to him, correspond to what is normal in his church. Shincheonji forces its members to attend services even when they are sick. Prayers are said with members very close to each other, and are forbidden to wear a mask in the temple, because it is considered that it offends God.\nAbove all, the church encourages followers to hide their membership status, in part to facilitate the practices of sub-reactionary proselytism that have made it seen as one of the most aggressive sects in the country, and even outside, inclusiveness in ChinaYeah. Although this country bans missionaries, Shincheonji seems to have been quite successful.\nThe epidemic now triggered from a Shincheonji temple in Daegu, a city in the south of the country. Chinese members from the Chinese city of Wuhan -the original focus of Covid-19- may be at the origin of the outbreak. In any case, the epidemic soon spread, reaching sometimes unexpected targets. One of the surprises was finding out that the director of the city's infectious disease prevention service was a member of the cult and was infected, just like a cop and a school teacher.\nWhen patient 31's case was reported and criticism began, the church instructed the faithful to disobey government orders and hide that they were members. In a message he wrote in an internal church application, Lee Man-hee said, \"This disease case is seen as the work of the demon to stop Shincheonji's rapid growth. Just like the evidence Job went through, it's to destroy our advance.\"\nShincheonji is now charged with preventing authorities from monitoring and isolating infected people. It was only after authorities searched church facilities, taking computers with the list of members, that the church finally released the names, ensuring it was doing everything it could to help the authorities.\nShincheojin was founded in 1984 by Lee Man-hee, a man currently 88-years old who claims to be the reincarnation of Christ and promises to take 144 thousand faithful to heaven with him. At the moment, the church has more than 245 thousand members, and a few tens of thousands more in other countries. In China, it is considered the most aggressive Christian sect, even by the habit of infiltrating other religious groups and recruiting among them.\nFormer church members have described a typical recruitment processYeah. They are approached by nice and youthful people who propose to live with them, often without referring to their belonging to that church, or even denying that they belong to one. When the potential recruit is already captivated, they suggest that he take part in some activity, for example a study of the Bible, and the process goes on. If the recruitment takes place, the new member will have the same obligations as the others, including actively recruiting.\nMany members are people who were in situations of relative emotional helplessness and are sought to be surrounded at all times by friends of the church, to provide support and above all to ensure that they are monitored at all times. Monitorors are known as \"eyes\", and new members as \"fresh fruit\" or \"new fruits\".\nWith ten thousand missionaries active the largest number after the United States South Korea is fertile ground for sects. Over the decades, there have been no shortage of scandals involving them. One of the notorious cases of recent years led to the resignation of President Park Geun-hye in 2016, in a case of corruption in which one of the protagonists was a friend, daughter of the founder of a shamanic sect, the Church of Eternal Life, who negotiated sales of political decisions through bribes. Another case happened in 2014 when the sinking of a ferry killed 304 people, mostly children. It was not long before it was known that the leader of such a Baptist Evangelical Church had converted the ship in a way that had left it unsafe.\nOnly last July, the leader of an apocalyptic cult was arrested for kidnapping, beating and enslaving hundreds of his followers. And there have also been sexual scandals with leaders who sexually abuse members for a long time.\nA Busan professor studying sects, Tark Ji-il, explained to the South China Morning Post that the appeal has a lot to do with the succession of tragedies that struck the country during the 20th centuryYeah. First the Japanese occupation, then the civil war, and finally the military dictatorship: \"The church spoke of the kingdom of heaven, but cults promised the kingdom on earth and the impending end of the world, so that everything could change\".

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — There are now 17 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infections from the latest cluster involving a private function at Safra Jurong, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (March 6). \n Of these, nine cases were among the 13 new Covid-19 infections that were reported on Friday — the highest number of cases reported in a day so far. \n HOW MANY PEOPLE ATTENDED THE EVENT? \n Speaking to reporters, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services at MOH, said that the authorities do not yet know the exact number of guests who were present at the dinner function on Feb 15. \n In a statement on Thursday, Safra said that the event was held at the Joy Garden Restaurant on its premises, which was then closed for cleaning from Feb 16 to 19. All visitors had their temperatures checked and were required to make declarations about their recent travel history, it added. \n “They did not have fever or exhibited any flu-like symptoms. They also did not have any recent travel history to mainland China within the past 14 days of their visit to the club as stated within their declaration,” Safra said. \n Assoc Prof Mak added that investigations are ongoing to assess how many people attended the dinner and which people might have had close contact with individuals who the authorities now know to have infections. \n WHAT KIND OF EVENT WAS IT?  \n Associate Professor Vernon Lee, director of communicable diseases at MOH, said that the private event was a sit-down dinner and a social event organised by a couple of individuals for friends and their other family members. \n Assoc Prof Mak said that people were seated at more than one table, and they were moving around the private function room throughout the dinner. \n WHY DID IT TAKE A WHILE TO FIND LINKS? \n Not all of the 17 confirmed cases from the cluster at Safra Jurong attended the private dinner function, Assoc Prof Mak said. Some of the infected people linked to the cluster were not present, but were family members of those who had attended the function. \n It took “some time” to establish how the infected people in the cluster were linked, he said. \n This came only after extensive recording, investigations of the movements of the infected people and contact tracing. Then the authorities were able to identify the activity that the confirmed cases had in common — that is, the private function at Safra Jurong. \n Assoc Prof Mak added that the authorities had to interview these individuals, trying to find out what their movements were, assessing who they had come into contact with and then interviewing those other people as well. \n “That takes time. And this explains why it is taking so long to establish the various people involved, to also make a diagnosis on these individuals as well,” he said, adding that contact tracing and investigations are continuing. \n Assoc Prof Mak warned that there is a possibility that more cases linked to this cluster will emerge over the next few days. \n WHY ARE SOME CASES ONLY EMERGING NOW? \n A number of cases from the Safra Jurong cluster presented themselves to the authorities “days after they were symptomatic”, Assoc Prof Mak said. \n Some of the infected people continued with social activities and went to work despite having respiratory symptoms, he added. \n “We’ve always been telling members of the public that if you are sick, please don’t mix around, (don’t) continue with your social activities (or) work activities. If you are sick, see a doctor early and isolate.”  \n When people do not heed the call to not go out to gatherings when they have flu-symptoms or are sick, it makes it harder to contain the disease and \"exposes other people who otherwise would have been well to the Covid-19 infection\", he said. \n \"And this thus makes our task even more challenging in trying to identify who the close contacts might be, and then isolating them and putting them on surveillance.” \n Assoc Prof Lee emphasised the same point: “It is all a cluster, as a result of someone symptomatic who went for the event. \n “So, as long as people adhere to these social responsibilities and don’t go around when they are ill, then we can see that this entire incident would not have happened.” \n Asked what had been done to the identified attendees at the private function, Assoc Prof Lee explained that it had been more than 14 days since the event took place, so only those who reported that they were unwell had to go to the hospital for checks. \n “Those who were well throughout would not have been quarantined because they had already passed that 14-day exposure period,” he said. \n WHO ELSE ARE LINKED TO THE CLUSTER? \n Aside from the nine newly confirmed cases on Friday, eight other cases reported previously have been linked to the cluster at Safra Jurong. \n They are: Case 96, a Year 1 Raffles Institution student, who is linked to Case 94, a 64-year-old Singaporean woman who is then linked to Case 112, an assistant cook at Creative O Preschoolers’ Bay. None of the cases has recently travelled to China, or Daegu city or Cheongdo county in South Korea. \n Case 107, a 68-year-old Singaporean woman, was in Jakarta, Indonesia from Feb 11 to 14, while Case 117, a 52-year-old Singaporean woman, was in Malaysia on March 1. \n Other cases linked to the Safra Jurong cluster are Cases 114, 115 and 116 who were confirmed on Thursday. \n WHAT PRECAUTIONS DID SAFRA JURONG TAKE?  \n In a statement on its website on Thursday, Safra said that the individuals who had attended the private dinner function and who then tested positive for Covid-19 had cleared mandatory temperature checks it had conducted. \n It said that all visitors and employees at Safra Jurong had undergone temperature checks which had been introduced in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, along with other measures such as increased cleaning and disinfection of facilities. \n All visitors have to make declarations about their travel history and to provide contact details, the statement added. \n In a Facebook post early on Friday, Safra said that the restaurant, along with all other possible areas which might have been visited by the affected individuals, was to be “thoroughly cleaned and disinfected again starting (March 6)”. \n In a separate Facebook post, Safra Jurong said that the restaurant will be closed from March 6 to 12. \n ",

So while we attend to the immediate needs we should also focus on the eventual recovery and make full use of this lull period,” he said.  \n The transport sector’s line-up of construction projects include getting a three-runway system at Changi Airport operational by the mid-2020s and having Tuas Port handle about 20 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of containers annually when phase one of operations becomes operational by 2027. \n “Together, these investments will grow our external connectivity and seize growth in the global transport of goods and people,” he said. \n Another international link to look into during this time is the proposed Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link project, which remains suspended until the end of this April, Mr Khaw added. \n Calling the RTS Link “the answer” to move the needle meaningfully when it comes to addressing frequent Causeway jams, he said: “While we remain committed to working with Malaysia to find a way forward, the project cannot be suspended indefinitely.  \n “We look forward to hearing from Malaysia.” \n Meanwhile, Mr Khaw said that companies and workers should be positioned to ride on the inevitable upturn even as people telecommute more and go out less while fewer tourists arrive during this time. \n He noted that bus, rail, taxi and private hire car ridership had fallen by about 20 per cent, airlines have cancelled over 20 per cent of their scheduled flights, passenger volume at Changi Airport has plunged by 25 per cent, and the cruise and ferry sectors are “devastated”. \n But firms should use the opportunity to “transform and grow”, pointing out that industry transformation roadmaps for the air, land and sea transport sectors are available. \n This includes accelerating the transformation of the rail workforce through the S$100 million rail manpower development package, he added. \n Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Member of Parliament for Mountbatten, also asked if there is a chance that works to build the Thomson-East Coast Line can be completed before 2023. \n To this, Mr Khaw said it is very difficult to expedite the MRT line’s building works any further as it is a complex project with many engineering and safety considerations.  \n “Safety first… Don’t be too hasty. Deadlines are there. Certainly, we want it (to be up) as soon as possible, but never compromise on safety,” he added. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SEOUL - South Korea reported hundreds of new coronavirus cases on Wednesday as many sick people waited for hospital beds in Daegu, the city at the centre of the worst outbreak outside China.  \n The new cases bring South Korea's total to 5,621, with at least 32 deaths, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.  \n Most cases were in and around Daegu, the country's fourth-largest city, where the flu-like virus has spread rapidly through members of a fringe Christian group.  \n Health officials expect the number of new cases to be high for the near future as they complete the testing of more than 200,000 members of the sect, as well as thousands of other suspected cases from smaller clusters.  \n \"We need special measures in times of emergency,\" South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a cabinet meeting, referring to extra medical resources for hotspots and economic measures including a $9.8 billion (£7.7 billion) stimulus.  \n \"In order to overcome COVID-19 as quickly as possible and minimise the impact on the economy, it is necessary to proactively inject all available resources.\"  \n COVID-19 is the illness caused by the new coronavirus which emerged from China late last year to spread around the world.  \n Hospitals in South Korea's hardest hit areas were scrambling to accommodate the surge in new patients.  \n In Daegu, 2,300 people were waiting to be admitted to hospitals and temporary medical facilities, Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said. A 100-bed military hospital that had been handling many of the most serious cases was due to have 200 additional beds available by Thursday, he added.  \n South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Tuesday declared \"war\" on the virus, apologised for shortages of face masks and promised support for virus-hit small businesses in Asia's fourth-biggest economy.  \n  \n TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS  \n Moon's office on Wednesday said he had cancelled a planned trip to the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Turkey in mid-March due to the crisis.  \n At least 92 countries have imposed some form of entry restrictions on arrivals from South Korea, according to a tally by Yonhap news agency.  \n Vice Foreign Minister Cho Sei-young met the U.S. ambassador on Wednesday as part of Seoul's efforts to prevent the United States from imposing restrictions.  \n In the meeting, Cho outlined South Korea's efforts to control the outbreak and urged the United States not to take steps that would affect exchanges between the two countries, the foreign ministry said.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump said this week his administration was watching Italy, South Korea and Japan - all with severe outbreaks - and would make a decision about travel restrictions \"at the right time\".  \n \"We remain confident in the South Korean government’s robust and comprehensive response efforts to limit the spread of the virus,\" U.S. ambassador Harry Harris tweeted after meeting Cho.  \n Up to 10,000 people are being tested each day in South Korea, and daily totals have decreased slightly since a peak of 909 new cases on Saturday, the KCDC said.  \n Experts caution that the results of those tests could take some time to be processed, leading to future spikes in confirmed cases.

Latvia, Saudi Arabia, Senegal and Morocco reported cases for the first time, bringing the total to more than 60 countries with the illness known as Covid-19. \n But equity markets surged after their worst plunge since the 2008 financial crisis last week, encouraged by the prospect of government action to stem the economic impact. In the United States, the Dow jumped nearly 1,300 points, or 5 per cent, while the S&P 500 closed 4.6% higher. \n Finance ministers of the G7 group of leading industrialised democracies were expected to discuss measures in a conference call on Tuesday (March 3), sources told Reuters. \n Oil prices jumped 4 per cent amid hopes of a deeper output cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). \n MORE THAN PREDICTED \n A senior US official said he was concerned about a likely jump in the number of cases in the United States, which has had more than 90, with six deaths. More testing will almost surely lead to more confirmed cases. \n \"When you have a number of cases that you've identified and they've been in the community for a while, you're going to wind up seeing a lot more cases than you would have predicted,\" Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the infectious diseases unit at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, told CNN. \n South Korea has had 26 deaths and reported another 599 infections on Monday, taking its tally to 4,335. \n Of the new cases in South Korea, 377 were from the city of Daegu. That is home to a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, to which most of South Korea's cases have been traced after some members visited the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the disease emerged. \n The Seoul government asked prosecutors to launch a murder investigation into leaders of the church. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said that if founder Lee Man-hee and other heads of the church had cooperated, fatalities could have been prevented. \n Mr Lee knelt and apologised to the country, saying that one church member had infected many others and calling the epidemic a \"great calamity\". \n It was not immediately known how many of South Korea's dead were members of the church. \n 'OUTBREAKS ARE CURBED' \n But Wuhan itself, at the centre of the epidemic, shut the first of 16 specially built hospitals that were hurriedly put up to treat coronavirus cases, the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said. \n There was also a steep fall in new cases in Hubei, the province around Wuhan, but China remained on alert for people returning home with the virus from other countries. \n The virus broke out in Wuhan late last year and has since infected more than 86,500 people, mostly in China. \n Only eight cases were reported in China beyond Hubei on Sunday, the WHO said. \n China's UN Ambassador Zhang Jun at a news conference said: “We definitely believe that with the coming of spring we’re not far from the coming of the victory of the final defeat of Covid-19.” \n Outside China, there are now more than 8,700 infected and over 125 deaths. \n Iran, one of the worst-hit nations, reported infections rising to 1,501, with 66 deaths, including a senior official. With stocks of gloves and other medical supplies running low in pharmacies, authorities uncovered a hoard of supplies including millions of gloves. \n In Britain, which has 40 confirmed cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to be prepared for a further spread.

        "news_content_translate_en": "GENEVA/DUBAI - All countries need to prepare to combat the coronavirus, the World Health Organization said on Thursday, as authorities raced to contain the epidemic's rapid global spread and Wall Street looked set for its biggest weekly fall since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.  \n With new infections reported around the world now surpassing those in mainland China, World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said even rich nations should prepare.  \n \"No country should assume it won't get cases, that would be a fatal mistake, quite literally,\" Tedros said, pointing to Italy, where 17 people have died in Europe's worst outbreak.  \n In addition to stockpiling medical supplies, governments ordered schools shut and cancelled big gatherings, including sports events, to try to halt spread of the flu-like disease known as COVID-19 that emerged in central China more than two months ago from an illegal wildlife market.  \n The death rate appears to be around 2 percent, although it could be lower if there are many mild, undiagnosed cases, experts say.  \n By comparison, seasonal influenza has a case fatality rate of around 0.1%, said Anthony Fauci, Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, ahead of a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence, who has been put in charge of coordinating the U.S. response.  \n \"So therefore you have somewhat of a serious potential for morbidity and mortality,\" he said, adding, \"We're dealing with a serious virus.\"  \n There is particular concern over a case in Japan in which a woman tested positive for the virus for a second time. Second positive tests have also been reported in China and could imply contracting the disease does not confer immunity. Scientists warned that much remains unknown about this new virus.  \n The head of the WHO's emergency program, Dr. Mike Ryan, said discussions were being held with organizers about the fate of the 2020 Olympics, scheduled for July in Tokyo, although no decision was expected soon.  \n Their cancellation or relocation would be a massive blow for Japan, which said it was closing its entire school system for the next month in a bid to prevent spread of the virus.  \n The virus has so far mainly battered China, causing nearly 80,000 infections and more than 2,700 deaths, according to WHO figures. It has spread to another 46 countries, where around 3,700 cases and 57 deaths have been reported.  \n \"This virus has pandemic potential,\" Tedros told reporters in Geneva. He said Iran, Italy and South Korea were at a \"decisive point,\" but still short of sustained community transmission.  \n  \n MARKET SELLOFF  \n Spooked by the impact on China, the heart of corporate supply chains, and the increasing effect on other countries, stocks sank deeper into the red on Thursday and oil prices fell.  \n Global equity markets have dropped for six straight days, wiping out more than $3.6 trillion in value <.MIWD00000PUS>.  \n The S&P 500 <.SPX> finished 12% below its Feb. 19 record close, marking its fastest correction ever in just six trading days, while the Dow registered a record one-day points drop, which was also its fourth 1,000-point decline in history and the second this week.  \n Jeremy Farrar, a specialist in infectious disease epidemics and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity, urged finance institutions to commit an initial $10 billion funds to fighting the virus.  \n \"What we are really missing is tangible, high-level funding and support from global financial institutions,\" he said in a statement. \"The possible impact of this coronavirus is far beyond a health emergency - it's a global crisis with potential to reach the scale of the global financial crisis of 2008.\"  \n Traders are betting the U.S. Federal Reserve will move aggressively to cut borrowing costs in coming months in response to the effects of the coronavirus on the economy.  \n Politicians are also scrambling to respond.  \n President Donald Trump's administration was considering invoking special powers to rapidly expand U.S. production of protective gear, two officials told Reuters.  \n California's governor complained that the state was monitoring over 8,000 people but had only 200 test kits.  \n President Emmanuel Macron attempted to rally the nation as France's number of reported cases doubled.  \n \"We have a crisis before us. An epidemic is on its way,\" Macron said.  \n Germany, too, has warned of an impending epidemic. And Greece, a gateway for refugees from the Middle East and beyond, announced tighter border controls.  \n There is no cure for the coronavirus, which can lead to pneumonia, and a vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop.  \n  \n MISINFORMATION 'EPIDEMIC'  \n Iran extended closures of cinemas, cultural events and conferences for another week and called off Friday prayers in some cities.  \n The WHO's Ryan said Iran's outbreak may be worse than realized. It has suffered the highest death toll outside China, with 26 dead, suggesting there are likely many more cases than the 245 reported, which includes some senior officials.  \n Italy, desperate to stave off a probable recession, warned that an \"epidemic of misleading information\" could do worse harm than the virus itself.  \n The coronavirus has played havoc with global aviation and tourism as airlines cancel flights, countries ban visitors from hot spots and nervous passengers put off travel.  \n Chinese authorities said the number of new deaths there stood at 29, its lowest daily tally since Jan. 28. There were 439 new cases in mainland China as of Thursday, the WHO said, compared to 746 elsewhere.  \n  \n [Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus: open https://tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 in an external browser.] REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Some health experts are saying that patients cured of the Covid-19 disease are unlikely to get reinfected, although they cannot say for sure exactly what is causing some discharged patients in the Chinese city of Wuhan to test positive again for the coronavirus.  \n Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist from the Mount Elizabeth Novena Specialist Centre, offered a theory: Wuhan patients who have been discharged are likely those who have recovered from their illness but were not tested negative for the virus.  \n Over the weekend, reports have emerged that some discharged patients in Wuhan have tested positive again, prompting the authorities there to introduce a 14-day mandatory quarantine for Covid-19 patients who have recovered.  \n From last Saturday (Feb 22), all patients in Wuhan who had recovered and were discharged have to be sent to designated places for two weeks of quarantine and medical observation, the city's coronavirus treatment and control command centre said on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. \n The Covid-19 outbreak began in Wuhan from China’s Hubei province, and has now spread to 36 other countries and territories, including Singapore, which confirmed 91 cases as of noon on Tuesday (Feb 25).  \n Other countries such as South Korea, Japan and Iran are also seeing jumps in the number of new cases daily.  \n The virus, which can cause severe pneumonia and acute respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath and cough,  has infected more than 80,000 individuals globally and killed more than 2,700, most of them Chinese nationals.  \n DOES A RECOVERED PATIENT DEVELOP IMMUNITY? \n The health experts interviewed by TODAY said that reinfection among discharged Covid-19 patients is unlikely, although they said it is too early to determine the reasons why it happened.   \n Taking reference from how the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2002 and 2003 behaved, Dr Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said: “We found high levels of immunity in recovered Sars patients and this is likely to be the case with Covid-19.” \n Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, who heads the infectious diseases programme at the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, agrees that patients infected with other coronaviruses do develop an immunity after an infection.  \n “(The immunity) lasts for at least a few years, although this immunity does not appear to be lifelong,” he said.  \n However, Assoc Prof Hsu said that it is not yet known whether Covid-19 would behave in the same manner because not enough time has lapsed for more research to be done on the virus yet. \n Offering his view on the matter is Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the World Health Organization’s research policy and cooperation department in Geneva. \n He said that a discharged patient who tests positive again could be either a reactivation or reinfection.  \n “Both are possible and hard to differentiate. Some viruses remain dormant but can reappear,” Prof Pangestu said.  \n Emeritus Professor Duane Gubler at the Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School said that not enough is known about this virus to know what kind of immune response infected individuals develop.  \n “We need serological tests to help determine what kind, how much and the duration of protective antibodies.” \n WHAT COULD BE CAUSING THE POSITIVE TESTS? \n Health experts told TODAY that there could be several reasons why discharged patients get tested positive again. These include inaccurate tests being done or patients not being tested to confirm that they are free of the virus before being discharged. \n Emeritus Prof Gubler said that false positive results are not uncommon with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that is now being used for Covid-19.  \n A second set of primers — single strands of DNA or RNA, which stands for ribonucleic acid — that are based on a different part of the genome should be used for quality control, he added. \n RNA carries genetic information, enabling the tests to pinpoint organisms such as viruses. \n The PCR test could also have detected viral RNA that is not infectious but that can persist for various periods of time, Emeritus Prof Gubler said. \n “It is possible for detectable RNA to be present even though the patient has recovered clinically but is no longer infectious.” \n Dr Leong said one possibility is that Wuhan hospitals discharge Covid-19 patients who seem well but are not completely cleared of the virus.  \n “If you look at Singapore’s data on coronavirus, some people stay in hospital for 28 days not because they are sick for 28 days. They stay for 28 days but maybe sick for 10 to 14 days. \n “As for the rest of time, they are waiting for the test to turn out negative. Singapore hospitals make sure it is negative twice before they are being discharged,” Dr Leong explained.  \n In China, a need for hospital beds, as well as a lack of PCR testing equipment could have pushed the authorities to adopt this procedure of discharging patients who have not been tested negative for the virus.  \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — For six months from March 2, companies in the manufacturing and services sectors will be able to hire work permit holders from China who are already in Singapore, without having to wait for them to exit the country first. \n Right now, the law allows companies in these two sectors to hire Chinese work permit holders only after they have left Singapore. This is because when work pass holders leave a company, their work permit must be cancelled and they must leave the country, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) stated on its website.  \n MOM said in a statement on Tuesday (Feb 25) that it has partnered the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) to introduce this temporary measure to give companies in the two sectors more flexibility to manage their manpower needs amid the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak.  \n “Companies facing a shortage of manpower can save on search and recruitment expenses. At the same time, companies that have excess manpower can provide their workers with an opportunity to continue working in Singapore and save on repatriation costs,” it said. \n MOM and SBF will facilitate the transfer of Chinese work permit holders between companies in the same sector. \n Companies in the construction, process and marine sectors are already allowed to hire such workers before they exit Singapore. The latest move extends the scheme to manufacturing and service companies. \n SBF's chief executive officer Ho Meng Kit said: “This initiative will benefit all parties — companies that require additional workers to meet their business needs, companies that are looking to release their workers, and workers who find themselves displaced due to the Covid-19 outbreak.” \n Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, assistant director-general of the National Trades Union Congress, said that there are some small- and medium-sized enterprises that have a surplus of manpower now and other companies who have workers who are unable to return to China. \n “We are also mindful that some of these workers may still be paying off their loans, so this move would give them a chance to continue to work,” he added. \n The scheme is extended to all companies in the manufacturing and services sector, and not just to SBF members.  \n Interested companies can approach SBF and it will help employers looking to release their Chinese work permit holders connect with other employers who are experiencing a shortage of manpower.  \n Companies can only hire or transfer existing Chinese work permit holders within the same sector.  \n Should a connection be made, SBF will inform MOM and the hiring company can submit a work permit application to the ministry.  \n Mr Jack Wong, chief financial officer of engineering and skill training firm Wong Fong Industries, said that his company would ”definitely” be tapping the scheme, but said that he would still face the challenge of training new workers in a short span of time.  \n The firm has 13 Chinese work permit holders still in China, out of a total of close to 300 workers, who are primarily Chinese nationals and Malaysians. Though he cannot provide any figures, he told reporters on Tuesday that the company “does feel a drop” in production.  \n “(The scheme) helps in the overall management of the business. But of course, you will take some time to bring these (new) workers up to speed.”  \n He said that it can take at least three months to train a worker from the same industry, which would eat into the duration of the six-month scheme.  \n “Those from the same sector, if they are trained properly, they will need less (time to train), but there are certain skill sets they still need to conform to, such as safety.”  \n ",

You cannot send them home, because they might infect others, but you cannot put them in hospital because resources are stretched.\" \n Researcher Xiang Nijuan from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention was on Friday quoted by state broadcaster CCTV as saying that monitoring of those who have had close contact with patients should be expanded to a wider pool of people, because some patients had been contagious two days before the onset of their own illness. \n In the southwestern city of Chengdu, a patient initially discharged on Feb 10 after meeting the standard for having recovered, was readmitted to hospital nine days later when they tested positive again during a check-up. \n In another case in Changde, a city in Hunan province in central China, a woman tested positive on Feb 9, five days after she was released from quarantine at a local hospital having tested negative in two previous laboratory tests. \n Meanwhile, in the southern city of Guangzhou, the coronavirus was found in stool samples from a small number of discharged patients, South Metropolitan Daily reported on Saturday. \n \"It may be that there are still viruses or viral gene fragments in the discharged patients,\" Dr Cai Weiping, head of the infectious diseases department at Guangzhou No 8 Hospital, was quoted as saying. \"It is not yet certain whether they are infectious. This is a new pathogen, and we don't yet have a perfect process to understand it.\" \n But examples of this could not be classed as relapses, Dr Cai added, since CAT scans showed that the discharged patients' lung inflammation was receding. \n In China, patients can be discharged if they meet four criteria: body temperature returning to normal for more than three days; respiratory symptoms improving significantly; chest CAT imaging showing significant improvement in the lungs; and negative results in two nucleic acid tests at least one day apart.

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON - One scientific post suggests links between the new coronavirus and AIDS, a second says it may have passed to people via snakes, while a third claims it is a pathogen from outer space.  \n The emergence in China of a new human coronavirus that is causing an epidemic of flu-like disease has sparked a parallel viral spread: science – ranging from robust to rogue - is being conducted, posted and shared at an unprecedented rate.  \n While speedy scientific analysis is highly useful if it's good, flawed or misleading science can sow panic and may make a disease epidemic worse by prompting false policy moves or encouraging risky behaviour.  \n A Reuters analysis found that at least 153 studies - including epidemiological papers, genetic analyses and clinical reports - examining every aspect of the disease, now called COVID-19 - have been posted or published since the start of the outbreak. These involved 675 researchers from around the globe.  \n By comparison, during the 2003 SARS outbreak, it took more than a year for even half that number of studies to be published https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-RESEARCH/0100B5ES3MG/index.html.  \n Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet group of science and medical journals, says he's instituted \"surge capacity\" staffing to sift through a flood of 30 to 40 submissions of scientific research a day to his group alone.  \n Much of this work, according to those watching its flow and content, is rigorous and useful. Vaccine developers, clinicians, diagnostic makers and policy agencies have snapped up genetic codes, phylogenetic trees and epidemiological models to help them start work on catching the virus and containing its spread.  \n But much of it is raw. With most fresh science being posted online without being peer-reviewed, some of the material lacks scientific rigour, experts say, and some has already been exposed as flawed, or plain wrong, and has been withdrawn.  \n \"The public will not benefit from early findings if they are flawed or hyped,\" said Tom Sheldon, a science communications specialist at Britain's non-profit Science Media Centre.  \n   \n \"PREPRINTS\"  \n The threat posed by the new coronavirus requires that information be shared quickly and freely \"without being yoked to peer review\", Sheldon said - and that is causing problems.  \n The outbreak has in particular encouraged \"preprints\" - the practice of researchers immediately posting online their findings without external checks, scrutiny or validation.  \n The Reuters analysis scanned material on Google Scholar and on three preprint servers bioRxiv, medRxiv and ChemRxiv. Of the 153 studies identified, some 60% were preprints.  \n Preprints allow their authors to contribute to the scientific debate and can foster collaboration, but they are not peer-reviewed and can also bring researchers almost instant, international media and public attention.  \n \"Some of the material that's been put out - on preprint servers for example - clearly has been... unhelpful,\" said The Lancet's Horton. \"Whether it's fake news or misinformation or rumour-mongering, it's certainly contributed to fear and panic.\"  \n BioRxiv has now added a yellow banner warning label across the top of any new coronavirus research which reads: \"A reminder: these are preliminary reports that have not been peer-reviewed. They should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice (or) health-related behaviour, or be reported in news media as established information.\"  \n One example was work by scientists in New Delhi, India, who on Jan. 31 posted research pointing to what they called \"uncanny\" similarities between the new coronavirus and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.  \n The work was criticised by scientists around the world and swiftly retracted, but had already featured in more than 17,000 tweets and been picked up by 25 news outlets.  \n Another was a submission sent to The Lancet by a researcher working in Britain who claims the source of the new coronavirus may be \"viral in-fall\" from outer space.  \n And a study published online in the Journal of Medical Virology on Jan. 22, now known as \"the snake paper\", led to a rush of rumours that the China disease outbreak may be a kind of \"snake flu\". Leading genetic experts cast swift doubt on the paper's findings, but not before it had gone viral.  \n  \n PRESSURE  \n Part of the problem is pressure. To be first with a scientific finding is good for profile and for future funding - especially in the context of a fast-developing international disease outbreak.  \n \"Due to the evolving nature of the (coronavirus) outbreak, scientists are often under pressure to communicate their findings in real time,\" said Efstathios Giotis, an infectious disease expert at Imperial College London.  \n All research claims ought to be rigorously and independently scrutinised by experts in the field, but that is often not happening with work on the new coronavirus, Giotis said.  \n Magdalena Skipper, editor-in-chief of Nature, said her group of journals, like The Lancet's, was working hard to \"select and filter\" submitted manuscripts.  \n \"We will never compromise the rigour of our peer review, and papers will only be accepted once ... they have been thoroughly assessed,\" she said.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Amid expectations of a substantial package to help Singapore cope with the Covid-19 outbreak, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat unveiled during this year’s Budget statement not one, but two special packages totalling S$5.6 billion to help firms and workers, as well as households. \n The packages dwarf the S$230 million package introduced during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2003, and significantly exceed analysts’ expectations. \n They comprise a S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package which will “stabilise the economy and support our workers and enterprises”, as Mr Heng put it, and a S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package to help households with cost of living. \n The special packages come on the back of lacklustre economic growth last year — 0.7 per cent, the weakest since the 2008 global financial crisis. \n On Monday, the Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its economic growth forecast to between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, down from 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. \n In his Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 18), Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, noted that Covid-19 hit Singapore “just as the global economy was beginning to recover”. \n “The outbreak will certainly impact our economy,” said Mr Heng, adding that this is especially so since Singapore’s economy is now much more integrated with the economy of China, where the virus originated.  \n The Government is monitoring the situation and it is ready to do more if necessary to help Singaporeans cope with the economic impact, Mr Heng reiterated.  \n Comprising broad-based measures, the two packages will also feature targeted support, with the less well-off and industries more impacted by the outbreak getting more help. \n   \n  \n BROAD-BASED HELP FOR FIRMS, WORKERS  \n JOBS SUPPORT SCHEME  \n Under the Stabilisation and Support Package, a S$1.3 billion Jobs Support Scheme will be rolled out to benefit all enterprises and their local employees which total more than 1.9 million people. The Government will pay for 8 per cent of the wages of these workers, up to a monthly cap of S$3,600 for three months, said Mr Heng. \n This scheme will help businesses retain Singapore workers and will be given to employers by the end of July. The measures are directed toward Singaporean citizens and permanent residents, as well as both full-time and part-time hires. \n ENHANCED WAGE CREDIT SCHEME \n The Wage Credit Scheme currently co-funds wage increases for Singaporean employees earning a gross monthly wage of up to S$4,000. \n The cap will be raised to S$5,000 for qualifying wage increases given in 2019 and 2020. The Government will also co-fund five percentage points more, raising the levels to 20 per cent for wage raises in 2019 and 15 per cent for those in 2020. \n The enhancement will cost the Government another S$1.1 billion, benefitting 90,000 enterprises and more than 700,000 Singaporean employees, Mr Heng said. \n OTHER INITIATIVES  \n A corporate income tax rebate at the rate of 25 per cent of tax payable, capped at S$15,000 per firm, will also help all tax-paying companies in Singapore. This will cost the Government S$400 million. \n “We will also support tenants and lessees of government-managed properties,” said Mr Heng. \n Tenants and lessees under the JTC Corporation, the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Singapore Land Authority, the Singapore Tourism Board and the Sentosa Development Corporation will receive help with rent, including more flexible rental payments. \n Firms can apply to the relevant agencies which will assess each request individually. \n Several tax treatments under the corporate tax system will also be enhanced for one year, such as allowing a faster write-down of investments in plant and machinery, renovation, and refurbishment under the 2021 year of assessment. \n “This will put more cash in the hands of our enterprises. For example, hotels can now take advantage of this lull period to carry out upgrading work, and be better prepared for the rebound,” said Mr Heng. \n To help enterprises access working capital more easily, the working capital loan component under the Enterprise Financing Scheme will be boosted for one year, with the maximum loan quantum doubled to S$600,000. \n The Government will also bear greater risks for these loans, with its share of risk upped to 80 per cent from the current range of 50 to 70 per cent. \n “With the large part of the risk taken up by the Government, I trust that our financial institutions will do their part to support our viable SMEs (small- and medium-sized enterprises),” said Mr Heng. \n TARGETED HELP FOR SECTORS DIRECTLY HIT BY OUTBREAK  \n Additional help will be given to sectors directly affected by the outbreak — tourism, aviation, food services and retail, as well as point-to-point transport sectors. \n These sectors will be given help to retain and reskill workers. The funding period for reskilling workers through redeployment programmes under the Manpower Ministry’s Adapt and Grow initiative will be increased to a maximum of six months. \n Said Mr Heng: “Together with the Jobs Support Scheme, we will support employers in these sectors to retain and train more than 330,000 local workers. These workers can make full use of the down time for training and upskilling to prepare for the recovery.” \n For the tourism sector, a property tax rebate of 30 per cent will be granted this year to accommodation and function room components of licensed hotels and serviced apartments, as well as venues for Mice (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions). \n International cruise and regional ferry terminals will receive a 15 per cent property tax rebate, while integrated resorts will get a 10 per cent tax rebate. \n A temporary bridging loan programme for the tourism sector will also be rolled out for a year, with a loan quantum of up to S$1 million and interest rates capped at 5 per cent. The Government will also bear 80 per cent of the risk of the loan. \n The aviation sector will benefit from a range of measures, including a 15 per cent property tax rebate for Changi Airport, as well as rebates on aircraft landing and parking charges, assistance for ground handling agents and rental rebates for shops and cargo agents at Changi Airport. \n A Transport Ministry spokesperson said that the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on Singapore’s aviation industry has been significant, with more than 80 per cent of all scheduled flights between Singapore and mainland China cancelled. \n “There are now fewer than 80 services per week, compared with over 400 prior to the outbreak. Passenger traffic has dropped,” said the spokesperson, who added that traffic to Singapore from other regions has also started to decline. \n Food services and retail businesses will also receive rental waivers or rebates. Tenants at National Environment Agency-managed hawker centres and markets will get a full-month of rent waived, and other Government agencies such as HDB will provide a half-month rent waiver to their commercial tenants. \n Those that operate out of private properties will also not be left out — landlords will be granted a 15 per cent property tax rebate for commercial properties that qualify. \n “I strongly urge landlords to pass this on to their tenants by reducing rentals,” Mr Heng said. \n For the point-to-point transport sector, which include taxi operators and private hire car firms, Mr Heng noted that the Transport Ministry had recently announced a support package for these businesses. Many firms in this sector have come forward to support the initiative by matching the Government’s contribution, he added. \n Said Mr Heng: “This spirit of partnership is what we need to weather this challenging period together.” \n More details of the various measures will be revealed in the upcoming debates into the respective ministries’ budgets. \n Mr Heng added that he will elaborate on the S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package in the later part of his speech. \n S$800M BOOST FOR FRONTLINE AGENCIES \n Separately, apart from the two special packages, another S$800 million will be injected to support the frontline agencies dealing with the outbreak. The bulk of the amount will be channelled to the Ministry of Health. \n “This is on top of the substantial resources already committed each year to public health,” said Mr Heng, who then thanked all frontline officers who have been working tirelessly to fight against the outbreak — prompting other members of the House to thump their armrests in support.  \n Paying tribute to the group, he said: “You exemplify the resilience and indomitable spirit of our people. But please take care of yourselves. I am confident that together, we will stay strong and get through these trying times.” \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "HUBEI — These days, Ms Chloe Chang, a Taiwanese woman stranded at the centre of China’s coronavirus outbreak, says she wakes up every half-hour during the night. Sometimes she breaks down in tears. \n She and her family are effectively trapped in her grandmother’s apartment building, where a man recently died from the virus. Workers in hazmat suits haunt the surrounding streets, and the neighbourhood has a strong police presence. \n There are shortages of food and other essentials throughout Yichang, the Hubei province city of more than 4 million where they have been in limbo for weeks. \n “No household can go out at this time,” said Ms Chang, a 26-year-old industrial artist. She said she feared that even a trip for groceries would increase her chances of contracting the virus. \n “My child has eaten nine meals of plain noodles in the past three days,” she said of her 2-year-old son. \n Ms Chang and her family thought they were on the verge of escaping Yichang earlier this month, but the bus taking them to the airport was abruptly turned around. \n All she can do now is wait — and hope. \n “The government of Taiwan surely will come to our rescue,” her husband, Mr Calvin Fan, who is from Beijing, has reassured her. But the chartered flight they have eagerly awaited to evacuate them has yet to materialise. \n “Neither side wants us,” Chang said. “We’ve given up. Now we are refugees.” \n Taiwan and China each say the other is the reason that she and other Taiwan citizens are unable to leave Hubei, a province under lockdown, where hundreds have died from the coronavirus and tens of thousands have been infected. \n Ms Chang and hundreds of other Taiwanese people in Hubei had hoped to go home via chartered jet. But last month, after the first plane carrying evacuees landed in Taiwan with an infected passenger onboard, a backlash ensued on the self-governing island, which China claims as part of its territory. \n Some said Taiwan would not be able to handle an outbreak if more infected people arrived. Others said Taiwan should not help to evacuate mainland Chinese spouses of Taiwan residents. \n Decades of tensions between the two governments have come to a head over the outbreak, and people like Ms Chang and her husband — both of who arrived in China last month to celebrate the Chinese New Year holiday with family — have become pawns in a complicated and dangerous game of political chess. \n Ms Chang said she was told by Chinese officials that she could return to Taiwan on a second chartered flight, scheduled for Feb 5. That day, her family boarded a bus bound for the airport in Wuhan, the provincial capital, where the coronavirus first emerged. \n But just as the bus was about to leave, she said, a Chinese official hopped on and announced that the flight would not take off, saying: “Taiwan won’t let you go back.” \n “I was really devastated,” Ms Chang said. \n Taiwan had a different explanation. According to officials there, reports in Chinese state media that said a flight was scheduled to leave were untrue — the two sides had never discussed it. \n Both governments, and their proxies, have continued to point fingers while Ms Chang and her compatriots languish in Hubei. \n “Taiwan authorities have repeatedly delayed the schedule,” Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency, said last week. “Let the Taiwan compatriots return home as soon as possible, and stop making up all manner of excuses and rationale to block them from returning.” \n Mr Chen Shih-Chung, Taiwan’s minister of health and welfare, said Friday that “China still uses all excuses to delay the evacuation, and refuses our plans and suggestions.” \n Fears of the virus — and, perhaps, anti-China sentiment — have led Taiwan to escalate preventive measures in recent days. \n On Wednesday, Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Centre announced that children who have mainland citizenship but a Taiwanese parent would not be allowed to enter Taiwan for the time being if they were arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau. \n Confined to her grandmother’s home for so long, Ms Chang has turned to her art as an outlet for the helplessness and resentment she feels. \n In a satirical cartoon she recently sketched, she portrayed the administration of Ms Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s president, as deliberately delaying the evacuation. \n She depicted the Taiwanese in Hubei as pawns.

        "news_content_translate_en": "TAIPEI — While China deploys stern communist slogans in its battle against a deadly new coronavirus, democratic Taiwan has embraced cuddly mascots and humour to ease public anxiety and educate on best practices. \n Images of cute animals have featured in daily social media updates from government agencies to tackle disinformation and prevent the spread of infections. \n The health ministry has deployed a cartoon \"spokesdog\" — a Shiba Inu called Zongchai — that has proved a hit with hashtags of his name going viral and posts shared hundreds of thousands of times. \n Recent contributions have included advice on hygiene and quarantine regulations as well as reminding people to use face masks judiciously given the ongoing shortages since the new virus exploded in China. \n \"Leave face masks for the people who need them, frequently wash your hands with soap, reduce touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your hands,\" read one update.  \n A photo illustration shows a man displaying a smartphone with an image of a cartoon of Taiwan's Premier Su Tseng-chang promoting the prevention of the deadly Covid-19 coronavirus, in Taipei, on Feb 14, 2020. Photo: AFP \n In a Valentine's Day message, Zongchai offered practical advice for dating during an outbreak, from regular hand washing to staying sober and practising safe sex. \n The post ended with a question: \"What if I am single?\" to which the pup quipped: \"Stay home then!\" \n The foreign ministry has rolled out a pigeon in a facemask to announce entry restrictions on foreigners with recent travel history to China, adopting the slogan \"Virus OUT, Safety IN\". \n 'SO QUACKING EXAGGERATED' \n The economic affairs ministry plumped for a goose when it announced that rumours of disposable paper meal boxes running out were \"so quacking exaggerated\".  \n The message deployed a homophone where the word for the noise a goose makes sounds similar to the first character for the word \"exaggerated\" in Mandarin. \n The approach contrasts with the Chinese mainland where authorities have tapped their well-oiled propaganda powers to wage a \"people's war\" against a virus that has killed nearly 1,800 people. \n State media has heralded the importance of patriotism to tackle the outbreak in a campaign reminiscent of Mao Zedong's cries to mobilise the masses.  \n \"To visit each other is to kill each other,\" read one slogan in a quarantined district in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak. \"To get together is to commit suicide.\" \n Despite its cultural links and close proximity to China, Taiwan moved swiftly against the outbreak, quickly restricting and then banning arrivals from the mainland.  \n A photo illustration shows a man looking at the webpage from Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Facebook account of Taiwan's Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (centre) holding a placard to promote the prevention of the deadly Covid-19 coronavirus. Photo: AFP \n The island — which Beijing views as its own territory and keeps frozen out of the World Health Organization — recorded its first death on Sunday (Feb 16) but has kept confirmed infections to just 20. \n There was brief panic buying of face masks before authorities limited each person to just two face masks every seven days using health insurance cards. \n The island has also restricted the number of face masks a person can take abroad to 250. Last week, the coast guard stopped a fishing boat for attempting to smuggle out 71,000 masks. \n The ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which is loathed by Beijing for leaning towards Taiwanese independence, has been deft at deploying cute memes to win public support. \n President Tsai Ing-wen won a landslide second term in January after an election where she regularly featured as an anime-style cartoon character in campaign literature. \n In a similar vein, Premier Su Tseng-chang took to his social media accounts in cartoon form this week to warn against panic-buying toilet paper. \n \"We only have one butt, don't hoard, don't trust rumours,\" the post read.  \n Once again, a clever homophone was deployed. In Mandarin, the first characters for \"hoard\" and \"butt\" are pronounced the same. AFP \n ",

Our sign-up page is here. \n  \n Worries over coronavirus infections coming in from abroad seemed of growing concern as imported cases of infections grew and countries considered further travel restrictions.  \n China reported today that while there were no new infections in Wuhan, where the outbreak began, imported cases surged by a record and accounted for all of the new confirmed cases in mainland China. In another move, the port of Fuzhou in eastern China began restricting vessels arriving from nine countries in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus by visiting ships and their crew.  \n The Philippines announced today it is stopping the issuance of visas to foreigners to contain the outbreak. \n Singapore, on Wednesday, announced that all Singaporeans and residents returning to the country will have to serve a 14-day isolation period. This came on a day when the number of new cases spiralled to 47, an all-time high. Of these, 33 cases were imported and of them 30 involved Singapore residents returning from abroad. \n Two days ago, India shut down the Taj Mahal and other popular tourist locations and expanded its travel and visa restrictions to include travellers from the European Union, Turkey and the United Kingdom. In Japan, the revelry was missing as the country's famed cherry blossom season, that usually attracts visitors from around the world, was officially declared as having started on March 14. \n Also read:  \n Airfares soar 174% as Chinese flee Europe    \n What is a stay-home notice, and what should you do if you are affected?  \n New evidence shows young people are falling seriously ill \n  \n China is reaching out to European countries to share its knowledge and expertise on Covid-19. But some observers say this is Beijing's attempt to improve its global standing, at a time when both are not on good terms with the Trump administration.  \n Some European countries are showing appreciation. China's aid and assistance comes at a time of growing concern as Europe becomes the new epicentre of Covid-19.   \n Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump riled China by insisting the virus originated in China and there was nothing wrong in calling it a \"Chinese virus\". And in a surprising turn of events, the adviser to the Hong Kong government said that it was okay to refer to the virus as the \"Wuhan coronavirus\" in a column. But he had to withdraw the article soon after.  \n Read also:  \n Is the US-China relationship near breaking point?

Global Affairs Correspondent Jonathan Eyal shares his view: Covid-19 response shows up Europe's disunity \n  \n Indonesia succeeded in convincing organisers of a large religious gathering in the country's South Sulawesi to cancel the event that was due to begin today.  \n But fears that it could increase the number of coronavirus infections in the country persisted as more than 8,000 people from the region, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere had already arrived in the provincial town of Gowa, near the city of Makassar.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SHANGHAI (REUTERS) - The existence of a substantial but unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that people could still be spreading Covid-19 without knowing they are sick. \n As the virus continues to wreak havoc across the world, China is close to declaring victory and is already easing travel restrictions. \n The border of Hubei province, epicentre of the virus, opened on Wednesday (March 25) after a two-month shutdown. \n But there are concerns that the end of the lockdown will release thousands of infectious people back into circulation. \n Asymptomatic cases present a huge challenge in the control of infectious diseases, making it harder to detect and stop transmission. \n In China, the number of known asymptomatic cases is classified, and it is not included in the official data, though the South China Morning Post, citing unpublished official documents, recently said it was more than 40,000. \n China had reported 81,218 coronavirus cases, and 3,281 deaths by the end of Tuesday. \n Asymptomatic cases are currently found through \"contact tracing\". China identifies people exposed to someone with a confirmed diagnosis, and if they test positive, they are quarantined whether or not they manifest symptoms. \n \"Asymptomatic patients have all been discovered during our contact tracing,\" said Dr Wu Zunyou of the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention at a briefing on Tuesday. \n \"So will they be able to create transmission? They won't.\" \n Still, the failure to include them in the official data has raised concerns about Beijing's commitment to transparency, and some experts say it could also create a misleading picture about how the epidemic spreads and whether or not it is under control. \n Despite recording zero new infections from last Wednesday to Sunday, the Covid-19 hot spot city of Wuhan disclosed last Friday that one newly diagnosed case was not included in the official data because the patient, a 62-year-old man surnamed Zhang, had shown no symptoms. \n Citing hospital sources, the news magazine Caixin also reported that a new case in Wuhan on Tuesday was a doctor who had been infected by an asymptomatic patient. \n China says asymptomatic patients will be added to the list of confirmed patients if they show symptoms at a later stage. \n But it remains unclear how many asymptomatic cases remain undiagnosed and therefore unquarantined. \n Some experts warn that undetected, asymptomatic patients could create fresh transmission routes once lockdowns are eased. \n \"It is especially concerning given that many countries have yet to implement sufficient levels of widespread community testing,\" said Mr Adam Kamradt-Scott, a public health specialist at the University of Sydney. \n It is also unclear how much they might infect others. \n \"We know that that is possible, but we do not believe that that's a major driver of transmission,\" said Dr Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organisation at a briefing early in March. \n New studies show that asymptomatic carriers could pose risks. One analysis of the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak showed that 33 of the 104 infected passengers remained asymptomatic even after an average of 10 days of observation at the Self-Defence Forces Central Hospital in Japan. \n While many appeared healthy throughout, a few other initially asymptomatic passengers quickly became seriously ill. \n Another study published on Monday, looking at cases in the south-western Chinese city of Chongqing, said 18 per cent of patients were asymptomatic. \n Another even found that people are more likely to transmit the disease when symptoms are at their mildest. \n The Yale School of Public Health said the existence of pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic patients meant that screening procedures at airports and other points of entry were insufficient to prevent the coronavirus passing from China to other countries. \n \"The real picture will only come to light when we have a serological test to find out who has been infected,\" said Dr Ian Henderson, director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at Queensland University. \n ",

Between March 17 and 20, some 12,000 medical personnel departed the province. \n But the infectious disease prevention and control team has stayed behind, after Hubei's provincial Covid-19 task force on Friday ordered it to remain until central authorities say otherwise, Caixin has learned. \n According to a person at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, this team of specialists was kept in Hubei because the central government continues to feel unease about the situation in the area, in part because of the presence of asymptomatic individuals. \n Since February, the Covid-19 prevention and control policies issued by the National Health Commission (NHC) have stipulated that asymptomatic infected individuals are not considered \"confirmed cases\" and that their numbers should not be released. \n However, given numerous studies suggesting that this group is infectious, the NHC has required that, once detected, they be subject to a 14-day quarantine and lab testing, recategorising them as \"confirmed\" cases only in the event they develop symptoms. \n Caixin previously obtained data that showed Northeast China's Heilongjiang province had 480 \"confirmed cases\" on Feb 25, but had also discovered 104 asymptomatic infected individuals that it left off the public tally. \n A March 6 preprint - a study that has not yet been peer-reviewed - by Chinese and American researchers suggested that asymptomatic cases and those with mild symptoms could account for at least 59 per cent of Covid-19 infections, potentially undetected and fuelling its spread. \n Considering Wuhan is the epicentre of China's epidemic, \"there's still a lot that needs to be investigated and traced\", the infectious disease prevention and control team member said. \n This story was originally published by Caixin Global. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING (AFP) - As the rest of the world is engulfed in the coronavirus pandemic, China says it has turned the tide against the disease that has killed thousands of people. \n From initial attempts to cover up the outbreak to later locking down cities and now declaring it \"basically curbed\", here is a look at how China grappled with Covid-19: \n The first case emerged in the central city of Wuhan on Dec 8 before several workers at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market began to fall sick with fever. \n On Dec 31, Wuhan health authorities announced 27 cases of suspected viral pneumonia linked to the market and notified the World Health Organisation. \n But officials insisted there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission and that it was \"preventable and controllable\". \n A day later, eight people were reprimanded by Wuhan police for \"spreading rumours\" about the then mysterious disease. \n There had been social media talk of a re-emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), another coronavirus which killed nearly 650 people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. \n Dr Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, was among those punished for raising the alarm. \n The number of cases in Wuhan jumped to 44 on Jan 3 and health authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore issued travel alerts. \n China announced the existence of a \"new type of coronavirus\" on Jan 9 and the first death two days later. \n But between Jan 5 and Jan 17, China reported no new cases of the virus, while Japan and Thailand declared their first infections. \n During this time, Wuhan and Hubei province pressed ahead with their annual legislative meetings despite the outbreak. \n Meanwhile, doctors were ordered to keep quiet about the virus and evidence of human transmission they had seen, according to an interview with Dr Ai Fen, one of the earliest medical whistle-blowers on the outbreak and a colleague of Dr Li. \n An annual mass banquet for 40,000 families organised by Wuhan authorities went ahead on Jan 18. \n The same day, Beijing sent a team of scientific experts to Wuhan to investigate. \n On Jan 20, President Xi Jinping ordered that the virus be \"resolutely contained\", in his first public comment on the issue. \n Human-to-human transmission was finally confirmed by a leading Chinese expert that day. \n This marked a major turning point in the epidemic, with 291 infections reported nationwide. \n Panic took hold in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, when it was abruptly placed on lockdown on Jan 23. The rest of Hubei province was sealed off in the following days. \n Wuhan hospitals, inundated with patients, reported dire shortages of medical supplies. Many who could not get timely treatment for themselves or relatives relayed personal tragedies on social media. \n The virus spread as hundreds of millions of people travelled across the country and abroad for the Chinese New Year holiday before travel curbs were imposed. \n On Jan 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a \"global emergency\". \n Between Feb 1 and Feb 7, cases in China ballooned from 11,791 to 31,161, while deaths reached 636. \n On Feb 7 the Wuhan medical whistle-blower Dr Li died from the coronavirus, triggering a wave of public grief and anger. \n Many grievances against the authorities were swiftly censored on social media. \n Days later, four high-profile local officials were purged and replaced to appease public disquiet - including the Communist Party secretaries of Wuhan and Hubei. \n The province recorded a huge jump of 14,840 new infections on Feb 13 due to a change in diagnostic criteria, raising questions about the credibility of China's data. \n Mr Xi, usually a ubiquitous presence on state media, remained out of the spotlight. \n But on Feb 15, Beijing released a speech by Mr Xi showing he had urged officials to contain the outbreak as early as Jan 7 - well before the authorities announced human-to-human transmission - in an attempt to boost the leader's public image. \n In late February and early March, the number of new cases in Hubei and other parts of China steadily declined as outbreaks flared up in Italy, Iran and South Korea. \n On Tuesday (March 10), Mr Xi visited Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began, suggesting the Communist Party was confident it had the situation under control. \n Wuhan officials touted the sealing off of all residential estates from Feb 11 as \"critical\" in curbing the spread in the city, although some experts believe it led to more cross-infections within households. \n After more than 4,600 deaths and 126,000 infections across the country, China is now trying to reshape the global narrative in response to overseas criticism, casting itself as a leader in the heroic fight against the virus while other countries struggle to cope. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SHANGHAI (BLOOMBERG) - The coronavirus epidemic is accelerating a shake-out in China's property sector as a cash crunch forces distressed developers to throw in the towel. \n With lockdowns across the world's most-populous nation entering their third month, smaller home builders are being pushed to the brink because they can't get enough money from pre-sales of apartments to cover their costs. \n In the first two months of this year, around 105 real estate firms issued bankruptcy filing statements, after almost 500 collapses in 2019, data compiled by Bloomberg show. \n \"A vast number of mid- to small-sized developers will face a choice no one wants to make - either sell their property assets and start another business, or be bought out,\" China Index Holdings Research Director Huang Yu said. \n \"The shake-out is just beginning.\" \n Even before the new coronavirus, China's housing market was under pressure. \n Home prices rose at the slowest pace in almost two years in January and several developers, saddled with debt they're struggling to service, began to dial back on construction. S&P Global Ratings said in a note on Tuesday (March 10) that as Covid-19 spreads, the squeeze may be felt most acutely by Chinese banks and property firms. \n As a result, mergers and acquisitions among the nation's almost 100,000 real estate companies will ramp up again in 2020, Mr Yu said, declining to put a number on the expected deal value. \n \"Declining sales will hurt developers' liquidity, as the proceeds still form the largest and most important funding source,\" S&P credit analyst Christopher Yip said, noting that with construction largely paused, delivery schedules and revenue recognition are being pushed further out. \n \"Several companies already in the CCC category or with low ratings with negative outlooks may face liquidity issues.\" \n New York-based Avenue Capital Group, a firm that trades distressed debt and invests in special situations, said a China home market in flux spells increasingly versatile buying opportunities. It's looking at scooping up soured developer debt and buying troubled real estate projects at a discount. \n \"There'll be more bargains appearing on the market,\" said Wang Yifeng, Avenue Capital's Shanghai-based head of China. \"If you see a distressed seller among the country's top 100 firms, don't be surprised.\" \n Construction Halted According to S&P, new home sales in China will register their first drop in 12 years this year, with transactions down as much as 15 per cent. That's if the virus reaches a turning point this month. If the nadir isn't until April, sales could be down around 20 per cent, akin to the hit taken during the 2008 global financial crisis. \n Fusheng Group is one of the first mid-sized developers to falter. The debt-laden company, based in China's southeastern Fujian province, was in talks to sell a 70 per cent stake to a consortium led by Shimao Property Holdings, people familiar with the matter said in December. \n Local media reported in January that a new joint venture has been established, with Fusheng injecting its jettisoned property projects into the fresh vehicle. Shimao is one of the nation's biggest developers. \n Representatives from Fusheng didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment. \n Cash flows of less competent players have been sliding for years and the virus is only making matters worse, according to Wu Rui, an executive director of non-performing assets at private equity firm CDH Investments Fund Management Co. Asset-management companies are teaming up with top developers and eyeing such businesses, he said. \n In Hubei alone, the epicentre of the virus, there are around 4,300 developers. Home prices in Hubei's provincial city Wuhan rose at one of the fastest paces in the world last year, Knight Frank data show. \n To the north, in central Henan province, the general manager of one small developer said the only target his company had set, in early February, was to make all of its debt repayments over the next six months. \n Another manager at a small developer based in Zhejiang, a province in China's east, said the firm was two months away from bankruptcy. Its four projects under construction are halted because of the virus, he said. \n \"The epidemic could actually be a fresh opportunity for big developers,\" said Liu Ce, who's in charge of growth strategy at another large homebuilder, Shenzhen-based Kaisa Group Holdings. \n \"We can pull many levers to alleviate cash flow stress. Once you live through that, you see the wave of asset offloading by small players as a good chance.\" \n Kaisa became the first, and only, Chinese developer to default on its US dollar debt in April 2015. It went through a huge debt restructure and spent years rebuilding its balance sheet and credit rating. \n Now, it's regained investor confidence; Kaisa has already sold US$1.2 billion (S$1.67 billion) of bonds this year and in January, bought a site in Hong Kong's New Territories for HK$3.5 billion (S$630 million) to expand its foothold in the city. \n But while the likes of Kaisa, Shimao and China Evergrande Group have hundreds of property projects nationwide, the majority of China's developers are small and unlisted, with sometimes just a handful of projects in one city. They're the ones most at risk from the twin forces of coronavirus and a slowing market. \n Smaller developers also typically do not rely on bank loans or bond sales to alleviate funding concerns. Instead, they count on inflows from apartment sales, as well as shadow financing. \n Policymakers have so far refrained from unleashing wholesale monetary stimulus measures for real estate firms, fearing that could result in a surge in home prices. Most support has come from marginal easing by local governments. The central bank reiterated earlier this month that real estate \"definitely\" won't be used to stimulate the economy. \n Shenzhen on Wednesday allowed builders to draw on some cash deposits, which are usually held in reserve by banks during construction to ensure developers don't abandon projects. Still, local officials stressed the current home-buying restrictions won't be loosened. \n Coronavirus may be the \"straw that broke the camel's back for many small builders\", said Xie Yangchun, an analyst at China Real Estate Information Corp. \n \"A new wave of industry consolidation has started.\" \n ",

Separately, eastern Zhejiang province donated thousands of boxes of protective gear to help overseas Chinese in the European nation. \n In the phone call on Tuesday (March 10), Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said the two nations' friendship would see new progress as they work to tackle the fast-spreading virus. \n Mr Di Maio briefed on Italy's latest development on the epidemic prevention and control work, and thanked China for its support for Italy. \n Pointing out the severe situation in Italy at present, Mr Di Maio said the Italian government is paying close attention to and learning from China's successful experience in the battle against the virus, taking strong measures to prevent the spread of the disease. \n Italy is facing a shortage of medical supplies and equipment, said Mr Di Maio, expressing hopes that China would help resolve their urgent need. \n Overseas Chinese living in Italy have played an active role in the fight against the epidemic, said Mr Di Maio, adding that Italy will continue to take full care of their health and safety. \n Mr Wang said that as a good friend and comprehensive strategic partner of Italy, China fully understands the challenges Italy is confronting. \n The epidemic knows no border and is a common enemy of mankind, Mr Wang noted as he called for solidarity from the international community to combat the virus. \n Upholding the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, China is dedicated not only to making all-out efforts to keep the Chinese people safe and sound, but also to making contributions to global public health security, Mr Wang said. \n China recently made donations to the World Health Organisation to support international cooperation on the Covid-19 fight. China is also offering help within its capacity to countries where the epidemic situation is severe or where medical conditions are poor, Mr Wang said. \n Noting that the Chinese people will not forget Italy's support when China was facing its toughest moment in the fight against the virus, Mr Wang said China is now willing to stand firmly by the side of the Italian people. \n Though China itself at present still needs a large amount of medical materials, the country, overcoming the difficulties, will offer Italy with assistance like medical materials including face masks, and accelerate and enhance the exports of supplies and equipment to meet Italy's urgent need, Mr Wang said. \n If the Italian side requires, Mr Wang said, China would like to send medical personnel to Italy to help combat the novel coronavirus. \n The Chinese cities and provinces that enjoy friendship relations with their Italian peers, as well as Chinese enterprises, will also offer support and aid to Italy, the minister added. \n Mr Wang said he believes the joint battle against the coronavirus will help deepen bilateral relations between the two countries, and enhance the friendship between the two peoples. \n China appreciates that the Italian side has paid high attention to the health and safety of the Chinese nationals in Italy, and hopes that Italy will continue to offer them necessary help and support, the minister said. \n Hand in hand, China and Italy will prevail over the epidemic eventually, Mr Wang added. \n On Wednesday, China's eastern Zhejiang province sent 3.86 million pieces, or 4,556 boxes, of protective gear to help overseas Chinese in Italy. \n A cargo plane loaded with 26.4 tonnes of disposable masks, N95 medical masks, goggles, latex gloves and other protective clothing left the provincial capital of Hangzhou for Europe at 5.50am, Xinhua reported.  \n Zhejiang’s first batch of donations for overseas Chinese came from people from all walks of life in the province. More than 300,000 Chinese people from Zhejiang live in Italy.  \n “Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus, overseas Chinese of Zhejiang origin have tried every means to purchase epidemic prevention materials and support their hometown to fight the epidemic,” said Mr Zhang Weiren, vice-chairman of the Zhejiang Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. “Overseas Chinese are now in difficulty, and their relatives in the motherland should give them the utmost support.\" \n Due to the suspension of direct flights between China and Italy, the donations would arrive first in Liege, Belgium, and then be transferred to Italy, said Mr Gao Kaiyong, deputy chief of the general office of the Zhejiang Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. \n “If all goes well, the goods will arrive in Turin, Italy, this weekend,” \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "JAKARTA (THE JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - As more countries record new cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus, Indonesia's claim of being virus-free continues to raise doubts as questions persist over the effectiveness of monitoring and testing efforts of local health authorities. \n The country only allows one lab, run by the Health Ministry's Health Research and Development Agency (Balitbangkes), to test swab samples of suspected Covid-19 patients. \n As of Saturday (Feb 29), it had tested 143 samples taken from people who had shown symptoms or had travelled to infected countries. All were reportedly negative. \n However, the government did not test the 237 citizens and one American spouse of an Indonesian national who were evacuated from Wuhan and other cities in China after a 14-day quarantine in Natuna, Riau Islands. \n The government claimed they had already been declared virus-free when leaving China, so it was unnecessary for them to be tested again. \n Instead of being more vigorous and deploying more resources in conducting health monitoring and tests, the government later announced it would allocate Rp 72 billion (S$7.2 million) for promotional purposes - partly for so-called social media influencers - to attract foreign tourists to Indonesia and help revive the country's tourism, which has been battered by the outbreak. \n But this kind of blind optimism wins nobody's trust, especially from the international community. \n Several foreign nationals who transited in Indonesia have tested positive for Covid-19. They might have contracted the virus in Indonesia and it does not rule out the possibility that the country has become a vector of the disease. \n Saudi Arabia has banned Indonesian pilgrims from going on umrah (minor haj), even though Indonesia has not declared any confirmed cases of infection. \n A document circulating among foreign diplomats obtained by the Sydney Morning Herald pointed out that the inadequate transportation of specimens was among the concerns that led them to doubt Indonesia's virus-free status. \n Countries have escalated measures to mitigate the virus. The New York Times reported that measures would be expanded throughout the United States, which has tested 500 patients, following a flaw found in the tests that were only performed by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. \n One person has reportedly died of the virus in the US. \n Malaysia has tested 1,092 cases as of Feb 24, while South Korea has tested over 60,000 people as of Thursday (Feb 27). \n There is no reason for Indonesia to do less or overstate its coronavirus status. It would be more useful for all resources, including funding, to be allocated to help improve public health efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus. \n Thorough testing and observation should be conducted on returning crew members of the World Dream and Diamond Princess cruise ships, who will be quarantined in Sebaru Island, North Jakarta, as well as travellers coming in from countries that have reported positive cases as the virus has become even more widespread. \n It's better to be safe than sorry. \n The Jakarta Post is a member of The Straits Times media partner Asia News Network, an alliance of 24 news media organisations. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "As the new coronary artery, known as covid-19, is increasingly seen as a product of us biological warfare, a group of Iranian doctors in a letter to the regional president called for the complete destruction of us biological laboratories throughout the region.\nAs we all know, almost all countries in the world have been seriously affected by the rapid spread of new coronary aneurysm (covid-19). We, a group of doctors in Iran, experts in infectious diseases, lung diseases, asthma and allergies, are witnessing how many of our compatriots are infected with this terrible virus, and we are doing our best day and night to save this patient, Like all doctors in other countries.\nBut a lot of evidence and news have been published in the world's famous scientific articles and media, citing genetic and biological experts as well as WikiLeaks documents This reinforces covid-19's hypothesis of genetic manipulation in biological laboratories and the hypothesis of biological attack by the virus in the United States.\nIn the most serious position Monday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said there was evidence that American scientists had produced and disseminated new coronary arteries (covid-19) in 2015. The United States involved China in collecting information about new coronary arteries. Chinese scientists found an article published in the Journal of natural medicine in 2015 in their archives, which pointed out that American scientists can find a new type of coronary artery that directly affects human beings.no\nLadies and gentlemen, given the controversy over the role of the United States in the production of new coronary arteries, it is important to take into account Washington's poor record in the use of biological weapons, In order to make a correct and comprehensive decision in this situation, and to protect human life and prevent future people from blaming us or you for the silence and ignorance that this major crime in human history may bring.\nThe history of biological attack in the United States can be traced back to the biological weapons research and development project led by a civilian organization (military reserve bureau) led by President Franklin Roosevelt at Frederick concentration camp in Maryland in 1942. This war strategy is on the agenda to deal with countries that threaten the interests of the United States.\nThe United States has launched several attacks in different parts of the world, producing biological weapons, such as anthrax, francelia tullensis, the bacterium that causes the rabbit fever, Brucella, the bacterium that causes the Maltese fever, and Coxiella burneti. Causes of Q fever; Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus; botulinum toxin; Botox and cholesterol B enterotoxin; and Ebola virus. In addition, there were chemical attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nRegrettably, the country endangers the lives of its citizens in order to test its biological weapons. As an example in 2008, the U.S. government office He confirmed that dozens of civilian missiles could be attacked by biological warfare agents as a result of various tests, including the so-called \"project 112\" in 1962.no The army denies any contamination, but the evidence provided by these people shows that some of them have been suffering from infectious diseases for many years.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (CDC) according to the degree of risk, the microbial agents used in biological weapons are divided into three categories: A, B and C, and the viruses are classified as H1N1 influenza, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Category C includes emerging and highly pathogenic microorganisms, which may change with biotechnology due to their availability and easy reproduction and transmission, and thus are used in biological weapons as lethal organisms.\nOne reason covid-19 can be seen as a biological laboratory production is its unusual similarity to SARS. SARS is a serious respiratory disease originated in China. In 2002, it infected more than 8000 people around the world, resulting in 774 deaths. SARS is one of the diseases proved to be caused by gene manipulation. The disease is a severe respiratory syndrome, starting with high fever, cold winter, headache, fatigue and anemia. Later, the patient developed a dry cough, which may worsen, leading to dyspnea and a lack of oxygen in the blood. In the laboratory, chest X-rays showed pneumonia, and blood tests showed a decrease in the number of white platelets and white blood cells. Our observation in the hospital shows that the most common form of coronary heart disease is to cause cold, but in some cases, it causes severe respiratory syndrome, namely SARS.\n(Spanish TV News)",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Jose Gabriel Saraiva da Cunha, an infectious doctor and professor at Coimbra University Hospital Center, says Covid-19 is deadly, but it is not the greatest challenge to the health of the Portuguese that is circulating at the moment. What can be expected from Covid-19's behavior? Could he be mutating? We know that all viruses have the ability to mutate, but that is not necessarily bad. In other words, mutations in viruses do not make them more dangerous. Some mutations may, on the contrary, make them less aggressive. What we know about Covid-19 is little, and in this short time of evolution it is still not noticeable whether it has mutated or not. There are those who speak of two strains of this new coronavirus circulating... In the genetic sequencing already carried out it is concluded that there are indeed two Covid-19 lineages circulating. But we still do not know whether both strains are present in Portugal, or just one. We do not know whether the strain circulating in the North of the Country is the same as that present in the South. That will be known soon, once the genetic sequencing of the virus is completed. How long is it estimated that the outbreak of this Covid-19 could last? No one can answer that question. What we're doing is trying to isolate the infected, contain the advance of the virus. The measures proposed so far are aimed at delaying the spread of the epidemic until summer, when it will be easier to fight because of the heat and good weather. There is already talk of a vaccine, which could be ready by the end of this year. Is that a possible goal to achieve? It is possible, yes, to think of a vaccine for the new coronavirus by the end of this year. The production of vaccines depends on the clinical trials that can be carried out, which are always complicated and time-consuming processes. Especially when the approval and marketing part arrivesYeah. However, given the urgent need to monitor Covid-19 as soon as possible, it is only natural that procedures should be rushed and that authorisations should appear sooner. We can't expect a vaccine in a 15-day or a month. But by the end of the year, I think it's feasible, yes. Is this a particularly deadly virus? It depends. Compared to what? When we compare Covid-19 to the common cold, which we have every year, yes, it is a more deadly virus. But it is much less deadly than bacterial pneumonia, for example. What can be done, as a prophylactic measure, to prevent infection? Everything the Board of Health has recommended. Sneeze to the elbow, throw away used disposable wipes, take your hands often, maintain a certain social distance. All this is correct and must be observed.\nCASOCarl Goldman, a 66-year-old American \"I had a fever and drank a lot of liquids\" Carl Goldman, a 66-year-old, is one of the American tourists who became infected with the Covid-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise off Japan. On the same day that the American authorities took him to the Nebraska quarantine, he woke up in the middle of the night \"scalding.\" and was immediately placed in total isolation.\nIn an interview with ABC News, you said your symptoms were mild. In addition to the fever, I had a cough and was producing mucus, but all rather slight\", he recalls that he was placed in a contained pressure room and says he felt like\"a fish in an aquarium\".\nThe woman's test, Jeri, came back negative, what Carl went through through in the tough test alone. I had to drink a lot of liquids because it's one of the biggest problems with this new disease-- dehydration.\nElderly people are the main risk group Older people are the main risk group among coronavirus infectedYeah. According to the first major study on the effects of Covid-19 in China and based on the analysis of around 44 thousand cases, the mortality rate was significantly higher in the more advanced age groups, with particular incidence on patients older than 80 years.\nSimilarly, the study suggests that the number of fatalities is also higher in people with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular problems, diabetes, respiratory diseases or hypertension.\nThese factors can help explain the high number of deaths caused by the coronavirus in Italy, where, until yesterday, 463 people had died, for the most part over 60 years. Twenty-three percent of the Italian population is over 65 years old, making Italy the country of the World with the oldest population after Japan.\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, WHAT IS THIS NEW coronavirus? It was identified for the first time in December of 2019 in China, in the city of Wuhan. I've never been identified before in human beings. Infection may be similar to a common cold or present as a more serious disease, such as pneumonia.\nHow do you transmit the virus? Transmission routes are still under investigation. Person to person transmission has been confirmed, although no further details are known.\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of the disease? Infected people may show signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection such as fever, cough and difficulty breathing. In more serious cases it may lead to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory failure, renal failure and other organs and possible death.\nWhat is the incubation period of the virus? The incubation period is still under investigation.\nIs there a vaccine to fight Covid-19? There is no vaccine. As a newly identified virus, research into its development is ongoing.Yeah.\nIs it safe to get letters or orders from China? Yes, the World Health Organization considers it safe. To date, the ability to transmit the disease through contact with surfaces or objects is not known and therefore the precautions to be taken are those relating to general hygiene measures.",
