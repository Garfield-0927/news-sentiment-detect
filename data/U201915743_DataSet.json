The hospital will be ready in five days and for that, as evidenced by Sky News, China already has more than 30-day diggers and at least ten bulldozers on site. It is twenty thousand square meters that this Friday have begun to be terraced by dozens of lorries and hundreds of people are going to work there.\nThe video filmed with a drone and released by the British television channel and other media is impressive: a giant open-ended shell where several different colour machines move their metal arms and spin in various directions seemingly random. But this is unlikely because China wants the hospital to operate on Monday and the facilities will be able to afford at least 1000 beds.\n17 years ago, at the time of the SARS epidemic, another such hospital was built in Beijing. There are already 33 million people in quarantine and the idea of building a new specialized hospital is to centralize infected patients, replicating the situation of 2003 when the epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) occurred. Reports coming in from Wuhan show that the population is indeed frightened because the fear is that this new virus, which may have originated in snakes, will become as deadly as the SARS that killed 774 people in 17 countries.\n\"The idea of this new building is to fill the few medical resources that exist at the moment\nYeah. It will be pre-fabricated and so it will not cost much money and will not take long to build\", explains the Wuhan city officials to the official Changjiang Daily newspaper quoted by Sky News.\nChina announced this Friday the death of a person due to coronavirus near the Russian border. It is the second deadly victim outside the epicenter of the outbreak, precisely the city of Wuhan, raising to 26 the number of dead.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday confirmed a second U.S. case of the new coronavirus from China in a Chicago woman, and said as many as 63 potential cases were being investigated as the sometimes deadly illness continues to spread around the globe.\nOf the 63 people under investigation from 22 states, 11 have so far tested negative, CDC said on a conference call with reporters.\nNews of the woman in Chicago infected with the virus that originated in Wuhan, China, followed the announcement earlier this week of a man from Washington state who was diagnosed with the virus after returning from Wuhan.\nThe newly discovered virus has killed 26 people and infected more than 800. Most of the cases and all of the deaths so far have been in China, where officials have imposed severe restrictions on travel and public gatherings.\nThe virus has created alarm, but there are a still many unknowns surrounding it, such as just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can lead to pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.\n“CDC believes the immediate risk to the American public is low at this time, but the situation continues to evolve rapidly,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on the call.\nMore U.S. cases are likely, she added.\nDr. Julie Gerberding, a Merck & Co executive who was CDC director during the 2003 SARS outbreak, said it is too early to predict the course the disease.\n“I would caution against jumping to any premature conclusions about the severity of this because the epidemic is still unfolding,” she said in a phone interview.\n“As we learn from basically every new outbreak, we don’t know where it’s going to end up until it gets there.”\nThe 60-year-old woman from Chicago had traveled to Wuhan in December and returned Jan. 13.\nDr\n. Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said on a conference call that the woman is in stable condition and remains in an unnamed Chicago hospital primarily for infection control purposes.\nShe had not taken public transportation and was not ill when she traveled, Arwady said.\nA few days after arriving home, the patient began to feel unwell and called ahead to alert her doctor to her illness. The physician asked about her travel history, quickly put a mask on the patient, and directed her to a hospital with infection control capabilities, Arwady said.\nHospital staff performed a full clinical examination and worked with public health officials to arrange testing for the novel coronavirus at the CDC.\nDr. Michael Ison, an infectious disease expert at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, which is not caring for the patient, said the announcement of the second U.S. case means the system is working. “I don’t think the severity of the threat has changed,” he said.\nIn a local news briefing, Arwady said the health risk to Chicago residents remains low, adding there is no need for people to change their behavior in any way.\nThe World Health Organization on Thursday declared the virus an “emergency in China”, but stopped short of declaring it a global health emergency.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "1/OUTBREAK  \n Wuhan in central China is the size of London. But flights to and from the city are canceled, highways are shut and soldiers guard the railway station, as China tries to quarantine the center of a virus outbreak that has killed 81 people and infected thousands, spreading to more than 10 countries including the United States and Japan.  \n The government also extended the Lunar New Year holiday and more big businesses shut down or told staff to work from home in an effort to curb the spread.  \n Beijing's response has been reassuring for many compared to its secretive handling of the 2003 SARS epidemic. And the World Health Organisation says while this is \"an emergency in China\", it's not of international concern yet.  \n Still, it's unclear how deadly this illness is, or whether Beijing is revealing the full picture. Recent falls in share prices and the suffering yuan show markets are pricing slower growth and a monetary policy response. The outbreak coincides with the Lunar New Year holiday - a peak season for traveling, entertaining and gift-giving. If spending on such services falls 10%, Chinese growth would slow 1.2 percentage points, S&P Global calculates.  \n A higher death toll or more cases overseas will put global growth at risk. The SARS crisis almost halved Asian air passenger demand, inflicting losses on airlines and the hospitality industry. Oil's 7% fall last week and continued slide on Monday implies concerns for world growth are already building.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: Map showing places with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV - https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B589312/coronavirus-map.jpg)  \n  \n 2/LONG FAANGS  \n Over the December holidays, people across the world will have shopped on Amazon, watched Netflix shows and sent greetings over iPhones, Facebook and Gmail\n. Soon we'll see how this played out in the bottom lines of the firms that are grouped together as FAANGs and are collectively worth almost $4 trillion.  \n Q4 earnings from Netflix underwhelmed Wall Street. But Facebook should post 6.2% earnings growth on Jan. 29, while Apple earnings, due Jan 28, are forecast to have grown 8.7%. Amazon has warned that higher investment spending will dampen earnings-per-share but it sees quarterly revenues up 18.7%.  \n Alphabet (Google's parent), due the following week, should also post higher revenues but a 1.7% earnings decline.  \n Compare this with expectations for the S&P500 overall - 0.8% earnings decline and 4.4% revenue growth. The FAANGs also have led the U.S. equity bull run; just since October, shares in some of them are up 20-40%, versus 11% for the index. Any disappointments may sink more shares than just the FAANGs.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: Some FAANGs longer than others - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8249/8230/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 3/EUROPEAN CAR CRASH  \n World stocks celebrated the China-U.S. trade truce by speeding into a New Year rally. But European auto shares have crashed out on signs they will be first in the firing line if a trade war erupts with Washington. President Donald Trump's latest threat to raise tariffs on car imports from the EU sent shivers down the spines of executives, who are already struggling with tough regulation, slowing demand in key markets and competition with electric vehicles.  \n No surprise then that European auto shares <.SXAP> skidded to their biggest weekly fall since August, shedding 3.9%, even as the pan-European equity index returned to record highs. In fact, auto shares have decoupled from Germany's DAX index since late-2019, hitting 10-year lows relative to that benchmark.  \n Making matters worse is another profit warning from Daimler, and a Citi ratings downgrade for Renault. Interestingly, auto sector earnings are expected grow almost 10% in Q4\n. But investors are bracing for nasty surprises.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: Car pain - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1493/1468/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 4/BOE-ING  \n Britain leaves the European Union at the end of the week but the day will be little more than symbolic, given Jan. 31 only marks the start of an 11-month period during which a new trade agreement will have to be thrashed out with the bloc.  \n Of greater interest arguably, is Thursday's Bank of England meeting - Mark Carney's last as governor. The question is whether the BoE will join central bank peers in cutting interest rates. Economic growth and inflation took a hit from 3-1/2 years of Brexit uncertainty so a string of dismal data and dovish policymaker comment saw expectations for a cut swiftly build.  \n But money markets, having at one point priced a 70% chance of a quarter-point rate reduction, have trimmed those expectations to around 50%. Latest indicators, covering the period after the Dec. 12 election, suggest improving confidence. Sterling around $1.31, is in the middle of its trading range so far in 2020 - where it heads next hinges on the BOE's decision and forecasts for whether the economy will find more fuel when it starts a new life outside the EU.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: Money market expectations for BoE interest rate - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1494/1469/boe%20money%20markets.png)  \n  \n 5/FED WATCHLIST  \n The Fed must steer its first policy meeting of the 2020s between Scylla and Charybdis: U.S. stock indexes at nosebleed levels against Trumpian election-year pressure for lower rates.  \n The fed funds target will certainly be left in its 1.5% to 1.75% range on Wednesday; the central bank will want to see how the three cuts from 2019 are percolating through the economy. Also, considering fed funds spent the first half of the past decade near zero, there is barely room to cut more, without raising alarm about negative rates, deflation and asset prices\n.  \n A more immediate question is how long the Fed lets its banking system interventions run, now that the year-end has passed without any repo market turmoil. Its overnight operations will continue until at least mid-February but a debate is under way whether to establish a standing repo facility for banks. Investors will also watch for comments on the Fed's pivot back to balance sheet expansion.  \n Trump is likely to deliver his verdict too. Advance fourth quarter GDP lands Thursday - 2.1% growth is expected - and Trump might repeat his argument that were it not for Fed policy tightening, growth would be near 4%.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: Fed balance sheet - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8247/8228/Pasted%20Image.jpg) REUTERS\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "In China, it's new year's Eve, but it's not a good year for many families. In order to prevent the epidemic of mobile diffusion during the Spring Festival, by 12 o'clock on the 24th, 13 cities and regions including Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, had been shut down in terms of public transport, with an affected population of 40 million, an unprecedented scale. These cities are Ezhou, Xiantao, Zhijiang, Qianjiang, Huanggang, Chibi, Jingmen, Xianning, Huangshi (including Daye City and Yangxin County), Dangyang, Enshi and Xiaogan. After the closure of the city, Wuhan hospital was overcrowded, with a long line of emergency rooms and corridors full of people. There was not enough room for \"drop by drop\" and fever patients were no longer accepted. The grim situation has criticized the decision-making and resilience of Chinese officials.\nFang Fang, a famous Chinese writer, lives in Wuhan. She describes to Taiwan what she saw in Wuchang District of Wuhan on the eve of the lunar new year\nFang Fang: the common people must be very nervous now, and there is a bit of panic. The main reason is that the above measures are not very effective. Patients are the hardest, because there are not enough medical staff and beds in the hospital. The patients are in a long line, which is really very hard. The doctor told us that the family is the safest.\nI'm in Wuchang, a river away from Hankou, but the epidemic has spread. I went out this afternoon to buy masks. I had a special look. There were almost no people on the street. All the big shops were closed. Some small supermarkets were all open. The supply of products was quite sufficient. As usual, there were all kinds of products such as yoghurt masks. The supply of vegetables and fruits was also sufficient. There was no problem for the citizens in eating and drinking. The main problem is whether patients can get effective treatment. They have no beds, but they can't live outside. These measures are too late to isolate the infected people. Everyone is mobile, so this is a serious problem.\nAs for the news that Wuhan and 13 other cities were closed, Fang Fang, who lives in Wuhan, said that she was not very grateful, but what puzzled her most was the ability of officials to respond to major events and take effective measures, which was the key to the problem.\nFang Fang: I heard about the news of Fengcheng, but we don't have accurate official information,. I think these officials are too weak in their ability to deal with emergencies. There is no way to make people panic\n。 For example, there is a hotel opposite to Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital. They can completely isolate the hotel, let \"mobile\" patients live in the hotel, and let doctors go to the hotel for treatment, so as to avoid these people moving around and going home.\nIt often happens that the patient infects his family as soon as he gets home. The officials are not powerful, and they do not control the development of things, which is very deadly. In this regard, we will not criticize them now. When they come out later to apologize to the people, it has a great relationship with the ineffective handling of the official affairs. Political correctness kills people.\nIt's true that Fengcheng can effectively control the large-scale outward flow of the population from the main source of infection. However, it has been nearly a month and a half since the first outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan to the measures of Fengcheng. The people carrying the virus have spread to other places without knowing it, and the cases of pneumonia cluster infection in Wuhan are caused by the gathering of friends and families in the Spring Festival Is increasing. According to the Central News Agency, three patients in Tianjin have been colleagues, while in Guangdong there have been 10 cluster infections, all of which are family clusters. In response to the spread of the epidemic, seven provinces and cities including Beijing have also announced the launch of a major public health emergency level I response.\nWuhan is in a critical situation, and medical staff have been sticking to it for a long time. There are not only medical staff infection, but also fatigue caused by a small number of staff. Therefore, the news that many medical staff in Shanghai and other places have signed up to go to Wuhan to help moved Wuhan people. At the same time, Wuhan citizens spontaneously organized to solve the traffic problems of medical staff:\nFang Fang: Yes, the medical staff are very good. But the medical staff in Wuhan are too tired to support, so it's very touching to protect the medical staff now. The medical staff in Sichuan, Shanghai and other places are actively signing up, and the whole country is helping and paying attention to Wuhan. I went out this afternoon and saw that the street cleaners were still sweeping the street meticulously. It was raining. It was really touching to see these scenes. They don't have any protective measures or capabilities at all. The public transportation has stopped, but they are still working. I think these people are amazing, so when we see them, we will feel a little relieved. What we bear is nothing. We have cars and can walk around.\nAccording to another report, after the closure of the city of Wuhan, which has a population of 11 million, it has been reported that the medical resources are insufficient, and it is difficult for hospitals to receive patients with fever\n。 Fang Fang also confirmed that she also saw some unjust actions of drugstores to make \"disaster wealth\":\nFang Fang: it's mainly anti-virus masks. I went to buy 25 masks the day before yesterday, which cost nearly 900 yuan. The price was raised by sitting on the floor, but before they were packaged, the salesperson grabbed them directly by hand... But today I go to another shop, where I can buy an N95 mask for 10 yuan, and there are also independent packages, which are relatively safer. Masks are really out of stock. Many people are saying that they can't buy them, especially those with viruses.\nThere are many people in the folk who want to support Wuhan. I know a doctor who works in the Central South Hospital of Wuhan University. When I contacted him yesterday, he said that he was organizing some young doctors and asked them to actively participate in the front line. At the same time, he said that the government is also actively allocating private support, because the city is closed and private support cannot be delivered.\nThe streets are in good order. The common people are still very good. After the vehicles are stopped, many people organize to transport doctors and nurses to work. Some people live far away, and there is no way. Therefore, there are many organizations among the people who have signed up. But the authorities are really incompetent.\nIn addition, there is a big thing. Wuhan is building a small Tangshan model hospital, a place for centralized treatment. Now, the construction has started, and it is required to be completed in six days. You can see in the video that there is intense construction, and everyone is still working hard. In such a case, everyone will actively respond and participate. Escape and cheating are still rare. The common people are still very good. The main problem is leadership. They don't have the ability to make decisions and suffer. We also criticize them, but now is not the time for criticism.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "在中国国内，今天是除夕，但这个年对很多家庭来说都不好过。为防范民众春节期间移动扩散疫情，到24号12点为止，湖北已经有包括省会武汉在内的13个大小城市区域公共交通停运，受到影响的人口达4千万人，规模可谓前所未有。这些城市分别是：鄂州、仙桃、枝江、潜江、黄冈、赤壁、荆门、咸宁、黄石（含大冶市、阳新县）、当阳、恩施、孝感。封城后，武汉医院却人满为患，急诊室大排长龙，走廊上也坐满人，连“打点滴”的位子都不够，已经不再接收发烧患者。严峻的局面让中国官员的决断和应变能力遭到诟病。\n中国著名作家方方住在武汉，她向本台描述了她所见到大年三十武汉市武昌区的情况：\n方方：现在老百姓肯定很紧张，也有一点人心惶惶，主要还是上面措施不是很得力。病人最辛苦，因为医院医护人员不足，床位不够，病人排着长队，确实非常辛苦。没有生病的人就呆在家里，医生告诉我们家里是最安全的。\n我在武昌，和汉口有一江之隔，但是疫情已经蔓延开来了。我今天下午出去买口罩，专门在看了一下，街上几乎没有人，所有的大商店都关了门，一些小超市全部都开着，货源倒也蛮充足，酸奶口罩等商品和平时一样，还是应有尽有，蔬菜和水果供货也很充足，市民们在吃喝上是没有问题的。主要问题是病人能不能得到有效医治，他们即没有床位，但也不能在外边住。这些措施出台的太晚，没有把感染者隔离起来，每个人都是流动的，所以这是一个严重的问题。\n对于武汉和其他13个城市被封城的消息，住在武汉的方方表示不太之情，但最令她困惑的是官员遇到重大事件是的应变和采取有效性措施的能力，这才是问题的关键。\n方方：听说了封城的消息，但我们没有准确的官方信息，。我觉得这些官员应变能力太弱，在大事发生时的应变能力太弱了，让老百姓恐慌这件事就没有对策。比如，武汉中南医院对面就是一个酒店，他们完全可以把这个酒店断然隔离出来，让“移动”病人住进酒店里，让医生到酒店去治疗，这样就可以避免这些人到处流动，回家。\n经常发生的情况是，病人一回家就感染一家人。官方不得力，他们又没有控制事情发展，这是很要命的。对此呢，我们现在也不批评他们了，等他们以后出来向人民谢罪，发展到这一步和官方处理不得力有极大的关系。政治正确害死人了。\n的确，封城自然可以有效地控制主要感染源人口大量向外流动局面的发生，但由于从第一起武汉肺炎发作到封城措施，之间已经有近一个半月的时间，携带病毒的人群在不知情的情况下扩散到了其他地方，在年关朋友聚餐，家庭团聚之际导致武汉肺炎群聚感染案例在增加。据中央社报道，天津已经出现3名患者为同事，广东则累计有10起群聚感染，都是家庭聚集。为了因应疫情扩散，已有北京在内7省市也宣布启动重大突发公共卫生事件Ⅰ级响应。\n武汉情况危急，医护人员长期坚守，不仅有医护人员感染，人手少导致疲劳的情况也出现了，因此，在网络上看到上海等地不少医护人员报名要到武汉去协助的消息，让武汉人感动，同时，武汉市民自发组织起来解决医护人员的交通问题：\n方方：是的，医护人员特别好。但武汉的医护人员都累的快撑不住了，所以现在要保护医护人员，四川，上海等地医护人员都在积极报名，全国人民都在帮助和关注武汉，这一点很让人感动。我今天下午出去看到街上的清洁工还在一丝不苟地扫街，天还下着雨，看到这些情景真的是蛮让人感动的。他们根本没有任何防护措施和防护能力。公共交通都停了，但他们还在工作，我觉得这些人很了不起，所以看到他们就会心安一点儿，我们承受的也算不了什么，我们有车，还可以到处走动。\n另据消息报道，有1100万人口的武汉封城后，陆续传出医疗资源不足，医院难以接收发烧患者等状况。方方也予以确认，她也看到有些药店发“灾难财”的不义之举：\n方方：主要是防病毒口罩，我前天去买口罩，25个近900块，坐地涨价，还没有包装，售货员就直接用手抓......但是今天去另外一家小店，十块钱就能买到一个N95口罩，还有独立包装，相对来说更安全一些。口罩的确缺货，好多人都在说买不到，尤其是放病毒的口罩。\n民间有很多人希望支持武汉，我认识一个医生，他在武大中南医院工作，昨天和他联系时，他说自己正在组织一些青年医生，请他们积极投入到一线来。他同时也表示，对于民间的支援问题，政府也在进行积极调配，因为封城，民间支援运输不过来。\n街上秩序井然，老百姓还是很好的，交通工具停开以后，很多人组织起来运送医生护士上下班，有些人住得很远，没有办法，所以民间就有不少这样自己报名的组织。但是官方真是太无能了。\n另外还有一个很大的事情，武汉正在建造小汤山模式的医院，一个集中治疗的地方，现在已经开始动工，要求六天完工，视频里可以看到那边正在紧张施工，大家都还是很努力。这样的事情，大家都还是会积极响应和参与。逃跑和耍赖的情况还是很少发生。老百姓还是很好的，主要问题还是领导能力，没有决断能力，让老百姓受苦。我们也批评他们，但现在也不是批评的时候，只能共度难关。\n以上是本台对居住在武汉的作家方方的专访。感谢收听。\n",

Then go and see the doctor,\" the staffer said.\nOne 35-year-old man surnamed Li voiced the fears of many. \"I have a fever and cough, so I'm worried that I'm infected,\" he said.\nWith hundreds of millions of people on the move across China for the holiday, the government has halted all travel out of Wuhan, shut down its public transport and told residents to stay home. Deepening the isolation, there were few flights available to the city.\n\"This year we have a very scary Chinese New Year. People are not going outside because of the virus,\" a taxi driver in the city, who asked not to be named, told AFP.\nBut he said a prolonged shutdown should not pose food-shortage problems because many Chinese had stocked up for the holiday.\nBesides Wuhan, 12 other smaller cities nearby have battened down the hatches, with most of them going public on Friday with various measures ranging from closing public venues and restricting large gatherings to halting public transportat and asking citizens not to leave their cities.\nSeveral of the cities have populations numbering several million, led by Huanggang with 7.5 million.\nThe pathogen - 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) - has caused many outlets in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities to sell out their stocks of face masks.\nIn a sign Wuhan authorities are feeling the pressure, Hubei governor Jiang Chaoliang said in a meeting Friday that Wuhan must \"make every effort\" to increase isolation places and beds.\nHospitals must also make sure patients are \"admitted in time,\" according to a statement on the government's website.\nState broadcaster CCTV also reported that 40 medical doctors from the military were being brought in to help with intensive care.\nIn addition, 405 medical workers were being sent to Wuhan from Shanghai, said state news agency Xinhua, with the first set of 135 flying in Friday night\n.\nOn Friday, staff in full-body protective suits were seen checking the temperatures of people entering a subway station in Beijing.\nThermal cameras scanned passengers arriving at Beijing's West Railway Station.\n'Work as one'\nChinese authorities said the number of cases leapt overnight to more than 800, with 177 in serious condition. There were another 1 072 suspected cases.\nOfficials also said that a virus patient died in Heilongjiang province in China's far northeast, the second death outside the Wuhan epicentre.\nBeijing has been praised for its response in contrast to SARS, when it took months to report the disease and initially denied WHO experts any access.\nGao Fu, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, asked China's people to forego New Year gatherings this year and confine themselves at home until the all-clear.\n\"If we all work as one, we can contain the virus in Wuhan and add no more cases exported from Wuhan, so as to stem the virus nationwide,\" Gao told state TV.\nBeijing has cancelled popular New Year public events at temples in the capital, the historic Forbidden City will close from Saturday, and Shanghai Disneyland said it also will shut down for an indefinite period from Saturday to protect visitors and staff.\nA number of tourist spots were closed and events cancelled in central Hunan province, which borders Hubei province.\nThe crisis was given a prominent spot on the celebrated gala show on state TV Friday evening, the traditional Lunar New Year's Eve extravaganza broadcast by CCTV watched by hundreds of millions of Chinese.\nThe host told Wuhan medical staff \"We love you\" against a backdrop of hospital footage and stirring music.\n",

An early study called \"Colorado virus carriers of snakes\" was criticized by virologists from all over the world who interviewed reporters on nature.com.\nAn unknown viral pneumonia outbreak occurred in Wuhan, China on December 12, 2019. On January 7, Chinese scientists found that diseases can cause new coronaviruses. 2019-ncv isolated cases have been found in other Asian countries (such as Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore), It's also in the United States. Now, 26 people have died and more than 800 people have been infected by new viral pneumonia.\nTo prevent further disease, scientists are trying to determine how the virus enters the human body. The most likely source of viral pneumonia is snakes, especially, Chinese Cobra (1992) and southern hairy crab (1998)\nAbout Wuhan residents can get the coronavirus by buying the snakes at the Yellow Sea seafood market.\nThe authors of the new study disagree with their colleagues' conclusions. They analyzed lung fluid samples from six patients in Wuhan hospital. It was found that 96% of RNA in 2019-ncov samples matched RNA virus, which was previously found in Asian gravedigger bats.\nIn addition, China's coronavirus samples are similar to the SARS virus that began to epidemic in 2002, only 79.5% less.\nDespite these achievements, Chinese scholars point out that the new crown card Russia needs to be studied carefully, because experts do not know the exact number. How well and how well the virus can spread from person to person.\nCriticism of the international community\nAs a result, Chinese scientists do not use snakes as a source of new coronavirus at all. Other antiviral scientists, who interviewed earlier results on nature's website, suspected snakes could carry 2019 ncov.\nAccording to Cui Jie, a researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Shanghai, mammals are the most likely candidates for the role.\nAbout In 2017, he studied the SARS pathogen carrying bats in caves in Yunnan Province, China.\nJay pointed out that both the SARS virus and the pathogen of viral pneumonia in China belong to a subtype of virus - betacolone.

No worries have been exposed to the virus because \"we do not contagiamos young people so easily, but most people can not resist\" all deaths to date have been over 70 years.

Our country is now very powerful, unlike last. We have highly trained experts and academics. They control the outbreak, not to worry. \"\nOne of the reasons for the quarantine rules over Wuhan is its status as railway junction. The city has three railway stations: the Hankou is one of them.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and showed bluntly Saturday at an extraordinary meeting of the Standing Committee, the highest organ of the Communist Party, to discuss measures against the new coronavirus that has already caused the least 56 deaths and nearly 1,700 infections in this country.\nThe call was a sign of the seriousness of the problem and the seriousness with which Beijing has taken. Saturday celebrated the Lunar New Year, marked the day of the festive calendar in which under normal circumstances would be unconscionable to maintain a working meeting.\nBut these are not ordinary circumstances. The Chinese Government of its international and domestic prestige plays in the management of a health crisis reminiscent of SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome also caused by a coronavirus that in 2003 killed more than 700 people. So Beijing management was disastrous. Opacity and lack of information that was answered at first turned the focus on a major epidemic that cost 50,000 million dollars to the world economy.\nThis time, Beijing-and Xi, the most powerful leader in China since Mao Zedong era want to show they have learned the lesson then and the country responds as the great world power which has become since that time.\n\"China's leaders had to raise the level of [response to] the crisis to ensure the stability of Chinese society, and also the international reputation of China\", told Bloomberg researcher at the University Renmin Wang Peng . \"The virus has the potential to impact negatively on the image of China\".\nSince it was recognized that the virus had jumped out of Wuhan, the city where the infection originated and where they have declared most cases, measures have succeeded as fast as dramatically. Fifteen cities in Hubei province, including Wuhan, with a total population of 46 million people, have been blocked by quarantine. They have closed attractions, cinemas, interprovincial bus networks; canceled trips tourist groups; Wuhan are built in full swing two hospitals that treat exclusively infected with coronavirus; They have increased temperature controls at train stations or airports. If that city hospitals suffer from shortages, the order is to strengthen supplies. They have sent hundreds of doctors reinforcement.\nIn addition, the sequence of the genome of the 2019-nCoV, essential to achieve a vaccine was ready in a month since the first infection was detected; in the case of SARS, it was five months late. And, unlike 17 years ago, Xi himself has demanded maximum transparency in management. The State Council, the Chinese government has come to ask allegations of concealment or irregularities.\nMeasures have generated WHO praises: \"commend\" quarantine imposed in Wuhan, a \"decisive action\" to curb the spread of the contagion, said the secretary general of the organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nCriticism, the least in China, have been directed primarily against local authorities, especially the Mayor of Wuhan Zhou Xianwang, for failing to give sufficient importance to the outbreak of the outbreak. \"The first case was detected on 12 December. They could I have managed better. Not given all the information, \"recalls Chen Qiang, a computer 34 years living in Beijing and should have changed trains in Wuhan for your New Year's holiday on the tropical island of Hainan. In the end he chose to stay home.\nAmong the main criticisms of Wuhan residents the mayor is organizing a meal for 40,000 people which wanted to break a record this January, and that neighbors fear that has served to further spread the virus.\nZhou luck seems to be cast. The nationalist newspaper Global Times published this week that the city \"failed\" when it comes to contain the virus in the most early stages of the crisis. The Journal of the People considered that the statements from the mayor have \"sown panic\".\nSaturday's meeting of the Standing Committee did not seem very reassuring for alderman or the rest of the Hubei provincial authorities.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Since the Chinese city of Wuhan announced the first cases of coronavirus 31 December 2019, the figures already exceed 23,000 people infected and 490 dead worldwide, and the number of countries affected round twenties. Globally, the number of deaths is still well below other viruses such as seasonal flu. However, seeing that the transmission of the virus went beyond China's borders, the World Health Organization (WHO) finally declaring a global health emergency last Thursday.\nMeanwhile, scientists are trying to understand how this virus against the clock works, how to infect our cells and how it is transmitted between humans. Over the past 20 days, more than 50 reports have been published on the coronavirus, according to the journal Nature. Of these, more than half are in repositories \"pre-print\", ie servers that allow sharing scientific articles in open while are reviewed for publication in academic journals.\nIn an unprecedented agreement, more than 70 organizations (including large publishers such as Nature, Cell and The Lancet and institutions like the British Academy Medical Sciences or the National Institutes of Health US) have pledged to make public all his works, without waiting to be reviewed for formal publication. So, not only they are sharing all discoveries about the coronavirus with WHO, but are also available for anyone to read from anywhere in the world.\nBioRxiv is a repository that these days is publishing numerous studies on the nature of the coronavirus (20 last week), while his counterpart MedRxiv addresses aspects related to health (and has published 14 reports on this virus in the same period ).\nIn addition, scientists are putting the genetic sequences of the coronavirus available to the international community in real time. This collaborative momentum that has already been key years with the outbreak of SARS or swine flu early, it is also crucial today to assess the situation and guide policy actions. To date, the coronavirus is less lethal than SARS, for example. However, a certain mutation in their genome could dramatically increase its virulence.\nIn emergency situations is a priority to inform politicians and health quickly. The publication of an article in academic journals is a demanding process that involves months or years of work, delaying the arrival of the findings of a research group to the rest of the community. Now, the possibility of sharing before its formal publication allows reacting to epidemics in a coordinated manner and as they develop. \"Quick access to information is essential to contrast everything that is happening globally,\" says Ester Lazarus, who investigates evolution of virus at the Center for Astrobiology. That publications are freely accessible also it allows the scientific community to evaluate the work, whether or not subscribed to the magazine turn. \"These repositories eliminate access barriers while reducing delays, so they are a great way to accelerate scientific breakthrough,\" says Thomas Faust, scientific publishing Hindawi.\nThe Achilles heel of the \"pre-print\" repositories is its reliability, because the work has not previously been examined by other scientists, unlike those published in magazines. From BioRxiv and MedRxiv remember, with a note on each item, which is preliminary reports pending review. \"These repositories are an extremely valuable resource, but should be used with caution and responsibility,\" warns Faust. \"Readers should be aware that these studies have not checked with the rigor of the usual peer review in academic journals,\" he adds.\nThe BioRxiv himself published a study on the similarity of the coronavirus with the AIDS virus containing serious technical failures. However, scientists quickly detect these errors and the item is removed from the server and shows that the \"pre-print\" repositories are subject to the intense scrutiny of the scientific community. \"Immediate access to what they are doing other researchers and to discuss your articles in a fluid way I think the biggest advantage [of these repositories]\" argues Lazarus.",

        "news_content_translate_en": "On January 31, as a special Air India flight evacuated 324 Indians from Wuhan, Monika Sethuraman, 31, broke down in tears realising that she wouldn't be on the plane. \"I couldn't breathe for a few seconds...I am stuck here in the city, and it's now turned into a huge prison,\" she says over the phone from her one-room dormitory. The doctoral scholar in international relations at Wuhan's Central China Normal University had been instrumental in contacting the Indian embassy and arranging the evacuation of fellow Indians following an outbreak of the new novel corona­virus (2019-nCoV).\nFor Sethuraman herself, leaving Wuhan won't be easy now. \"I didn't go to the airport because I knew I would not be cleared for the flight out. Even if I recover from the cold, once you are on the blacklist, you will not be allowed to fly out,\" she laments. Since the transport lockdown on January 23, Sethuraman has stocked up on essentials. According to her, stepping out is futile. One will be spotted by a drone, the building security cameras or police, and sent back indoors. \"The authorities aren't interested in testing or verifying if you have the virus. They are only interested in control...it doesn't matter if we live or die so as long as the virus is contained,\" she says. \"I am foll­owing WHO (World Health Organization) guidelines, but there is no human interface to connect to. If people see you wiping your nose, they run from you, including the officials. That's the kind of panic and desperation here.\"\nThe travails of Vinay Ahuja, 38, who was visiting business associates in the region when the city went into a lockdown, are no different. \"Nobody expected it to escalate so quickly,\" he says, as he marks time before he gets permission to fly out. What Ahuja and many others are wondering is whether India would be able to replicate China's iron-fisted attempts to control the outbreak in a similar situation\n. China has been criticised by human rights groups, but received praise from WHO for its aggressive approach to control 2019-nCoV. The country built a 645,000 sq. ft emergency hospital in Wuhan in just 10 days. The two-storeyed hospital has 30 intensive care units (ICUs), 1,000 beds and special corridors to limit patient-nurse contact. A second hospital could be up by February 5.\nSeldom has an illness-largely a little-known respiratory disease-aroused such apprehensions as the 'corona', now part of the popular lexicon as a dreaded threat, eclipsing the pleasant connotations of being the aura around the Sun and a branded cold brew. First detected in December 2019, 2019-nCoV is a previously unidentified strain. It comes from the same family of viruses as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), which claimed 774 lives, including three Indians in 2002-03.\nThe situation in India is nowhere as grim as at epicentre Wuhan, though three cases had been confirmed until February 5, while 3,935 were under observation at isolation wards across the country, apart from the special camps for Wuhan returnees near Delhi airport. So, how prepared is India to handle the coronavirus in case the numbers spike?\nConsidering there is no vaccine or trial-proven drug therapy yet, aff­ected patients are being treated symptomatically based on clinical severity. \"Serious cases who have viral pneumonia will need supportive intensive care, including mechanical ventilation when required. Hospitals in large cities can provide this, if the numbers are not overwhelming. Small towns and rural areas in most states will be ill-equipped if the virus spreads further,\" says Dr K. Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI).\nThe public health system will have to go the extra mile to check the potential spread of the virus. Entry points to the country are being closely monitored to assess incoming travellers\n. There is still the danger of infected persons slipping through in the asymptomatic but infectious phase of the illness. Isolation of clinically-suspected cases is essential even where a specific virological diagnosis is not immediately available. Close contacts of affected persons are being advised clinical assessment and restricted mobility till the incubation period (up to two weeks) is over. \"Since the symptoms are not specific to this virus, a high index of suspicion is needed based on history of exposure to a proven/ likely case, even where laboratory facilities for a specific viral diagnosis are not readily available,\" explains Reddy. \"We have to educate the public with well-framed risk communication messaging and health advice, and all healthcare providers must follow the correct diagnostic/ clinical protocols.\"\nA comprehensive nationwide surveillance system is still a work in progress. While this network has expanded since the H1N1 virus threat loomed large a decade ago, competent labs are needed at more locations. In 2012, there was a proposal to set up 150 diagnostic and research labs with virology-related expertise. Of these, 80 are operable now, but this number is far from adequate. These are also not linked to the public health response system and only serve as support for ad hoc reporting.\nThough India has an integrated dis­ease surveillance programme in each district, this is done at a micro level and largely follows a symptomatic approach. \"We need case-based surveillance-where any suspicious disease outbreaks are reported to labs for real-time con­f­irmation. What we have is reporting at district levels based on extreme symptoms,\" says Dr G. Arun Kumar, head, Manipal Institute of Virology, one of four diagnostic labs under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)\n.\nDetailed investigations found that the SARS-CoV was transmitted from palm civets to humans in China in 2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) from dromedary camels to humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The animal source of the 2019-nCoV is yet to be identified. It's likely the source is a live animal market in China.\nLabs and the health system have also largely overlooked animal research and the risk mapping of India. There are several types of animal to human transmitted (zoonotic) diseases. They vary in terms of pathogen diversity (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths) and animal sources (bats, pigs, chickens, other birds, palm civets, dogs, fishes, crustaceans and snakes). India has fairly well-established programmes for monitoring zoonotic diseases like rabies, brucellosis and Japanese encephalitis. It is the threat of newer viruses, transmitted from wild or cap­tive bred animals, that is most worrisome.\n\"To identify the emergence and spread patterns of zoonotic pathogens, we need a 'one-health' approach, combining research data from wildlife, veterinary and human populations involving biology, epidemiology and clinical studies. Surveillance of wet markets, involving sale of animal foods, has to be strengthened. At the same time, research needs to identify entry points of zoonotic pathogens from outbreaks in other countries,\" explains Dr Reddy.\nAgencies such as the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the ICMR have advanced efforts in these areas. Yet, India is unequal to the task, be it handling an emergency or pursuing priority research. The weak links lie in inadequately integ­rated epidemiological surveillance of zoonotic pathogens in forests, close-bred veterinary clusters and human population groups. This is one of the reasons why Nipah claimed 17 lives in Kerala in 2018. The dearth of virologic and taxonomic studies on native bats made it difficult to understand the nature of the virus\n. However, the state has learnt from the tragedy. Kerala has declared 2019-nCoV a state calamity and has kept over 2,000 people under surveillance at their homes. \"This is to tighten vigil rather than create panic. We do not want to miss out on any case,\" says state health minister K.K. Shailaja.\nThis level of vigilance has not been replicated elsewhere. Despite India being in the top 30 countries at risk from the virus, there has been no statement from the minister of health and no central guidelines for detecting and controlling infection. In contrast, European countries began tracking down visitors from China and putting out strong public advisories two weeks after the outbreak. Precautionary guidelines for the public in India are yet to be widely disseminated, in English or in local languages.\n\"There are all kinds of misleading reports giving the public incorrect information to help cure the virus. Most people also do not know how to protect themselves, which masks to wear, and so on. Public education has been entirely neglected so far,\" says Chapal Mehra, a public health specialist in Delhi. \"We need a proactive approach, not a reactionary one. Large-scale screening of risk individuals has to be a priority. It's a challenge for our public health system, which is yet to come out with a strategic approach to the issue,\" he adds.\nA concerted multi-agency response, led by a competent public health system, is the need of the hour, but it is currently hampered by the limited expertise in the country. In the medium term, agile outbreak response systems have to be built, primary healthcare facilities (where clinical assessments take place) strengthened and vaccine development efforts advanced.\nIf the virus does spread here in the same magnitude as in Wuhan, the impact on the economy, healthcare and public morale could be catastrophic\n. With one of the world's highest population densities, especially in urban cities like Delhi and Mumbai, maintaining three-feet distance between individuals (as recommended by the WHO) will be impossible, nor will the lockdown of an entire city be feasible. Meanwhile, social media broadcasts by individuals in Wuhan paint a grim picture. Shortage of food and medicines, panic and misinformation, depression, even theft-the virus doesn't just destroy health, it destroys society. It's already visible in Kerala.

Chinese authorities said the toll in China rose by a record 64 from the previous day to 425, mostly in Hubei province of which Wuhan is the capital.\nNew cases were reported in the United States including a patient in California who was infected through close contact with someone in the same household who had been infected in China.\nIt marked the second instance of person-to-person spread of the virus in the United States after another such case was reported last week in Illinois.\nWe expect to see more cases of person-to-person spread, said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThe total number of infections in China rose by 3,235 to 20,438, and there were at least 151 cases in 23 other countries and regions.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency, although experts say much is still unknown about the pathogen, including its mortality rate and transmission pathways\n.\nSuch uncertainties are leading some countries to take extreme measures to stem the spread of the virus. Australia sent hundreds of evacuees from Wuhan to a remote island in the Indian Ocean, while Japan ordered the quarantine of a cruise ship carrying more than 3,000 people after a Hong Kong man who sailed on it last month tested positive for coronavirus.\nHundreds of medical workers in the former British colony held a second day of strikes to force the government to completely close the city’s borders with mainland China, a day after embattled leader Carrie Lam left three remaining checkpoints open.\nThe Asian financial center has confirmed 15 cases of the coronavirus, yet the city’s public hospital network is struggling to cope with a deluge of patients and measures to contain the epidemic.\nHong Kong was badly hit by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that emerged from China in 2002 and killed almost 800 people around the world. According to WHO figures, SARS killed 299 people in Hong Kong during that outbreak.\nChinese data suggest that the new virus, while much more contagious than SARS, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly.\nIn Wuhan, authorities started converting a gymnasium, exhibition center and cultural complex into makeshift hospitals with more than 3,400 beds for patients suffering from mild cases of the infection, the official Changjiang Daily said.\nThe United States said on Friday it would block nearly all foreign visitors who have been to China within the past 14 days, joining Australia, Singapore, New Zealand, Vietnam and others who have imposed similar entry restrictions.\nA day after accusing Washington of scaremongering, Beijing said it would welcome assistance from the United States to fight the outbreak\n.\nChina has noted that the United States has repeatedly expressed its willingness to provide assistance to China, and hopes that the relevant assistance will be provided soon, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement on the ministry’s website.\nThe White House said China had accepted its offer to have U.S. experts as part of a WHO mission to study and help combat the virus.\nWith Wuhan and some other cities in virtual lockdown, travel severely restricted and China facing increasing international isolation, fears of wider economic disruption are growing; sources at the OPEC oil cartel said producers were considering cutting output by almost a third to support prices.\nAirlines around the world have stopped flights to parts of China. A suspension by the United Arab Emirates on Monday will affect the Gulf airlines Etihad and Emirates.\nSome economists predict world economic output will be cut by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points due to China’s lockdown.\n",

Most of them have been in people who had recently travelled to or were visiting from Hubei.\nThe World Health Organization this week declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, but said global trade and travel restrictions are not needed.\nHowever, some countries are responding to fears of the virus spreading by ramping up border controls. Singapore and the United States announced measures on Friday to ban foreign nationals who have recently been in China from entering their territories, and Australia followed suit on Saturday.\nRussia introduced visa restrictions and will start evacuating Russian citizens on Monday and Tuesday, Interfax and TASS news agencies reported.\nMore than 100 Germans and family members landed in Frankfurt on Saturday after being evacuated from Wuhan. Around 250 Indonesians were being evacuated from Hubei.\nU.S\n. health officials on Saturday confirmed an eighth case of the coronavirus in the United States, and the Pentagon said it would provide housing for people arriving from overseas who might need to be quarantined. The country has introduced mandatory quarantine for citizens arriving from Hubei.\nIn Mexico, ride-hailing application Uber Technologies Inc said on Saturday that it suspended 240 accounts of users in Mexico who may recently have come in contact with someone possibly infected with the virus.\nThere are no confirmed cases in Mexico yet.\nPROVINCE IN LOCKDOWN\nThe number of deaths in Hubei from the outbreak had risen to 294 as of the end of Feb. 1, with a total 9,074 cases, the majority in the capital Wuhan, where the virus is thought to have emerged late last year in a market illegally trading wildlife.\nNew confirmed cases also surged by 276 in nearby Huanggang. One death was reported in the city, about 60 km (37 miles) east of Wuhan.\nHubei has been under virtual quarantine for the last week, with roads sealed off and public transport shut down. The province extended its Lunar New Year holiday break to Feb. 13 in a bid to contain the outbreak.\nBut the province is not totally sealed. People are leaving Hubei on foot over a bridge spanning the Yangtze river, entering Jiujiang city in neighbouring Jiangxi province.\nLu Yuejin, a 50-year-old farmer from a village on the Hubei side of the bridge, was trying to gain passage for her leukaemia-stricken daughter on Saturday.\n\"Please, take my daughter. I don't need to go past... please, just let my daughter go past,\" Lu pleaded with the police.\nHer cries for help were almost drowned out by a loudspeaker playing a pre-recorded message that residents would not be allowed past to Jiujiang.\nEventually, Lu and her daughter were both allowed through and an ambulance was called to pick them up.\n",

The total number of confirmed cases in China had risen about 30% to 2,744.\nUS S&P500 e-mini futures fell more than 1% in Asian trade on Monday on mounting worries the outbreak of the virus could severely disrupt the Chinese economy, an engine of global growth.\nKicking off the Asian trading day, New Zealand shares fell with travel and tourism-related stocks among the worst performers as the speed of the outbreak's spread raised alarm over its future impact on movement.\nChina's cabinet said it would extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday by three days to Feb. 2 in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. The Hubei city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, is already under virtual lockdown, with severe restrictions on movement in place in several other Chinese cities.\nBeijing has called for transparency in managing the crisis, after public trust was eroded by a cover-up of the spread of SARS, a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.\nThe newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because much about it is still unknown, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.\nThe virus, believed to have originated in a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife, has already spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai\n.\nHONG KONG BAN, GLOBAL SCREENING\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) last week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency, but some health experts question whether China can contain the epidemic.\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Saturday he was on his way to Beijing to meet officials and health experts dealing with the coronavirus.\n\"My @WHO colleagues & I would like to understand the latest developments & strengthen our partnership with China in providing further protection against the outbreak,\" he said on Twitter.\nChinese-ruled Hong Kong has six confirmed cases and said it would ban entry from Monday to people who have visited Hubei province in the past 14 days. The ban does not apply to Hong Kong residents.\nAirports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of these efforts.\nFrance, Italy, Japan and the United States all said they were working to evacuate citizens from Wuhan.\nFrance said it expected to repatriate up to a few hundred of its 800 citizens living in the Wuhan area. Evacuees would have to spend 14 days in quarantine to avoid spreading the virus in France.\nHubei's governor, Wang Xiaodong, said at a news conference on Sunday he felt \"agonised\" and responsible for the outbreak. He described the situation as severe and said medical supplies were still tight.\nNews of the press conference sparked anger on Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter, although social media platforms in China usually delete such sensitive content.\n\"He thinks one sentence of apology will be enough to solve the problem?

A U.S. charter plane departed Wuhan on Wednesday, said a U.S. official, but it was unclesar who was onboard.\nU.S. officials said the White House was weighing whether to suspend flights to the country in a drastic measure to control the spread of the disease.\n“All options for dealing with infectious disease spread have to be on the table, including travel restrictions,” said U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar.\nThe White House is holding daily meetings on the outbreak and monitoring China-U.S. flights as a likely source of infections, sources briefed on the matter said, though it had decided against suspending air traffic for the time being.\nA senior Trump administration official said airlines had not been asked to suspend flights, after CNBC reported that the White House had told airline executives it was considering such as move.\nFears of the spreading virus have already pushed airlines around the world to reduce flights to China and global companies to restrict employee travel to the country, while sectors from mining to luxury goods have been shaken by concerns for global growth in the event of a worst-case pandemic\n.\nChina’s National Health Commission said the total number of deaths from the flu-like virus rose by 26 on Tuesday to 132, almost all in Hubei province which is under virtual lockdown, while the number of confirmed cases rose by 1,459 to a total of 5,974.\nThe case number in China now exceeds the 5,327 who were infected in the country with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus which killed about 800 people around the world in 2002-2003.\nWhile some experts believe the new strain is not as deadly as SARS, it has created alarm because it is spreading quickly and there are still important unknowns surrounding it, such as its lethality and whether it is infectious before symptoms show.\nA chartered plane carrying 206 Japanese nationals evacuated from Wuhan arrived at Tokyo’s Haneda airport on Wednesday, with additional flights planned.\nA U.S. government official who declined to be identified told Reuters a U.S. charter plane had departed from Wuhan earlier on Wednesday, without elaborating on the number of passengers on board.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Beijing earlier said a chartered plane would pick up its consular staff and some private U.S. citizens on Wednesday.\nAustralia said it would help some citizens leave Hubei and quarantine them on Christmas Island, a remote speck in the Indian Ocean best known for housing asylum seekers.\nNew cases were reported around the world including Germany, where four people from the same company were infected in one of the first cases of person-to-person transmission outside China.\nThe German cases raise concerns about the human-to-human spread of the virus, which can be transmitted in droplets from coughs and sneezes and has an incubation period of up to 14 days.\nWuhan is racing to build two dedicated hospitals to treat coronavirus patients, with the first 1,000-bed facility to be completed on Feb 3. The capacity of the second will be expanded from 1,300 to 1,600 beds, the official People’s Daily reported on Wednesday\n.\nKnown as “2019-nCoV”, the newly identified coronavirus emerged late last year in Wuhan, a major transportation hub and capital of central Hubei province with a population of 11 million people.\nWhile China has since moved to lock down most of Hubei, with a population around the same as Italy, the virus has still spread to more than a dozen countries from France to the United States.\nThe epidemic broke out on the eve of China’s Lunar New Year holiday, a time when millions of Chinese travel abroad and at home. Many of those flights have now been cancelled, and airports around the world are screening passengers from China for signs of infection.\nIn a major step towards controlling the global spread of the disease, scientists in Australia said they had developed a lab-grown version of the coronavirus, the first to be recreated outside of China.\nThe researchers at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne said they would share the sample, grown from an infected patient, with the World Health Organization and laboratories around the world.\n“Having the real virus means we now have the ability to actually validate and verify all test methods, and compare their sensitivities and specificities,” the Doherty Institute’s virus identification laboratory head, Julian Druce, said.\nAsian stock markets erased earlier gains with Hong Kong shares tumbling to a seven-week low on Wednesday as the surge in new cases fuelled fears about the economic impact of the virus.\nPolicy sources have told Reuters that Beijing plans to set an economic growth target of around 6% this year from last year’s 6-6.5%. A Reuters poll of economists conducted earlier this month showed China’s economic growth is expected to slow to 5.9% this year, the weakest clip since 1990\n.

One image showed the message “farewell Li Wenliang” etched into snow on a riverbank.\n“Wuhan indeed owes Li Wenliang an apology,” said Hu Xijin, editor of the government-backed Global Times tabloid.\nRights group Amnesty International called his death a “tragic reminder” of how China’s preoccupation with stability made it suppress vital information.\nChina had been accused of trying to cover up the 2003 SARS outbreak that killed almost 800 people worldwide.\nThere were signs that discussion of Li’s death was being censored. After briefly trending on Weibo, the topics “the Wuhan government owes doctor Li Wenliang an apology” and “we want free speech” yielded no search results.\nThe virus has spread around the world, with 320 cases now in 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, a Reuters tally of official statements showed\n.\nWHO emergency expert Mike Ryan said reports of Asians being shunned in the West over a perceived connection to coronavirus was “utterly and completely unacceptable and it needs to stop.”\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd issued a statement on Friday saying: “Any guest or crewmen traveling from, to, or through mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau less than 15 days prior to their sailing will be unable to board any of our ships.”\nBut it did not stop there. It also said, “Any guests holding a Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passport, regardless of when they were there last, will not be allowed to board our ships.”\nChina has complained bitterly about bans and measures that go against WHO recommendations and accused governments and companies that take such actions of fear mongering.\nTwo deaths have been reported outside mainland China, in Hong Kong and the Philippines, but how deadly and contagious the virus is remains unclear, prompting countries to quarantine hundreds of people and cut travel links with China.\nFour sick passengers aboard a Royal Caribbean ship that arrived off New Jersey in the United States were sent to a hospital out of “an abundance of caution,” the local mayor said.\nThere were 41 new cases among about 3,700 people quarantined in a cruise ship off Japan, taking the total to 61, while Chinese-ruled Hong Kong quarantined for a third day a cruise ship with 3,600 on board.\n“A cruise ship is a very particular environment in which you can have higher levels of transmission even with a virus that isn’t very efficient at transmission,” WHO’s Ryan told a news conference in Geneva.\nThe head of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice, Li Fuying, told reporters that people deliberately concealing contacts or refusing isolation could be punished with death.\n",

The Indian government plans to send another special plane to China to evacuate overseas Chinese\n。\nIn addition, the central epidemic command center in Taiwan announced on Saturday that the spread of the new coronavirus epidemic to Guangdong province and the spread of the community were taken into account. From Sunday, the people of Guangdong could not enter Taiwan. At the same time, people who had been to Guangdong province and who had entered the country through small three links had to be segregated for 14 days at home.\nTaiwan's command center said it decided to divide the mainland's epidemic areas into two levels after the expert consultation. At present, Hubei Province is listed as the first level epidemic area and Guangdong Province as the second level epidemic area, which shows that it is suspected that there is community communication in the local area.\nAccording to Reuters, Kim Jeong-eun, the supreme leader of North Korea, sent a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping to express condolences to the epidemic caused by the new coronavirus. North Korea decided to provide financial assistance to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.\nThe Reuters quoted the Korean Central News Agency reported on Saturday that Kim Jeong-eun believed that under the guidance of Xi Jinping, \"the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government and the Chinese people will be sure to win the battle against disease.\"\nAccording to the decision made by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the labor party, the Central Committee of the labor party will provide financial assistance to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the report said.\nThe report also said that the Labor Party and the North Korean people regard the epidemic of infectious diseases in China as their own business, as a matter of family and flesh and blood, and convey to the Chinese side that North Korea is willing to share difficulties with the Chinese people.\nReuters reports that China is North Korea's closest ally in isolation. But with the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, North Korea took the lead in cancelling most of its flights to China, enforcing quarantine on all people from China to North Korea, and strictly restricting border exchanges between the two countries.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Franka Lu is a Chinese journalist and entrepreneur. She works in China and Germany. In this TIME ONLINE series she critically reports on life, culture and everyday life in China. To protect her professional and private environment, she writes under a pseudonym.\nAt the apparent peak of his power, the most powerful authoritarian regime in the world is shaken by a virus. This country, the People's Republic of China under Xi Jinping, is about to become a world leader in the development of quantum computers and artificial intelligence, it has excellent telecommunications technology, the fastest trains in the world, highly trained officials and a prestigious viral research. But all this is of little concern to the new Coronavirus.\nIts spread now exposes the weaknesses of the system mercilessly. China's bureaucratic health system was clearly not prepared for such a case. Overcrowded hospitals rejected patients, initially poorly protected doctors and carers even contracted the Coronavirus. And the question is long overdue, with the Chinese central government actually being more efficient in recent weeks: in controlling the outbreak of disease, or rather in controlling the population and the flow of information?\nIn times of social media, especially in China, where WeChat and Weibo are the big platforms instead of Facebook and Twitter, it is now clear that information shared by users on social media can only be controlled by means of censorship and thus deletion only conditionally. These users come especially from the younger generation, in the 1980s or after, whose members have never experienced such chaos\nYeah. These youngsters have grown up in the most economically happy decades of Chinese history and have benefited from the growing prosperity that their parents, in particular, have achieved and that is largely due to the globalisation from which China has benefited so unprecedented as a place of production. These young Chinese people have so far largely trusted the communist authorities. Their lack of response to the threat posed by the new Coronavirus now shakes this belief.\nIn the crisis, young people mobilise an unprecedented energy to help themselves, and they also often organise it through social media. They provide respiratory masks and bring them to hospitals; they provide medical personnel with cars; they help elderly and sick people trapped at home and try to support refugees from Hubei. Civilian society is making great efforts to fill the gap that leaves a lack of action on the part of the authorities and their obvious over-reliance on the outbreak of the virus.\nAt the same time, the existence of social media platforms allows something quite different: it is precisely thanks to them that an attempt can be made to reconstruct the events since the emergence of the new Coronavirus in China, as they have largely not been reported in the state media; also a report by Human Rights Watch, the 30th. In January, it supports these searches. These show how inadequate or even covert the authorities have acted at local and central level until at least mid-January.\nThe story of the spread of this virus began almost a month and a half ago as many disasters in China, as rumor\nYeah. When patients with identical symptoms arrived in a hospital at the end of December in the 14-million-city of Wuhan, doctors reported the cases to the local centre for disease care, a half-body. According to social media posts, their officials appeared on 27. In December \"very impatient\" in the hospital there and listened to the concerns of the doctors with great reluctance.\nThree days later, 30th. In December 2019, this precautionary authority communicated internally that all hospitals should be prepared for an \"unknown lung disease\", with doctors being \"strictly forbidden\" to give information to the public. Nor did the Authority itself inform the public. Doctors who did not work directly in the departments for fever and lung diseases were left in the dark about the possible seriousness of the situation and were therefore unprotected in dealing with possible Corona patients. Many of them later experienced how serious the situation really was.\nIn the afternoon and evening of this day, several doctors from different hospitals posted in their chat groups and WeChat diagnoses of their patients and expressed their concern about the inactivity of the precautionary authority. They warned colleagues of the dangers posed by the local fish and game market, which was soon suspected of being an outbreak. Doctors also explained that the symptoms of the expanding lung disease were reminiscent of Sars, the highly contagious, life-threatening infectious disease that had spread from South China at the end of 2002, early 2003. This information and internal government communication reached the public, screenshots from the chats spread virally. On Weibo, users started using the hashtag WuhanSARS. Their posts were quickly deleted from censorship.\nOn the morning of 31\nYeah. In December, one of the doctors who published the information on the new Coronavirus was appointed by the City Health Commission of Wuhan, the city's top health authority, WMHC. He had to reveal his sources. The next day, the party secretary's office asked the doctor for an apology for the \"spread of rumors\" and also for an assurance that from now on nothing would leak out. Then he had to take a warning from the police and sign it.\nOn the same day, for the first time, official media representatives came to the WMHC to obtain confirmation of the \"rumours\" that had been circulating for several days. Under increasing pressure, the WMHC was forced to make a public statement; the number of 27 cases of corona infection was officially confirmed. Afterwards, the top Chinese health authority, the NHC in Beijing, sent a group of experts to Wuhan. At the latest there had been reports of a possible mass-spreading disease in the Chinese capital.\nIn the meantime, the Wuhan fish and wildlife market continued to dominate. A journalist interviewed the dealers, where no one had heard of the virus. Wild animals were sold further. Only after this report appeared on the government's First Finance news page from Shanghai did the market become the first. January 2020 closed.\nAt that time there were already eight people who were investigated by the police for \"spreading rumors\" about the virus disease. News spokesmen announced the arrests on local and central government channels such as China Central TV with a stern face: \"The Internet is not a free space!\" No word was lost on what rumors the alleged culprits had spread.\nI have 11. Finally, in January, the physician initially admitted to hospital\nYeah. Diagnosis: pneumonia. The Coronavirus? Even more than two weeks later, the physician was still severely affected, he was not told about the medical findings on his own body. Many infected patients have suffered the same fate. Of the people who had already confirmed more than 200 to the consequences of the Coronavirus in China, at least initially, many apparently did not know what they were suffering from at all.\nThe Chinese government has long obstructed the search for the truth with ever-new blurring tactics. Officials threw out to the public only little information, dubious statistics, mixed with increasingly angry statements of determination to win the \"war against the plague\".\nA case of obvious cover-up is, for example, the fact that the city government of Wuhan of the 3rd. up to 15. In January, no new cases of infection reported as if the virus had been stopped by magic. Experienced observers were able to see through the spell: it happened to be precisely the days during which the People's Congress of Hubei Province was held in the city (Wuhan is the capital of Hubei). It was the same game as at the beginning of the Sars crisis in 2002/2003: at the time, however, the Beijing government had steadfastly denied the epidemic for months, in order to \"stability\" around the Peking National Congress in the spring. 17-years have passed since then without really passing.\nAn article from the specialist magazine The Lancet was published on 24th. January retroactive that on the 2nd. In January 41 hospital patients and patients in Wuhan submitted laboratory-based infections with the virus now called 2019-nCoV\nYeah. Five days before this publication, Wuhan's head of health care, Wang Guangfa, had told journalists that the new Coronavirus was \"not very contagious\", that the risk of transmission from person to person was \"low\". The disease can be \"prevented and controlled\". Where Wang Guangfa got his information and whether he himself did not already know better cannot be said. In any case, two days after the press conference, he himself became ill from this not very contagious disease.\nAnd People's Daily reported online that the cause of the diseases is not yet established, whether it is Sars or, more likely, a less dangerous disease. But even if it's saris, we have a sophisticated system of prevention and control. The people of Wuhan have no reason to panic.\"\nThe inhabitants of the city were calm and continued their holiday preparations. In the coming weeks, five million of them flocked to spend the end of January's New Year's Eve with their families. Thousands traveled abroad. Meanwhile, social media posts have been appearing in which people have reported strange diseases to their relatives or acquaintances in Beijing, Changsha, Shenzhen, Wenzhou, and soon to Japan and Thailand. The Chinese media froze. No one dared investigate these new cases. There was a loose tone in the state media, and the short reports on the disease highlighted the competence of the government and spread optimism.\nOnly in Hong Kong was the situation taken very seriously very early on. I got four. In January, seven suspected cases of the disease were reported. The government there immediately took strict precautions, with great transparency in information policy\nYeah. The relatively independent press played an important role in this. The television stations reported around the clock. Journalists and journalists were sent to the mainland of China to investigate, but some of them were immediately thrown out or questioned by the police.\nAlready at seven. In January, Starry Lee, chairman of the Beijing-loyal Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, then travelled to the Chinese capital and asked the central government to improve the flow of information around the epidemic. Among the relevant reports in online media, government trolls and patriots then came to them: \"Then you cannot demonstrate! You Hong Kong people are polluting the environment!\"\nWhen there was scarcely anything left to hide and embellish, the governments of Hubei Province and Wuhan continued to hold all kinds of galas and events for the celebration of the Chinese New Year's Eve. Still on 18th. In January, the city organized a feast for 40.000 families who cooked and ate together. The participants clearly believed the official slogans: trust the government! No one seemed aware of the situation that the Coronavirus could also celebrate a feast here.\nI got 19. In January, the state media suddenly announced with great Tamtam the return of a now 84-year-old hero from the fight against Sars in the 2003 year: Out of the blue Zhong Nanshan, lung specialist and former president of the Chinese Medical Association, was called to a medical-propaganda battle. He managed to squeeze himself into the dining cars of a fast-track in the south of Guangzhou. In Wuhan he was written and immediately continued to Beijing the next day to report to the health authority. Am 20\nYeah. In January, he confessed to journalists that the transmission of the virus from person to person was possible and at that time 14 representatives of the medical staff were already infected. After this brilliant interview, he went underground.\nOnly now did the media decide to ignore the government's seemingly existing muzzle. Brave journalists and journalists of the few remaining traditional media travelled to Wuhan to investigate on the spot. Many online rumors were confirmed: hospitals were actually overloaded and had to reject numerous patients, doctors and nurses were sick, officials had lied and concealed, there were apparently not enough test kits to test all patients for the virus.\nThe official news had said that hospitals had been supplied with at least 100.000 of these test kits, and patients were provided with 4.000 beds, while the number of confirmed infections and suspected cases were still in triplicate.\nYeah. But where were those test kits and the hospital beds? And where was the \"sufficient quantity\" of masks, gloves and protective clothing? How could the pleading calls from reputable hospitals from all over China for all this be explained?\nWhat about the heartbreaking appeals of children in social media who are desperate for treatment for their parents, grandparents and themselves? Who are the people in the online videos who just roll over on the street at the top of the hospital queuing up? What about the young woman who, in vain, tries to get one office after another to accept her grandmother's body at home? What about the doctor who breaks down and yells, \"Get rid of those lying in the hallway! Immediately!\" With the social-media viral video of the nurse crying hysterically during her lunch break?\nFor other things, the government agencies apparently had time and money: the best telecommunication technology in the world is said to have been used to monitor all mobile users in the province of Hubei and to report to other provinces the number of visitors from the endangered region. Some local authorities also reported their names, addresses and ID numbers. Travelers from Hubei were rejected in hotels. Some were misled on the open road, insulted or even beaten, it is reported. The local authorities prepared accommodation for the unwelcome refugees, but then failed to tell people where to find the accommodation.\nPeople have recognized the logic (or illogical) of the \"fight against the virus\" by now: In hospitals, even the admitted patients have apparently tested only part of the virus\nYeah. The relatively small number of confirmed infections (now officially over 17.000 people in China) that initially appeared to be relatively small due to the huge containment measures, for example in Wuhan, can be explained at least in part by this and also by that apparently just a lot of patients were rejected and not treated at all. The data and statistics transmitted from China to the Coronavirus should in any case only be believed with reservation.\nIn the Chinese network, the sick and their relatives, when they speak on social media, are now being harassed by trolls. They accuse patients of being simulators or enemy agents, demand proof of their plight and then discredit that evidence. An example is the case of a young woman who, like her father and grandmother, was infected and rejected by a hospital. She asked for help from a woman. Thousands of hate comments gathered under their mail. She begged and she was furious, and then all that was left on her account was the word \"deceased.\" The government maintains a zombie army of paid hate commentators. Not all trolls are part of it, but their culture feeds their hatred.\nThe leader of the nation and creator of the \"Dream of China\", Chairman Xi Jinping, has so far not visited Wuhan or any of the hospitals in the country where people suffering from the Coronavirus are treated. Instead, he gave a vague and prominent speech, signalling the will to fight, but also emphasising his government's \"stability and great vision\". Even the one on 27. In January, a late-deployed \"epidemic prevention team\" was not in front of Xi, but Prime Minister Li Keqiang. It was only after a meeting with the Director-General of the World Health Organisation that Xi took the lead.\nFor many Chinese, this is a time of \"Truth Overdemand\"\nYeah. It is impossible to list all that they have had to experience in recent weeks. But one thing is certain: the image of the Chinese Government as an embodiment of efficiency, unlimited resources and unquestionable authority, on which the government itself has been working for decades, is badly damaged. Meanwhile, some fear a total collapse of the Chinese economy due to the epidemic. However strong the resilience of the Chinese leadership may be, it is the first time in a long time that it has shown cracks. These could get bigger. For the basic capital of the government, however unfaithful it may have been acquired, is in danger: faced with the threat of a virus, many people now realize that propaganda is not a medical cure.\nGerman by Jakob Klagen\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "陆克文是一位中国记者和企业家。她在中国和德国工作。在这个时间在线系列中，她批判性地报道了中国的生活、文化和日常生活。为了保护自己的职业和私人环境，她用笔名写作。\n在他权力的巅峰时期，世界上最强大的独裁政权受到病毒的冲击。这个国家，即习近平领导下的中华人民共和国，即将成为量子计算机和人工智能发展的世界领头羊，拥有卓越的电信技术、世界上最快的火车、训练有素的官员和久负盛名的病毒研究。但所有这些都与新型冠状病毒无关。\n它的传播现在无情地暴露了这个系统的弱点。中国的官僚医疗体系显然没有准备好应对这种情况。过度拥挤的医院拒绝接受病人，最初保护不力的医生和护理人员甚至感染了冠状病毒。而这个问题早就应该提出来了，中国中央政府最近几周实际上更有效率：控制疾病的爆发，还是控制人口和信息的流动？\n在社交媒体时代，尤其是在中国，微信和微博是社交媒体的大平台，而不是Facebook和Twitter，现在很明显，用户在社交媒体上共享的信息只能通过审查来控制，因此只能有条件地删除。这些用户尤其来自20世纪80年代或之后的年轻一代，他们的成员从未经历过这样的混乱\n是 啊。这些年轻人是在中国历史上经济最幸福的几十年中成长起来的，他们尤其受益于父母所取得的日益增长的繁荣，这主要是由于全球化，中国作为一个生产地从中获得了前所未有的利益。这些中国年轻人到目前为止基本上信任共产党当局。他们对新冠状病毒构成的威胁缺乏反应，现在动摇了这种信念。\n在这场危机中，年轻人调动了前所未有的能量来帮助自己，他们也经常通过社交媒体组织起来。他们提供呼吸面罩并将其送往医院；他们为医务人员提供汽车；他们帮助被困在家中的老人和病人，并设法支持来自湖北的难民。民间社会正在作出巨大努力，以填补这一空白，即当局缺乏行动，显然过度依赖病毒的爆发。\n同时，社交媒体平台的存在也带来了一些截然不同的东西：正是由于这些平台，才有可能试图重建自中国出现新型冠状病毒以来发生的事件，因为这些事件基本上没有在官方媒体上报道过；还有人权观察的一份报告，30号。一月份，它支持这些搜索。这些都表明，至少在1月中旬之前，当局在地方和中央层面的行动是多么不充分，甚至是多么隐蔽。\n这种病毒的传播故事开始于一个半月前，与传言中的中国灾难一样多\n是 啊。去年12月底，在武汉1400万城市，当症状相同的患者到达医院时，医生将这些病例报告给当地的疾病护理中心，这是一个半身。根据社交媒体的帖子，他们的官员27日出现。去年12月在那里的医院里“非常不耐烦”，极不情愿地听取了医生们的担忧。\n三天后，30号。2019年12月，这个预防机构内部沟通，所有医院都应做好“不明肺病”的准备，医生“严禁”向公众提供信息。当局本身也没有通知公众。没有直接在发热和肺部疾病科室工作的医生对情况可能的严重性一无所知，因此在处理可能的科罗娜患者时没有受到保护。他们中的许多人后来经历了情况的严重性。\n当天下午和晚上，几位来自不同医院的医生在聊天组和微信上发布了对患者的诊断，并对防范机构的不作为表示了关注。他们警告同事，当地的鱼和猎物市场构成了危险，很快就被怀疑是疫情爆发。医生们还解释说，肺部疾病不断扩大的症状让人想起了Sars，这是一种传染性很强、威胁生命的传染病，2002年底、2003年初从华南地区蔓延开来。这一信息和政府内部的沟通传到了公众手中，截图从聊天中病毒般传播开来。在微博上，用户开始使用whansars这个标签。他们的帖子很快就从审查中删除了。\n31日上午\n是 啊。去年12月，武汉市卫生委员会（武汉市最高卫生行政部门）任命了一名发布新型冠状病毒信息的医生。他不得不透露他的消息来源。第二天，党委书记办公室要求医生为“谣言的传播”道歉，并保证从今以后不会泄露任何信息。然后他不得不接受警察的警告并签字。\n同一天，官方媒体代表首次来到世卫组织，对流传数天的“谣言”进行确认。迫于越来越大的压力，WMHC被迫发表公开声明；27例corona感染病例得到官方证实。之后，中国最高卫生当局，北京的国家卫生委员会，派出了一个专家组到武汉。最近有报道称，中国首都可能出现大规模传播疾病。\n与此同时，武汉鱼类和野生动物市场继续占据主导地位。一名记者采访了那些没有听说过这种病毒的经销商。野生动物被进一步出售。直到这篇报道出现在上海政府的第一个财经新闻页面上，市场才成为第一个。2020年1月关闭。\n当时已经有8人因“散布谣言”而被警方调查。新闻发言人在中央电视台等地方和中央政府频道以严厉的口吻宣布逮捕行动：“互联网不是一个自由的空间！”没有人透露被指控的罪犯散布了什么谣言。\n我有11个。最后，在一月份，医生最初住进了医院\n是 啊。诊断：肺炎。冠状病毒？甚至两个多星期后，医生仍然受到严重影响，他没有被告知自己身上的医学发现。许多受感染的病人也遭遇了同样的命运。至少在最初，已经证实中国有200多人感染了冠状病毒，其中许多人显然根本不知道自己的病情。\n长期以来，中国政府一直以新的模糊策略阻碍着对真相的探索。官员们只向公众公布了很少的信息和可疑的统计数字，其中还夹杂着对赢得“抗击瘟疫战争”决心的越来越愤怒的声明。\n一个明显掩盖的例子是，例如，武汉市政府3号。最多15个。一月份，没有新的感染病例报告，就好像病毒被魔法阻止了一样。有经验的观察家能够看穿这个咒语：恰好是湖北省人大在武汉召开的日子。这与2002/2003年非典危机爆发之初的博弈如出一辙：然而，当时北京政府几个月来一直坚决否认这一流行病，以期在春季北京全国代表大会前后“稳定”。17年过去了，没有真正的过去。\n专业杂志《柳叶刀》24日发表了一篇文章。一月二日追溯。今年1月，武汉市41名医院患者和患者提交了基于实验室的病毒感染报告，现在称为2019 nCoV\n是 啊。在这篇文章发表前五天，武汉市卫生局局长王广发曾告诉记者，这种新型冠状病毒“传染性不强”，人与人之间传播的风险“很低”。这种疾病可以“预防和控制”。王广发是从哪里得到消息的，他自己是否还不清楚，不能说。无论如何，在记者招待会后的两天，他自己也因为这种传染性不大的疾病而生病。\n而《人民日报》则在网上报道说，这些疾病的病因尚未确定，无论是非典还是更可能是一种危险性较小的疾病。但即使是saris，我们也有一套复杂的预防和控制系统。武汉人没有理由恐慌。”\n城里的居民很平静，继续他们的假期准备工作。在接下来的几周里，他们中的五百万人成群结队地和家人一起度过一月份的除夕夜。成千上万的人出国旅行。与此同时，社交媒体的帖子也不断出现，人们向北京、长沙、深圳、温州的亲戚或熟人报告了奇怪的疾病，并很快向日本和泰国报告。中国媒体停滞不前。没有人敢调查这些新案件。官方媒体语调松散，有关该病的简短报道突出了政府的能力，传播了乐观情绪。\n只有在香港，情况才很早就被认真对待。我有四个。1月份，报告了7例疑似病例。那里的政府立即采取了严格的预防措施，信息政策非常透明\n是 啊。相对独立的媒体在这方面发挥了重要作用。电视台昼夜不停地报道。记者和记者被派往中国大陆调查，但其中一些立即被警察赶出去或询问。\n已经七点了。今年1月，北京忠诚民主促进香港改善进步联盟主席李星斗随后前往中国首都，要求中央政府改善疫情信息流通。在网络媒体的相关报道中，政府巨魔和爱国者随后来到他们面前：“那你就不能示威了！你们香港人在污染环境！”\n湖北省和武汉市政府在没有什么可隐瞒和美化的时候，继续举办各种庆祝除夕的晚会和活动，直到18日。今年1月，该市组织了4万户家庭一起做饭、吃饭的盛宴。与会者显然相信官方的口号：相信政府！似乎没有人意识到冠状病毒也可以在这里庆祝盛宴。\n我得了19分。今年1月，官方媒体突然与大谭一起宣布，一位现年84岁的英雄在2003年抗击非典的战斗中复出：出人意料的是，肺科专家、中华医学会原会长钟南山被召去参加一场医学宣传战。他设法挤进了广州南部一条快车道的餐车里。在武汉，他被写下，并立即在第二天继续到北京向卫生局报告。上午20点\n是 啊。今年1月，他向记者坦言，病毒有可能在人与人之间传播，当时已有14名医务人员代表受到感染。在这次出色的面试之后，他转入了地下。\n直到现在，媒体才决定忽略政府似乎存在的枪口。剩下的少数传统媒体的勇敢记者和记者前往武汉实地调查。许多网络谣言得到证实：医院实际上超载，不得不拒绝众多病人，医生和护士生病，官员撒谎和隐瞒，显然没有足够的测试包来测试所有病人的病毒。\n官方消息称，医院至少提供了10万个这样的测试包，病人有4000张床位，而确诊感染和疑似病例的数量仍有三倍。\n是 啊。但是那些测试包和病床呢？面具、手套和防护服的“足够数量”在哪里？如何解释来自中国各地知名医院的求情电话？\n那些在社交媒体上渴望得到父母、祖父母和自己治疗的孩子们的心碎呼吁呢？在网上视频中，在医院最前面的街道上翻滚排队的人是谁？那个白费力气，一个接一个地想在家里接受祖母遗体的年轻女人呢？那医生怎么办？他崩溃了，喊道：“把那些躺在走廊里的人赶走！立即！”在社交媒体上疯传护士午休时歇斯底里哭泣的视频？\n另一方面，政府机构显然有时间和金钱：据说世界上最好的电信技术已被用于监测湖北省的所有移动用户，并向其他省份报告来自濒危地区的游客数量。一些地方当局还报告了他们的姓名、地址和身份证号码。来自湖北的旅客在旅馆被拒绝。据报道，一些人在公路上被误导，受到侮辱甚至殴打。当地政府为那些不受欢迎的难民准备了住处，但后来没有告诉人们哪里可以找到住处。\n到目前为止，人们已经认识到“与病毒作斗争”的逻辑（或不合逻辑）：在医院里，即使住院的病人显然也只检测了部分病毒\n是 啊。最初由于巨大的遏制措施（例如在武汉）而显得相对较少的确诊感染人数（目前在中国正式超过17000人）至少可以部分地解释这一点，也可以解释为很明显，很多病人被拒绝接受治疗。从中国传给冠状病毒的数据和统计数据无论如何都只能被保留地相信。\n在中国网络中，病人和他们的亲属在社交媒体上发言时，现在正受到巨魔的骚扰。他们指责病人是模拟器或敌方特工，要求证明他们的困境，然后诋毁证据。一个例子是一个年轻的妇女，像她的父亲和祖母一样，被医院感染和拒绝。她向一个女人求助。成千上万的仇恨评论聚集在他们的邮件下。她乞求着，怒不可遏，然后她只剩下了一个词“死亡”政府维持着一支由付费仇恨评论员组成的僵尸军队。并非所有的巨魔都是其中的一部分，但他们的文化助长了他们的仇恨。\n国家领导人、“中国梦”的缔造者、国家主席习近平到目前为止还没有去过武汉，也没有去过全国治疗冠状病毒感染者的医院。相反，他发表了一个模糊而突出的讲话，表明了战斗的意愿，但也强调了他的政府的“稳定和伟大的愿景”。即使是27号的那个。今年1月，一支部署较晚的“防疫队”并没有出现在习近平面前，而是总理李克强。习近平是在与世界卫生组织总干事会晤后才率先采取行动的。\n对许多中国人来说，这是一个“真理要求过高”的时代\n是 啊。不可能列出他们最近几周所经历的一切。但有一点是肯定的：中国政府作为效率、无限资源和毋庸置疑的权威的化身的形象，政府本身几十年来一直致力于此，现在已经严重受损。与此同时，一些人担心中国经济会因为这种流行病而彻底崩溃。不管中国领导层的弹性有多强，这是很长时间以来第一次出现裂痕。这些可能会变大。因为政府的基本资本，不管它有多么不忠，都处于危险之中：面对病毒的威胁，许多人现在意识到，宣传不是一种医疗方法。\n德文作者：Jakob Klagen\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The new Coronavirus from China has now also arrived in Germany. The Bavarian health authorities confirmed the first four cases in the Federal Republic on Tuesday.\nAt first the new lung disease had been detected in a 33-year-old man from Landsberg am Lech district. He was infected in his company in a suburb of Munich with a colleague from China. On Tuesday evening, the Bavarian Ministry of Health announced that three more people were infected with the new Coronavirus. \"These patients are also employees of Starnberg County,\" he continued.\nThe four persons concerned were admitted stationary at the Munich clinic Schwabing, where they were medically monitored and isolated, as the Ministry reported. \"Some other contact persons are currently being tested for an infection with the Coronavirus as well.\" Bayern's Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) said, \"The company's total number of 40 employees who are eligible as close contacts has been identified. The people concerned should be tested on Wednesday as a precautionary measure.\"Then the Ministry also wants to inform the press about the current situation.\nAccording to information from the Bavarian National Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL), the 33-year-old had contracted an infection with a colleague from China who had received training last week on the Webasto car supplier in the Gautinger district of Stockdorf in the Upper Bavarian district of Starnberg. The woman didn't have her infection until 23rd. January on the return flight to China.\nThe new Coronavirus 2019-nCoV can cause a lung disease in which more than 100 people have already died in the main country of China, most of which were elderly patients with severe pre-existing diseases.\nYeah. The total number of known diseases worldwide has now increased to more than 4500, with at least 106 people dying of lung disease in China.\nThe first Coronavirus patient had tested positive for the virus on Monday and had gone back to work. \"He is quite well, he was still working yesterday morning,\" LGL President Andreas Zapf said. \"He is fever-free and has no respiratory symptoms at the moment,\" added Chief Medical Officer Clemens Wendtner of Schwabing Clinic. The man is in an isolation room, there was no danger to other patients.\nAccording to LGL data, the people who had contact with the Chinese and the first sick German Webasto employee are under observation and are urged not to leave their home. According to the Ministry of Health, his child goes to a crib in Landsberg am Lech district. This too is now under observation, LGL President Zapf said. The family status of the three other patients was not known at first. The head of the Infectiology Task Force, Martin Hoch, stressed: \"The number can still rise.\"\nThe new virus 2019-nCoV was originally believed to originate from a market in the Chinese millionaire city of Wuhan, where wild animals traded there probably jumped to humans. According to current experts, the new type of lung disease appears to be mild in most cases, possibly even without symptoms.\nTransmission before the first symptoms are considered very rare. Thus, the first confirmed case of Coronavirus in Germany may also provide new insights into the pathways of infection of lung disease. Because the man was infected with the Chinese woman after initial knowledge, although at the time she showed no symptoms of the disease.\nThe authorities now want to gradually introduce further measures in Bavaria\nYeah. An official hotline of the Bavarian authorities was established, and some health insurance companies did so. Passengers at Munich Airport are required to see a doctor if they suspect an infection with the new Coronavirus, according to the information provided by the National Office with posters in three languages. Further escalation stages of the alert plan are possible: Currently, together with the federation, it is being discussed \"whether it might be useful to measure fever at airports,\" said Minister Huml. In view of the Coronavirus outbreak this year, the world's largest toy fair in Nuremberg is expecting fewer visitors from China.\nThere is no reason to panic, said Huml, as well as her colleague, Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU). The case shows \"that we are well prepared,\" he said. The risk to human health in Germany remains low, according to the Robert Koch Institute.\nDespite this, respiratory masks were sold out in individual pharmacies in Bavaria. He has heard this from companies in Lower Franconia and Munich, a spokesman for the Bavarian Pharmaceutical Association of the German Press Agency said.\nThe management of Webasto has cleared the staff at Stockdorfer Central for this week whether they want to come to the office or rather work at home. Webasto is a major supplier for the automotive industry with 13,400 employees and a turnover of 3,4 billion euro. The company had previously cancelled all business trips to China for the next two weeks. BMW, Audi and Siemens also stated that only strictly necessary business trips to China will take place.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "来自中国的新型冠状病毒目前也已抵达德国。巴伐利亚州卫生当局周二证实了联邦共和国的前四例病例。\n起初，在兰兹贝格-阿姆-莱赫区的一名33岁男子身上发现了新的肺病。他与一位来自中国的同事在慕尼黑郊区的公司感染了病毒。星期二晚上，巴伐利亚州卫生部宣布又有三人感染了这种新型冠状病毒。“这些病人也是斯坦伯格县的雇员，”他继续说。\n据德国卫生部报道，这4名涉案人员在慕尼黑施瓦宾诊所（Munich clinic Schwabing）被收治时是静止不动的，他们在那里接受了医学监测和隔离。拜仁卫生部长梅兰妮·休姆（Melanie Huml）说：“目前，其他一些接触者也在接受冠状病毒感染检测，拜仁共有40名员工符合密切接触的条件。作为预防措施，有关人员应该在周三接受检测。”然后，卫生部还想向新闻界通报目前的情况。\n根据来自巴伐利亚州国家卫生和食品安全办公室（LGL）的信息，这位33岁的年轻人与一位中国同事感染了病毒，他上周在斯塔恩伯格上巴伐利亚州斯托克多夫的高廷格区接受了Webasto汽车供应商的培训。这名妇女直到23日才感染。一月份返回中国的航班。\n2019年新型冠状病毒nCoV可导致中国主要国家已有100多人死亡的肺病，其中大部分是患有严重既往疾病的老年患者。\n是 啊。目前，全球已知疾病总数已增至4500多种，中国至少有106人死于肺病。\n第一个冠状病毒病人在星期一检测出病毒阳性，现在已经回去工作了。LGL总裁扎普夫（Andreas Zapf）说：“他很好，昨天早上还在工作。”。施瓦宾诊所的首席医疗官克莱门斯·温特纳补充说：“他目前没有发烧，也没有呼吸系统症状。”。这个人在隔离室里，对其他病人没有危险。\n根据LGL的数据，与中国人和第一个生病的德国Webasto员工有过接触的人正在接受观察，并被敦促不要离开他们的家。根据卫生部的说法，他的孩子去了兰茨贝格阿姆莱赫区的一个婴儿床。LGL总裁扎普夫说，这也在观察之中。其他三名患者的家庭状况一开始并不清楚。传染病专责小组的负责人马丁霍克强调说：“这个数字还会上升。”\n2019年新病毒nCoV最初被认为来自中国百万富翁城市武汉的一个市场，那里交易的野生动物可能跳到了人类身上。据目前的专家称，这种新型肺病在大多数情况下似乎是轻微的，甚至可能没有症状。\n在第一症状出现之前传播被认为是非常罕见的。因此，德国首例冠状病毒确诊病例也可能为肺部疾病的感染途径提供新的见解。因为这名男子是在初步了解中国女子感染后，虽然当时她没有出现疾病症状。\n当局现在希望在巴伐利亚逐步采取进一步措施\n是 啊。巴伐利亚当局开通了官方热线，一些健康保险公司也开通了热线。根据国家办公室提供的信息，慕尼黑机场的乘客如果怀疑感染了新的冠状病毒，必须去看医生。预警计划的进一步升级阶段是可能的：目前，正在与联邦一起讨论“在机场测量发烧是否有用”，休姆部长说。鉴于今年冠状病毒的爆发，纽伦堡世界最大的玩具展预计来自中国的游客将减少。\n休姆和她的同事、联邦卫生部长延斯•斯潘（Jens Spahn）说，没有理由恐慌。他说，这起案件表明“我们准备充分”。据罗伯特·科赫研究所称，德国的人类健康风险仍然很低。\n尽管如此，巴伐利亚州的个别药店的呼吸面罩还是卖光了。德国新闻机构巴伐利亚制药协会的发言人说，他已经从下弗朗索尼亚和慕尼黑的公司那里听到了这一消息。\n本周，Webasto的管理层已经让Stockdorfer Central的员工清楚了，他们是来办公室还是在家工作。伟巴斯特是汽车行业的主要供应商，拥有13400名员工和34亿欧元的营业额。此前，该公司已取消了未来两周所有赴中国的商务旅行。宝马、奥迪和西门子也表示，只会进行严格必要的中国商务旅行。（dpa）\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "From afar, it may look like everything is back to normal. \"But nothing is normal anymore,\" he says. Not at all. The protests in Hong Kong, with pictures of burning barricades and beating up police officers around the world in the last six months, have become quieter and rarer. They're not gone, they just moved. Kelvin better not mention his real name. It's late January, the last night of the Chinese New Year's Eve, the 22-year-old is on his way to visit relatives.\nThe telephone connection is scratchy, \"I'm on the subway,\" says Kelvin bluntly as if through cotton wool. He's wearing a mask again. But not a heavy one, against tear gas fog, but a light one, against the Coronavirus, which found its way to Hong Kong. The day before, the head of government, Carrie Lam, declared a state of emergency. The local Disneyland closes, photos show public places empty and abandoned, demonstrations will not take place for the time being. However, companies threaten to strike doctors and nurses for Monday, if the government does not agree to seal Hong Kong off completely for visitors from mainland China.\nEnd of New Year holidays\nIn fact, after the end of the New Year's holidays, the students of the city should have returned to school on Monday. On Friday, however, Lam announced that the schools would remain closed due to the risk of infection until March. \"The city is in panic,\" says Kelvin. Nothing is normal anymore. But that's not what he wants right now.\n2020 everything will be different, Hong Kong Managing Director Matthew Cheung had promised in December. Kelvin laughs bitterly. He hasn't had faith in politics in a long time. Kelvin says he went to the last demonstration about once a week. And of course there are always violent scenes, the police continue to act violently\nYeah. But the real protest no longer takes place on the streets, but on the economic level. In recent months, something that demonstrators have called yellow economy has developed, yellow economy.\nIn an ever-growing kind of online registry, shops, restaurants, even fitness studios are referred to as either yellow or blue. Yellow means democracy-friendly. Blue: Beijing friendly. \"I'm strict,\" says Kelvin, \"I don't spend a penny on those who face the protests in cold blood.\" It is the collateral damage of a revolution that ordinary employees can also be affected, whose contracts are terminated. That's what they say happened.\nImportant financial and commercial space\nThere's no way to verify that in detail. But it seems clear that Hong Kong's economy, which is an important financial and trading place for China, has suffered under the protests. Governor Carrie Lam is constantly warning of bad numbers. But if this should frighten the demonstrators, it will not work. If economic pressure on the Beijing Government does not work, what then? Kelvin says, \"How you spend your money is like voting in an election.\" At the same time, it is a low-threshold form of protest. Anyone can participate without putting themselves in danger. Consumption has long become political. It fits with this protest movement that the next dynamic strategy developed from the depths of its creative mass.\n\"Be Water, My Friend\", a six-month quote by Bruce Lee had been the motto of the Hong Kong demonstrators. At the beginning of June 2019, hundreds of thousands had taken to the streets for the first time to protest against a change in the law that would allow the extradition of suspects and criminals to China without difficulty\nYeah. Kelvin was there for the first time as a Hong Kong policeman, who was massively against demonstrators, on the 12th. June! It was an earlier turning point after which the first peaceful protest changed radically. Both sides were equipped: the police with even more tear gas, rubber bullets, water jets and clubs; the mostly young demonstrators with Molotov cocktails and professional equipment. Streets became battlefields, weekly.\nHard judgments\nKelvin works at a law firm during the week. As an assistant, he handles cases of young demonstrators to be convicted of possession of weapons. For hours, he watches CCTV footage to be able to tell exactly what happened when, as in an altercation with the police. He says he's happy to be able to do this job, even if it's not always fair. Because some judges speeded up proceedings in order to quickly condemn people; because many, in doubt, always opted for the harsher verdict. \"Last week,\" he says, \"a 23-year-old girl was sentenced to twelve months in prison for helping a demonstrator wear Molotov cocktails.\"\nReuters News Agency recently wrote about 7000-year-old people who were arrested during the seven-month protests. According to police chief Chris Tang, 1092 had been convicted. Most of the nine. June to 14th. November 2019 prisoners were reported to be between 21 and 25 years old, most of them male. Half a year of protests have divided the city into supporters and opponents of Beijing, but have also torn families apart. The conflict is also one between generations, the youth thinking yellow, the grandparents blue.\nFear of persecution\nThis is the case, for example, with 23-year-old Dawn. Nor does she mention her real name out of fear of persecution\nYeah. For months, it has been avoiding confrontation with relatives loyal to the Chinese state. Like your over-80-year-old grandfather. Only relatives from the mainland managed to convince him of his travel plans for the New Year's Eve. Until then, he believed the Communist Party had control of the Coronavirus outbreak. She also visited her family for New Year's. Because the relatives ordered the food from a blue restaurant, they also ordered it from a yellow restaurant. The disgust remained because, exceptionally, everyone talked about the Coronavirus and not about politics. She regularly sends parents lists of \"permitted\" shops. Sometimes, she says, they stuck to it. For her, as for Kelvin, that's not a question. \"I got used to looking before entering a store.\" She says, laughing at the snakes at the door, even without an app.\nBy Whatsapp, Dawn sends links to the apps she uses. The city maps are covered with yellow, blue and some red dots. Attention: mainland Chinese capital! A McDonald's in the Pok Fu Lam district is marked blue, a window with explanations opens after a click. Including those on 25th. In August 2019 vouchers were issued to police officers. Meat Pie Gor restaurant in Tai Wai is yellow. The owners have sided with the demonstrators. Or Sogno Gelato, the famous ice cream shop in a shopping mall in Tsuen Wan, which does not serve policemen; who, as a form of protest at the end of the year, sold his own creation, flavor direction tear gas, with black pepper.\nOn the Lennon Wall\nThe standards by which the shops are evaluated are constantly discussed in Hong Kong\nYeah. Has the owner spoken out in favour of government? Are the entrepreneurs demonstrably pro-Beijing? It hasn't been so easy to be part of a revolution for a long time if it just means buying the coffee in the right cafe. Dawn tells of people who were beaten up by policemen when they glued colorful post-its with wishes and demands to the so-called Lennon Walls, which were built all over Hong Kong on buildings, suburbs and business facades. Already 2014, during the umbrella movement there had been. Her example is in Prague, where a wall has been painted with graffiti and spelling since the 1960s as an expression of protest against the communist regime. \"We do not know what can happen to us if we express our opinion publicly,\" says Dawn. \"In the yellow economy we can feel free and safe.\"\nDawn worked as a social worker until mid-January. Night after night, she was on her way to homeless teens, runaways and drug addicts. The more intense the protests became, the more frequently they and their team with Minivan also served as revolutionary tactics. They quickly brought the young protesters out of the danger zone or home, when at some point at 22am no longer a subway was running. What she experienced and saw did not leave her untouched. She had a panic attack and couldn't sleep. She still has stomach problems today. Dawn's work was not without risk; at the wedding of the protests, the Hong Kong police also arrested first-aid workers and social workers.\nHoliday in Australia\nBefore looking for a new job, she will travel: two weeks Australia in February. She'll be accompanying friends, nurses who see her vacation as a research trip. They want to find out if they can imagine a life in Australia. A little Dawn wants that, too.\nYeah. \"Quite honestly,\" she says, \"I do not want to have children here, because I could not guarantee them a good life, no democracy, no freedom and no possibility of doing what they want.\" \"Rationally, we believe that emigration is the best thing for us. We just can't do it emotionally.\"\nFor Kelvin, emigration is also a realistic option. On the weekends he now learns again for his studies in order to have the best possible opportunities in another country with an early graduation. His parents, who think \"yellow\" like him, consider moving to Taiwan.

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON (BLOOMBERG) - The coronavirus may have infected at least 1 in 20 people in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicentre of the global outbreak, by the time it peaks in coming weeks, according to scientists modelling its spread. \n The typically bustling megacity, where the so-called 2019-nCoV virus emerged late last year, has been in lockdown since Jan 23, restricting the movement of 11 million people. \n Trends in reported cases in Wuhan so far broadly support the mathematical modelling the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is using to predict the epidemic's transmission dynamics. \n \"Assuming current trends continue, we're still projecting a mid-to-late-February peak\" in Wuhan, said Associate Professor Adam Kucharski, an infectious disease epidemiology expert in an email Sunday (Feb 9). \n \"There's a lot of uncertainty, so I'm cautious about picking out a single value for the peak, but it's possible based on current data we might see a peak prevalence over 5 per cent.\" \n Health authorities in China and around the world are anxiously waiting to know whether the world's largest known quarantine has been effective in containing the pneumonia-causing virus in Wuhan and across other cities in Hubei province, the landlocked region of 60 million people. \n Assoc Prof Kucharski, whose research focuses on the dynamics of infectious diseases, and colleagues have based their modelling on a range of assumptions about the virus. These include an incubation of 5.2 days, a delay from the onset of symptoms to confirmation of infection of 6.1 days, and the risk of infection among the 10 million people who have been identified as more vulnerable in Wuhan. \n Based on that, a prevalence of 5 per cent equates to about 500,000 cumulative infections. That's many times more than the 14,982 cases provincial health authorities had counted in Wuhan as of 8pm Saturday\n. \n Researchers will gauge the proportion of people in the population who have been infected with virus after a test becomes available enabling them to conduct a so-called serosurvey to identify those whose blood contains antibodies produced in response to exposure to the virus. \n Currently, the true number of people in Wuhan exposed to the virus \"may be vastly underestimated,\" Dr Manuel Battegay and colleagues at the University of Basel in Switzerland said in a study published Friday. \n \"With a focus on thousands of serious cases, mild or asymptomatic courses that possibly account for the bulk of the 2019-nCoV infections might remain largely unrecognised, in particular during the influenza season.\" \n Authorities in China have counted more than 37,000 cases - of which more than 800 have been fatal - over the past two months. That has surpassed the 774 fatalities from the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or Sars, over eight months, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). \n In the first 17,000 or so cases, about 82 per cent are mild, 15 per cent severe and 3 per cent critical, the WHO said Friday. Of 138 patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in the first four weeks of January, 26 per cent were placed in intensive care and 4.3 per cent died, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association published Friday found. \n While the fast-moving, infectious coronavirus has caused thousands of people to fall gravely ill and overwhelm hospitals, once researchers understand the full spectrum of illness associated with the virus, the overall case-fatality risk is likely to be much less than 1 per cent, said Dr Ian Lipkin, director of the Centre for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York. \n People with mild or no apparent symptoms aren't currently being counted among cases, he told reporters Sunday\n. A slowdown in the increase in reported cases over the past few days is \"meaningful,\" according to Dr Lipkin, who recently returned to the US from China, where he was advising on the outbreak. He spoke with journalists during a 14-day home quarantine. \n If measures taken so far to contain the outbreak are effective, some \"dramatic reductions\" in infections should be observed in the third or fourth weeks of February, he said. Warmer, early-spring weather might also impede transmission, he said. \n Some studies indicate an infected person may not display symptoms for 14 days or more, with testing and confirmation of cases adding to delays. This will prolong the time it will take to identify whether China's unprecedented disease-control measures have worked. \n \"The next two weeks are really critical to understand what's been happening,\" said Dr Benjamin Cowling, head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong, in an interview in Melbourne on Thursday. \n \"And, is this going to spread into other locations, or have we avoided what could be a global pandemic because of the control measures that have been implemented to date?\" \n The number of cases reported in Wuhan and across Hubei province has been tracking downward over the past several days. \n \"There has been a stabilisation in the number of cases reported from Hubei, and we're in a four-day stable period where the number of reported cases hasn't advanced,\" Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, told reporters in Geneva Saturday. \n \"That's good news and may reflect the impact of the control measures that have been put in place.\" \n There has been a \"low, but steady incidence\" of infections in places outside Hubei, Dr Ryan said. It's unclear which of those provinces may control the disease or where it might escalate, he said. \n \"We hope that the same stabilisation that appears to be occurring in Wuhan also occurs outside,\" Dr Ryan said\n. \"But, again it's very, very, very early to make any predictions about numbers.\" \"This is still a very intense disease outbreak in Wuhan and Hubei, and there are still great risks in practically all of the other provinces, so we will wait and see,\" he said.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "伦敦（彭博社）-根据模拟冠状病毒传播的科学家，冠状病毒在未来几周达到高峰时，可能已经在全球爆发中心的中国城市武汉感染了至少1/20的人。\n这座通常熙熙攘攘的特大城市，即所谓的2019年nCoV病毒去年底出现的地方，自1月23日以来一直处于封锁状态，限制了1100万人的流动。\n到目前为止，武汉报告病例的趋势广泛支持伦敦卫生与热带医学院用来预测流行病传播动态的数学模型。\n传染病流行病学专家亚当·库查尔斯基副教授周日（2月9日）在一封电子邮件中说：“假设目前的趋势继续下去，我们仍预计武汉将出现2月中下旬的高峰。”。\n“有很多不确定性，所以我对挑选峰值的单个值持谨慎态度，但根据目前的数据，我们可能会看到峰值患病率超过5%。”\n中国和世界各地的卫生当局正焦急地等待着世界上最大的已知检疫是否有效遏制了武汉和湖北省其他城市的肺炎病毒，这是6000万人的内陆地区。\n库查尔斯基教授，他的研究重点是传染病的动力学，和他的同事们建立在一系列关于病毒的假设的基础上。其中包括潜伏期为5.2天，从症状出现到确诊感染的时间推迟了6.1天，以及在武汉被确定为更易感染的1000万人中的感染风险。\n在此基础上，5%的流行率相当于约50万例累积感染。这比上周六晚上8点武汉市省级卫生部门统计的14982例病例多了很多倍\n.\n研究人员将在检测结果出来后，对感染病毒的人群中的比例进行评估，使他们能够进行所谓的血清调查，以确定血液中含有因接触病毒而产生的抗体的人群。\n瑞士巴塞尔大学的Manuel Battegay博士和他的同事在周五发表的一项研究中说，目前，武汉真正接触病毒的人数“可能被大大低估”。\n“随着对数千例严重病例的关注，可能占2019年nCoV感染主要部分的轻度或无症状病程可能在很大程度上仍未被发现，特别是在流感季节。”\n在过去的两个月里，中国当局统计了37000多起病例，其中800多起是致命的。根据世界卫生组织（WHO）的数据，这已经超过了2002-2003年8个月内爆发的严重急性呼吸系统综合症（Sars）的774例死亡人数。\n世卫组织星期五说，在最初的1.7万例左右的病例中，大约82%是轻度的，15%是重度的，3%是严重的。上周五出版的《美国医学会杂志》（Journal Of the American Medical Association）的一项研究发现，1月前4周，武汉大学中南医院收治的138名患者中，26%接受了重症监护，4.3%死亡。\n感染与免疫中心主任伊恩·利普金博士说，尽管这种快速传播的传染性冠状病毒已导致数千人重病，使医院不堪重负，但一旦研究人员了解了与病毒相关的全部疾病谱，总的病死率可能远低于1%在纽约哥伦比亚大学邮差公共卫生学院。\n他星期天对记者说，目前还没有把症状轻微或没有明显症状的人列入病例\n. 据利普金博士说，过去几天报告病例增长放缓是“有意义的”，他最近从中国返回美国，为疫情提供咨询。在为期14天的家庭隔离期间，他接受了记者采访。\n他说，如果迄今为止采取的控制疫情的措施是有效的，那么应该在2月的第三或第四周观察到感染人数的“大幅减少”。他说，温暖的早春天气也可能阻碍传播。\n一些研究表明，感染者可能在14天或更长时间内不会出现症状，对病例的检测和确认会增加延误。这将延长鉴定中国前所未有的疾病控制措施是否奏效所需的时间。\n香港大学的流行病学和生物统计学负责人Benjamin Cowling博士星期四在墨尔本接受采访时说：“接下来的两周对了解正在发生的事情至关重要。”\n“而且，这是否会蔓延到其他地区，或者我们是否已经避免了由于迄今已实施的控制措施而可能导致的全球流行病？”\n过去几天，武汉和湖北省各地报告的病例数一直在下降。\n世卫组织卫生紧急情况方案执行主任迈克·瑞安博士星期六在日内瓦对记者说：“湖北报告的病例数量已经稳定下来，我们正处于一个4天稳定期，报告的病例数量没有进展。”。\n“这是个好消息，可能反映出已经出台的控制措施的影响。”\n瑞安博士说，湖北以外地区的感染率“低，但稳定”。他说，目前还不清楚这些省份中的哪一个可能控制了这种疾病，或者在哪里可能会升级。\n瑞安博士说：“我们希望武汉出现的同样的稳定也发生在外部。”\n. \"但是，现在对数字做出任何预测都非常、非常、非常早。“武汉和湖北的疫情仍然非常严重，而且几乎所有其他省份都存在很大的风险，所以我们将拭目以待，”他说。\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SHANGHAI/BEIJING (REUTERS) – The United States angered China on Friday (Jan 31) with a warning to Americans not to travel there because of a coronavirus epidemic that has rattled the global economy with increasing disruption to business supply lines. \n Originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the flu-like virus first identified earlier this month has resulted in 213 deaths in China. Wuhan and the surrounding region are in virtual quarantine. \n More than 9,800 people have been infected in China and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions, with Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reporting their first cases on Thursday or Friday. \n “Do not travel to China due to the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan,” the US State Department said, raising the warning for China to the same level as Afghanistan and Iraq. \n Beijing, which has only just started to mend tattered trade ties with Washington, responded sharply. \n It noted the World Health Organisation (WHO) has commended Chinese containment efforts and not recommended travel or trade curbs. \n “The World Health Organisation urged countries to avoid travel restrictions, but very soon after that, the United States did the opposite,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. “It’s truly mean.” \n Many other countries have also advised citizens to put off non-urgent travel to China. After reporting its first two cases of the illness, Russia on Friday restricted direct flights to China, its biggest trade partner. \n Panama’s canal authority said vessels that had passed through countries where coronavirus had been confirmed had to report that to authorities. \n Singapore, a major travel hub in Asia, stopped entry of passengers with a recent history of travel to China and also suspended visas for Chinese passport holders\n. \n With major fallout inevitable for China’s economy, which is the world’s second largest, global shares were heading for their biggest weekly losses since August on Friday. \n The outbreak could “reverberate globally”, Moody’s said. \n In the latest impact to big name corporations, South Korea’s Hyundai Motor said it planned to halt production of a sport utility vehicle this weekend due to a supply disruption caused by the outbreak. \nSangyong Motor said it would idle its plant in the South Korean city of Pyeongtaek from Feb 4-12 for the same reason. \n Home appliance maker Electrolux issued a similar warning. \n French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen said its three plants in Wuhan will remain closed until mid-February. \n After holding off as the crisis grew, the WHO said on Thursday that the epidemic did constitute a public health emergency of international concern, a designation that triggers tighter global containment measures and coordination. \n However, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reiterated in a series of tweets on Friday that his organisation had confidence in China’s capacity to control the 2019-nCoV virus. \n “We would’ve seen many more #2019nCoV cases outside China by now, and probably deaths, if it were not for the government’s efforts and the progress they’ve made to protect their own people and the world,” he tweeted. \n “Travel restrictions can cause more harm than good by hindering info-sharing and medical supply chains and harming economies. We urge countries and companies to make evidence-based, consistent decisions.” \n The roughly 60 million residents of Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital, have had movements curbed to try and slow the spread of the disease. But some people were leaving and entering the area by foot on a bridge over the Yangtze river, a Reuters witness said, and infections have jumped in two cities flanking Wuhan. \n Wuhan’s Communist Party chief said the city should have acted earlier to contain the virus\n. \n China’s statistics show just over 2per cent of infected people have died, suggesting the virus is less deadly than the 2002-2003 outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). \n But economists say its financial impact could be bigger than Sars, which killed about 800 people at an estimated cost of US$33 billion (S$50 billion) to the global economy, since China’s share of the world economy is now far greater. \n The WHO has reported at least eight cases of human-to-human transmission – as opposed to people coming infected from China - in four countries: the United States, Germany, Japan and Vietnam. Thailand said it too had such a case. \n Rising public alarm over the epidemic has brought a wave of anti-China sentiment abroad and led airlines to cancel or reduce flights, with airline crews pressuring carriers to act. \n US carriers Delta Air Lines and American Airlines became the latest major airlines to suspend flights after the US travel advisory. \n Governments around the world are evacuating citizens from Hubei. \n A plane with 83 British and 27 foreign nationals landed in Britain on Friday, while the United States issued a quarantine order for 195 Americans evacuated to California this week. Japan, with 14 confirmed cases, has sent three flights to bring citizens home.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The citizens, 18 Portuguese and two Brazilian citizens, who arrived in Portugal on Sunday evening repatriated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak of the new coronavirus that has already infected more than 17 thousand people and killed more than 300, are well and without signs of respiratory disease. The Directorate-General for Health is still assessing when they can be repeated for analysis.\nThe 20 citizens are distributed by Pulido Valente Hospital and Health Park (four returnees are at this facility) in Lisbon, and were visited earlier this Monday afternoon by the International Sanity Team, coordinated by the Directorate-General for Health (DGS). W\n\"There is currently no clinical evidence to report. Last night's atmosphere was quite tranquil after a long journey. From the standpoint of the general state, they're all fine. We are also making sure that aspects of comfort are improved. We know the facility isn't a hotel. There are aspects that are being completed, such as some supporting material such as books, newspapers and the Internet,\"said the Health Minister at a press conference this Monday.\nHealth Director Grace Freitas supplemented clinical information: \"None of the people have developed symptoms related to the new disease. There has been no fever, cough or respiratory symptoms.\" 20 citizens can live together as long as they wear masks and comply with the recommendations made by health professionals.\nFor the time being, the analyses carried out at the end of Sunday night, the results of which were known this Monday, were negative for the presence of the new coronavirus. But they can be repeated, although the moment at which this may happen is still under consideration.\nThe first action, she said, will be symptom observation. \"The appearance of symptoms will cause repeat analysis\nYeah. All countries are learning from this new methodology. The virus was detected less than a month ago. There are countries that are conducting analyses at 48-hour and 72-hour intervals, some with symptoms and others only when quarantine is over. We are looking at the various hypotheses almost every day and will take a decision on the basis of what we think is best and what the other partner countries are doing,\"he explained.\nGrace Freitas also said that the DGS is counting on the cooperation of a group of experts and that it will be on the basis of the recommendation of this group that they will also take a decision on when to repeat the analyses. \"We have not yet made a decision. Tomorrow [Tuesday] we will speak to the experts again and, according to the experts, we will decide the frequency of the analyses.\"\nShould one of these people show any suspicious symptoms, the protocol that already exists will be triggered. The professional contacts the medical support line for validation of the case as a suspect, there will be collection of material for analysis and the person will be referred to the reference hospital. In the face of a positive case, if close contact has taken place with another of the masked returnees, it will be necessary to resume the quarantine cycle.\nQuestioned again on the issue of isolation and measures to be applied to other citizens from China, Mrs Marta Temido reminded us that legislation allows, in exceptional situations that do not occur, separation of persons in order to ensure the health of themselves and third parties.\n\"These are exceptional measures that are always dependent on some consideration, proportionality criteria and legislation; this is not the case, but we know that there are mechanisms that we have and will use if necessary to ensure that they are themselves placed in security situations, as well as the general community,\" explained the minister\nYeah.\nGrace Freitas once again stressed that this group of citizens is special because it has been at least thirty days at the epicentre of a new disease and has therefore been treated with special measures. \"These citizens are not the same as others who may come from China. That's why the Ministry of Health decided to treat them in a special way. Others who arrive at similar risk will receive similar treatment. For different risk, different treatment\", the Director-General for Health pointed out.\nPortugal currently has three reference hospitals for suspected cases of infection with the new coronavirus and two specialised ambulances for the displacement of these cases. The delay in moving a suspect case to St John's Hospital on Felgueiras led the Union of Emergency Technicians Pre-Hospitality to make several criticisms about the material made available in the ambulances, the means available elsewhere in the country and the information available.\nGrace Freitas explained that in this first phase, whose level is of disease containment, it is necessary to have a \"very restricted first-line service line, with a well-prepared laboratory and a very capable number of professionals\". At this time he said that they were working with the National Institute of Health Dr. Ricardo Jorge (Insa) and the Regional Health Administrations already thinking of a second line of response with more laboratories, transport network and other hospitals involved.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nQuestioned as to the protocol at this time if a suspicious case appears, e.g. in the Azores or Madeira, the person responsible has indicated that the patient will be set to leave in a hospital unit in the autonomous region and if there is no laboratory capacity in the area, will be the biological sample to be sent to Lisbon for testing in the reference laboratory\nYeah. Insa President Fernando Almeida stressed that the institute works in network with other 20 national laboratories, including in the islands, and that everyone has the technology to carry out the tests.\nMarta Temido added that an assessment is ongoing of what happened with the two suspicious cases that Portugal has already registered, one in Lisbon and one in Porto. \"We already have all the time line collection and we will do a detailed internal analysis to see what went less well and evaluate measures to be taken.\"\nThe Minister added that she spoke to the INEM President this Monday about the need to reshape the information and material available to all partners working with him. And that this Tuesday there will be a meeting of the National Public Health Council to reflect on the response capacity of each entity.\n",

But the company, alarmed, reminds users that the game is not for collecting information and forwards it to the World Health Organisation (WHO) website, says El Mundo.\nCreating an epidemic, virus mutations, admiring the virtues and relentless way in which it spreads and basically building panic in society, aiming at eliminating the world's population, are the outlines of the game created by Ndemic Creations, which has reached over 120 million customers in the last eight years.\nThe coronavirus originated in Wuhan in recent weeks and has already killed at least ten people, infecting other 4500, confirmed the Chinese authorities this Tuesday.\nEvery time something like this happens, the game goes viral and attracts a lot of people. That is exactly what the company explained on Friday when, on the official social media pages of the game, it reported that the site was down because there were too many online players. And he wrote, in a statement, that there are those who download the game to gather information and understand the complexities of the outbreaks.\n\"We designed the game specifically to be realistic and informative,\" says the company, noting that \"it is a game, not a scientific model\", advising stakeholders to seek information at appropriate locations such as the WHO.\n\"Can you contaminate the world? \"Thus begins the description of the game.

The incubation period is on average three to seven days, not exceeding the two weeks, added the entity cited by the South China Morning Post.\nAt a press conference in Beijing, where this Monday the first death was confirmed, the head of the medical administration department of that committee, Jiao Yahui, revealed that the lack of medical supplies constitutes an important obstacle to China's efforts to contain the outbreak and treat infected people.\nAccording to the person in charge, about six thousand health workers are being mobilized from all over the country to Wuhan, Hubei capital and city where the first cases occurred, and to seven other cities in the province. In Wuhan, more than ten thousand hospital beds were made available to accommodate the increasing number of patients.\nHowever, Jiao acknowledged that part of the medical staff cannot be deployed immediately due to lack of equipment such as protective clothing.\n\"The virus is highly contagious\", he stressed, nevertheless, that \"there is no credible evidence that the disease is contagious during the incubation period\".\nAlso according to the health officer, this coronavirus strain is 85% similar to Acute Grave Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which infected more than eight thousand people and killed nearly 800 in a pandemic that spread through Asia between 2002 and 2003\nYeah.\nThe banks of mainland China extended the Lunar New Year's break to their employees until next Monday, February 3rd. The decision comes after the government authorities have extended the holiday period, which was due to end this Thursday, to try to limit population movements and help contain the spread of the outbreak.\nThe USA, Australia, Germany, France, Japan and Portugal, among other countries, are preparing with the Chinese authorities the withdrawal of their citizens from Wuhan. In this city, there are two dozen Portuguese.\nThe Wuhan region is under quarantine, a situation that affects 56 million people.\nIn addition to mainland China, cases of infection have been reported in Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the USA, Singapore, Vietnam, Nepal, Malaysia, France, Germany, Australia and Canada.\nThis Monday Germany became the second European country after France, affected by the coronavirus, with a case diagnosed in Bavaria.\n",

In Europe, the number arrived on Sunday at 39, with two new infections detected in Spain in the United Kingdom.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO), which declared an international public health emergency in mid-January, indicated on Saturday that cases of contagion reported daily in China are stabilising, but stressed that it was early to conclude that the epidemic had reached its peak.\nMeanwhile, the Chinese Central Bank announced this Sunday that it will inject 300 billion yuan (43 billion dollars) next week to help companies involved in the fight against the viral epidemic.\nThe epidemic is paralyzing large areas of the country's economy and threatening them to slow down economically.\nOn Monday, the Bank of China will release the first tranche of special funds to help financial institutions lend to key companies involved in the prevention and control of the epidemic.\nThe lieutenant governor of the Bank of China, Liu Guoqiang, said on the website of the Chinese supervisor that nine major national banks, in addition to local banks in ten provinces and cities, are eligible to contract these funds.\nWe are talking about ten regions including Hubei Province, the epicenter of the new coronavirus epidemic, as well as Zhejiang, Guangdong, the Beijing capital and the Shanghai financial centre.\n\"This financial boost is intended to help national and local companies,\" said Liu quoted by the agency France Presse.\n",

That's why \"she was rested,\" she underlined the interior designer.\nOnly on Sunday a man of Chinese nationality died in the Philippines from pneumonia caused by the Wuhan coronavirus, the first death registered outside China. This has led the Filipino authorities to'tighten'the security measures even more, which includes, for example, banning all foreigners arriving from China.\nAlso, James Miranda, a Portuguese lawyer living in Macao, who went to the Philippines with his girlfriend \"to enjoy some holidays and escape the confusion usually introduced during the Chinese New Year period\", also saw his flight cancelled on Sunday.\nThe two departed from Macau on January 24th, dressed in a mask and disinfectant sprays, Lusa told him.\n\"The trip went as planned, although we felt some extra care at the airport- the overwhelming majority of people wore masks and measured the fever at the entrance of luggage control,\" he said, and he added that on arrival in Cebu, Philippines, they were evaluated by a machine that measured temperature\nYeah.\nOn the day of their supposed return, they were to take the plane from Manila to Macao and were \"informed by the airline that all flights had been cancelled from that time, without any prospect of resuming normal operation\".\n\"We were then advised by the airline itself to look for flights in other companies whose operations had not yet been affected, as the confusion at the airport was taking place and the alternative flights were drastically reduced (as prices were rocketing every minute)\", said the Portuguese jurist of 27 years.\nLiliana managed to arrange a flight to Macau at dawn on Wednesday, from Manila, and just as Tiago hopes to be able to return to work, it has already been delayed at least two days due to these constraints.\nThe hope is that the flight \"will not be cancelled at the last minute again\", said Liliana, an idea corroborated by James: \"we hope that everything will proceed without further delay from here on this long-awaited return to Macao\".\nAt a press conference, the Macao Government said it received four requests, eight persons, for assistance from Macao residents who are being held in the Philippines, but none of these requests are of Portuguese nationality.\nThe Macao authorities announced on Sunday the eighth case of a new coronavirus in the territory, the first case of infection of a Macao resident, since all other infected by the virus are from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the center of the outbreak.\nChina rose this Monday to 362 dead and more than 17 thousand infected with the balance of the pneumonia outbreak caused by a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) detected last December in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province (centre), including a Chinese citizen who died in the Philippines.\nSince December, 17.205 cases have emerged across China of the disease which has led the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare a world emergency and has already spread to twenty countries.\nMIM/ VM\nLusa/End\n",

As for the 16 previously announced cases, none is critically ill. All of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving,\" MOH said. \n The 17th case is a 47-year-old female Singapore citizen who travelled to Wuhan. \n \"She was one of the Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30, and arrived in Singapore on the same day. She was asymptomatic when she boarded the flight. \n \"Upon arrival at Changi Airport, she was found to have a fever during medical screening, and was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID),\" MOH said. \n The woman then tested positive for Wuhan coronavirus infection on Jan 31 at about 11pm. She is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. \n The 18th case is a 31-year-old female Chinese national who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22. \n She tested positive for infection on Feb 1 at about 2pm and is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. \n MOH said that it has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with the cases. \n In an update on the 16th confirmed case, which was announced on Jan 31, MOH said the 38-year-old male Chinese national arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22. \n He is currently warded in an isolation room at the Singapore General Hospital. The man reported that he was asymptomatic during his flight to Singapore and subsequently developed symptoms on Jan 23. \n He reported that he had stayed at his home at Nathan Road until Jan 29, when he took a taxi to SGH. He was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated. \n Subsequent test results confirmed 2019-nCoV infection on Jan 31 at about 2pm, MOH said. \n  \n As of 12pm on Feb 1, MOH said 231 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus. \n Test results for the remaining 25 cases are pending and contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. \n Once identified, MOH said it will closely monitor all close contacts and quarantine them for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient as a precautionary measure. \n All other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status. \n So far, MOH said it has identified 245 close contacts. Of the 177 who are still in Singapore, 172 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining five close contacts. \n  \n MOH also advised Singaporeans to defer all travel to Hubei province and all non-essential travel to mainland China. \n \"All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. \n \"Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (eg. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit,\" MOH said. \n  \n MOH added that it will continue to monitor the situation closely. \n \"As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated.\" \n Singapore on Friday announced that it will widen travel restrictions to include all new visitors with recent travel history to China. \n China also said it will send charter planes to bring home citizens from Hubei who are overseas \"as soon as possible\". \n The announcement came as a number of airlines, including Singapore Airlines and Scoot, announced they were halting or reducing flights to China as the country tackles the spread of the virus. \n In a bid to contain the possible spread of the virus, a total of 967 students and employees from schools in Singapore have been placed on leave of absence because of their recent travel history to China. \n On Saturday, authorities began distributing packs of four surgical masks for each Singapore household. There have been long queues for masks at pharmacies and retailers across the country. \n  \n Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Thursday reassured people that Singapore will have enough masks, provided the supply is managed \"appropriately\". \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram \n ",

It was scheduled to be a two-week cruise, but with that period running out this week, there had been worries about fuel and food supplies. Many on board are elderly and there was also concerns they could be running out of medicines.\nTo kill time and break up the monotony of endless ocean scrolling past cabin windows, the ship’s crew have organised dozens of activities to keep people occupied, tourists on board the vessel told Reuters.\nPeople could be seen playing chess and doing puzzles on Wednesday, in some of the first pictures published by media of life aboard the ship.\nOther activities on offer included colouring-in for adults; teeth whitening; poker tournaments; whisky tasting; even a lecture on modern China which delved into the economics of collective farming, according to passengers on board and a copy of the ship’s activity programme seen by Reuters.\nPassengers on board the ship have been subjected to regular health checks, according to Holland America, the ship operator and a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp (CCL.N). There have been no reported cases of the coronavirus on board.\nStoking fears of authorities in countries on the ship’s route has been the ongoing quarantine in Japan of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, also managed by a unit of Carnival Corp. A total of 175 out of the 3,700 people on board the Diamond Princess have tested positive for the coronavirus.\nLate on Wednesday, the Westerdam changed its course away from Bangkok and began heading towards Cambodia, according to data published by the Marine Traffic ship tracking website.\nEarlier, the Thai Navy “Bhumibol Adulyadej” warship could be seen escorting the Westerdam in waters just off the Thai coast, according to passengers and Marine Traffic.\nDespite the uncertainty, crew members had staged a farewell ceremony for passengers on Wednesday morning, singing to the tune of the 1979 hit “We Are Family” by Sister Sledge.\nElsewhere on board, the patience of some passengers has been tested by the prolonged uncertainty, Jones said, as some people pushed and shoved for access to one of the ship’s only available computers and printers, to re-book flights home.\n“Hard to imagine these senior cruisers coming to blows but guess that happened,” said Jones. “It’s funny and sad at the same time”.\n",

The previous record rise in the toll was 103 on Feb. 10.\nThe grim new tally came a day after China had reported its lowest number of new coronavirus cases in two weeks, bolstering a forecast by Beijing's senior medical adviser for the outbreak there to end by April.\nBut the 2,015 new confirmed cases reported in mainland China on Wednesday was dwarfed by the 14,840 new cases reported in Hubei alone on Thursday, when provincial officials said they had adopted a new methodology for counting infections.\nIt was not immediately clear how the new methodology affected the results, nor why the death toll rose so sharply.\nAsian stock markets wobbled and the safe-havens of the Japanese yen, gold and bonds rose after the Hubei numbers were reported. [MKTS/GLOB]\nResults from Chinese trials testing a combination of antiviral drugs used to treat HIV against the new coronavirus are due in weeks, but experts say a vaccine could still be months away.\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned any apparent slowdown in the spread of the epidemic should be viewed with \"extreme caution\".\n\"This outbreak could still go in any direction,\" he told a briefing in Geneva.\nAnother expert said that while the coronavirus may be peaking in China, this was not the case elsewhere.\n\"It has spread to other places where it's the beginning of the outbreak,\" Dale Fisher, head of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network coordinated by the WHO, said in an interview in Singapore. \"In Singapore, we are at the beginning.\"\nSingapore has 50 cases, including one found at its biggest bank, DBS, on Wednesday that caused an evacuation at the head office.\nHundreds of infections have been reported in more than two dozen other countries and territories, but only two people have died from the virus outside mainland China - one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines.\nTedros said a WHO-led advance team that traveled to China this week had made good progress on the composition and scope of its work.\nThe head of the WHO's emergency program, Dr. Mike Ryan, said it was too early \"to predict the beginning, the middle or end of the epidemic\".\nQUARANTINED CRUISES\nThe biggest cluster of cases outside China is on a cruise ship quarantined off the Japanese port of Yokohama, with 175 of about 3,700 people on board having tested positive.\nThe ship's operator, Carnival Corp, is among foreign companies taking a hit from the outbreak, with many flights suspended and businesses disrupted.\nPlanemaker Boeing said airlines were facing a fall in profits as the crisis reduces passenger demand and prolongs weakness in economically sensitive air freight.\nGlobal ship deliveries have also been dented as yards in China, one of the biggest shipbuilders, struggle to get fully back to work.\nThere was a happy ending in sight for another cruise ship, the MS Westerdam, which Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines had refused to let dock over fears one of its 1,455 passengers and 802 crew might have the virus.\nCambodia agreed to let it land, the Holland America Line said.\n\"This is an example of international solidarity we have been consistently calling for,\" WHO chief Tedros said. \"Outbreaks can bring out the best and the worst in people.\"\nThe outbreak is suspected to have originated in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan in December.

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Reuters) - Alibaba Group Holding Ltd warned of a drop in revenues at its key e-commerce businesses this quarter as the coronavirus sweeping China hits supply chains and deliveries.\nThe warning from executives came during an earnings call for the quarter ending in December 2019, during which the company beat analyst estimates and brought in record transactions for its annual Singles’ Day shopping event.\nCEO Daniel Zhang said the delayed return to work following the Lunar New Year, due to the virus outbreak which has killed more than 1,350 people in China and infected thousands more, had caused problems for merchants and delays in fulfilling orders.\nHe said food delivery orders had dropped year-on-year due to the number of restaurants that had closed as a result of the outbreak. And while the company has seen a surge in demand for goods from its Hema supermarkets, it has been held back by limited delivery capacity.\nFinance chief Maggie Wu said most of Alibaba’s businesses that rely on the sale of physical goods would likely see a decline in revenues this quarter.\n“We like other businesses are not immune to supply and demand,” she said. “Their recovery and long term success will translate to long term growth for Alibaba Group.”\nDespite the downbeat forecast, Zhang said that as of Monday Alibaba had observed more people in large cities going back to work and logistics networks returning to normal operations.\nHe also said DingTalk, the company’s enterprise chat app, had seen “explosive growth” during the crisis as white collar businesses and schools use it for remote working and online lessons.\n“Alibaba’s earnings for the next couple of quarters are certainly likely to take a hit from the coronavirus outbreak. However, the company’s business is strong enough to withstand the brief downturn, with its cloud computing business set to lead the charge for a more positive outlook,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.\nAlibaba usually reports its highest revenue in the December quarter due to its mega Singles’ Day shopping bonanza in November. The company said sales during the 24-hour event hit a record $38.4 billion in 2019.\nThe group primarily generates revenue by selling advertising and promotional services to third-party merchants that list products on its e-commerce sites, Taobao and Tmall.\nThe company said it was supporting the fight against the coronavirus outbreak by ensuring supply of daily necessities and introducing relief measures for its merchants.\nAlibaba affiliate Ant Financial’s MYBank unit has said it will offer 20 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) in loans to companies in China in the wake of the outbreak.\nThe outbreak, which originated in the city of Wuhan, has resulted in companies laying off workers, seeking cheaper funding and struggling to restart production after an extended Lunar New year holiday, as supply chains are disrupted.\nAlibaba is often viewed as a window into the health of China’s consumer economy, which Beijing views as key to continued economic growth.\nThe epidemic is expected to pile more pressure on China’s economy, just as the government had hoped a preliminary deal with the United States would ease a protracted trade war that had weighed on its growth.\nSales in Alibaba’s core commerce business jumped 38% to 141.48 billion yuan in its third quarter ended Dec. 31, while revenue at its cloud computing unit surged 62% to 10.72 billion.\nNet income attributable to ordinary shareholders rose to 52.31 billion yuan from 33.05 billion.\nExcluding items, the company earned 18.19 yuan per American Depository Share (ADS). Analysts had expected 15.75 yuan per ADS, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\nTotal revenue rose about 38% to 161.46 billion yuan, beating estimates of 159.28 billion yuan.\nU.S.-listed shares of the company were up nearly 1% at $226.30 in premarket trade.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif./GENEVA (Reuters) - More than 300 American cruise liner passengers, including 14 who tested positive for coronavirus, were flown home to military bases in the United States after two weeks under quarantine off Japan.\nThe cruise ship Diamond Princess, which with more than 400 cases has by far the largest cluster outside China, has become the biggest test so far of other countries’ ability to contain an outbreak that has killed 1,772 people in China and five elsewhere.\nA ground crew in anti-contamination suits met the chartered jet that touched down at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, and passengers could be seen climbing down the stairs wearing face masks in the pre-dawn mist. Another flight landed at Travis Air Force Base in California hours earlier.\nAll the passengers were taken into a two-week quarantine.\nAlthough U.S. officials had said passengers with coronavirus symptoms would not be repatriated, 14 passengers found at the last minute to have tested positive were permitted to board the planes. The U.S. State Department said the infected passengers were exposed to other passengers for about 40 minutes before they were isolated.\nAcross mainland China, the total number of coronavirus cases rose by 2,051 to 70,635, according to the World Health Organization. That was slightly more new cases than were reported on Sunday, but hundreds fewer than reported on Saturday.\nChinese authorities say the decrease is a sign that measures taken to halt the spread of the disease are having an effect.\nHowever, epidemiologists say it is probably still too early to say how well the outbreak is being contained within China and its central Hubei province, where the virus first appeared. Official figures of new cases have leveled off in the past, only to jump suddenly after changes in methodology.\n“The real issue is whether we are seeing efficient community transmission outside of China and at the present time we are not observing that,” Mike Ryan, head of World Health Organization’s emergencies program, said at a news conference in Geneva.\nFewer than 700 cases have been reported in other countries and even within China the epidemic is affecting “a very tiny, tiny, tiny proportion of people,” Ryan said.\nChina has responded to the COVID-19 virus by locking down Hubei’s provincial capital Wuhan, a megacity of 11 million people, and imposing restrictions in a number of other cities.\nBut the ruling Communist Party is  under pressure to prevent the economy from crashing and to get people back to work.\nChina’s central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending on Monday, which is expected to pave the way for a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate on Thursday. Beijing has also announced plans for cuts in taxes and fees.\nEven so, economists expect China’s economic growth to slow. Ratings agency Moody’s on Monday lowered its 2020 GDP growth forecast to 5.2%, making it likely China would miss a goal to double GDP over the decade to 2020.\nAround half of all known cases of the virus outside China have been found aboard the Diamond Princess, which was ordered to stay under quarantine at the port of Yokohama on Feb. 3.\nSeveral other countries have announced plans to follow the United States in bringing passengers home. Around half of the 3,700 passengers and crew are Japanese.\nMatthew Smith, an American passenger who remained on the ship after refusing to board the voluntary repatriation flights, tweeted that staying behind was the “best decision ever”.\n“US Gov’t said they would not put anyone on the planes who was symptomatic, and they ended up knowingly and intentionally putting on 14 people who actually have the virus,” he wrote.\nAuthorities around the world were also trying to track down passengers from another cruise liner, the Westerdam, which was turned away from ports across Southeast Asia for two weeks before docking in Cambodia on Thursday.\nOne American passenger who disembarked in Cambodia tested positive for the virus in Malaysia on Saturday.\nCarnival Corp, which operates both cruise liners, said it was cooperating with authorities in trying to trace other passengers from the Westerdam. None of the other 1,454 passengers and 802 crew had reported any symptoms, it said.\nHundreds of passengers are still in Cambodia, either on the ship or in hotels.\nHolly Rauen, a passenger from Fort Myers, Florida, said she and others will be tested by Cambodian authorities. “We have no idea when we get to get home,” she said.\nAfter an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China needs to get back to work or will suffer severe economic consequences. There is a proposal to delay the opening of the annual session of parliament, due on Feb. 24.\nSome cities remain in lockdown, streets are deserted, employees are nervous, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country. Many factories have yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond.\nIn Japan, where data showed on Monday that the economy had already shrunk last quarter at the fastest pace in almost six years, the impact of the virus is expected to show up in the current quarter, stoking fears of recession.\nTrade-dependent Singapore downgraded its 2020 economic growth forecast and has said recession is possible. It is set to unveil measures to cushion the blow on Tuesday.\nOrganisers of the Tokyo Marathon have decided to limit the March 1 race to top-level athletes, banning 38,000 general participants, a person with knowledge of the issue told Reuters.\nJapan’s Imperial Household Agency said it would cancel Emperor Naruhito’s public birthday address on Feb. 23, his first since his coronation last year. The event regularly attracts tens of thousands of people to the inner grounds of the Imperial Palace in the heart of Tokyo.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "A shadowy church in South Korea has become the focus of the coronavirus outbreak in the country. At the heart of it is a 60-year-old coronavirus patient who may have come in contact with nearly 1200 people.\nAs South Korea battles to control the viral infection, the role of a religious congregation has come under the scanner.\nOn Sunday, the East Asian nation reported 123 new confirmed coronavirus cases and a fourth death from the virus, taking total infections to 556.\nMore than half the additional cases were found to be linked to a Shincheonji Church of Jesus congregation in the southeastern city of Daegu after a 61-year-old woman known as \"Patient 31\" who attended services at the church tested positive for the virus last week.\nWhat makes Patient 31 special? The woman had no recent record of overseas travel.\nWhile authorities call her \"super spreader\", the locals have dubbed her \"crazy ajumma (Korean for aunty)\". Diagnosed with pneumonia-like symptoms on February 18, the sexagenarian resisted doctors’ recommendations to get tested for coronavirus not once but twice.\nAunty's day out\nThe Daegu woman's story is nothing short of a Hollywood-style caper but the reality is quite grim. She was first admitted to a local hospital after an accident on February 7. While in hospital, she developed a fever but refused to get tested.\nShe was finally tested on February 17 and a day later was diagnosed with coronavirus.\nBut between first entering the hospital and finally being confirmed positive for COVID-19, Patient 31 stepped out on at least four different occasions. All very public places.\nFrom a buffet restaurant to a Korean-style public bath and then to church twice, Patient 31 is estimated to have come in contact with some 1,160 people.\nSouth Korean authorities are now pressed as they deal with the ramifications of the woman's trip around Daegu.\nChurch becomes epicentre\nThe biggest spread came from her attendance of the Sunday services at a branch of the mysterious Shincheonji Church of Jesus.\nSome 1,000 Shincheonji church followers who attended Sunday services with her have been quarantined at their homes while authorities screen them for the virus. Health authorities are also trying to monitor thousands of others.\nThe Shincheonji church blamed the woman for the spread of the disease, saying it has been advising followers since late January to stay home if they had travelled overseas or were experiencing even mild cold-like symptoms.\nHealth officials were screening some 9,300 church followers and said that 1,261 of them have exhibited cough and other symptoms. The authorities are scrambling to find churchgoers because many followers don't reveal their affiliation owing to the sect's reputation.\nAll 74 sites operated by the Shincheonji Church have been closed and churchgoers have been told to instead watch services online for a sect whose leader claims to be an angel of Christ, but who is dismissed by many outsiders as a cult leader.\nIts teachings revolve largely around the Book of Revelation, a chapter of the New Testament known mostly for its apocalyptic foreshadowing.\nAuthorities are trying to determine how Patient 31 contracted coronavirus given that she had no travel history with China. Now, church members have admitted to conducting evangelical missions with Koreans in northeastern China, some of whom were invited to South Korea.\nOfficials are also investigating a possible link between churchgoers and the spike in infections at the Cheongdo hospital, where many have been infected, mostly patients at a mental illness ward. The hospital has also recorded South Korea's fourth death from coronavirus.\nChurch or Doomsday cult?\nShincheonji, which translates as new heaven and new earth, was established in 1984 by Lee Man-hee, who has been accused by other Christian groups as a false prophet or a cult leader.\nThe church describes Lee as the Promised Pastor, an attendant of Jesus sent to testify what he claims are the fulfilled prophecies from the Book of Revelation. The church boasts of a membership of more than 1,50,000.\nShincheonji followers believe Lee Man-hee is immortal and has an eternal life, said Ji-il Tark at Busan Presbyterian University in South Korea.\nTo propagate their belief, they often approach their relatives and acquaintances or sneak to other churches without telling them they are Shincheonji members.\nTark said Shincheonji followers are likely more vulnerable to virus infections as they often sit very closely on the floor during services. At Shincheonji, attending church-related gatherings isn’t an option, but a requirement, he said.\nRituals followed at Shincheonji may have further exacerbated the spread of the virus as church members are expected to kneel 10cm apart and hold hands with each other.\nOne member told New York Times that churchgoers are restricted from wearing glasses or masks in premises.\nAlso a part of training? Not fearing diseases. For members of Shincheonji, getting sick is a \"sin\" because it \"prevents them from doing God’s work\".\nShincheonji founder Lee has termed coronavirus, \"an act of the devil who saw the rapid growth of Shincheonji and wants to destroy our advancement.\"\nAfter Patient 31's diagnosis was confirmed, the church is allegedly said to have told followers to continue their mission in small groups and deny any affiliation -- a charge that was denied officially.\nInterestingly, the Shincheonji also claims to have a big congregation in China's Wuhan -- the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.\n",

The overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland reached 74,576 and 2,118 people died of the deadly disease.\nAmid an uncertain scenario with no firm timeline available to end the virus, Xi told Khan in their first telephonic conversation after the virus broke out last month that China is capable of winning the battle against the outbreak and the disease will not undermine the foundation of China's long-term development, according to official media accounts.\nThe outbreak affected almost all the sectors including defence industries, according to the official media.\nThe immediate problem for both the countries due to the virus is growing pressure on Pakistan from nearly 1,000 Pakistanis who were held in the virus-hit Wuhan and Hubei province.\nIt is not clear why Pakistan chose not to evacuate its citizens while India other countries like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, who shared close relationship with China, evacuated their citizens.\nFour Pakistani students have been infected with the virus and Chinese officials said three of them have recovered.\nA Chinese official said that 29 foreigners contracted the virus but did not give details of their nationalities.\nIndia is due to send a third flight to evacuate the rest of about 100 Indians. So far 647 Indians and seven Maldivians have been airlifted from Wuhan.\nAccording to Dawn news, Xi assured Khan that Pakistani students in China were being treated as their own and authorities will spare no effort in ensuring their safety, health and well-being.\n",

IAG said further cancellations would follow in the coming days.\nLower air traffic growth projections prompted Spanish travel technology firm Amadeus (AMA.MC) to forecast slower 2020 core profit growth on Friday, but it stressed the outlook did not yet account for the uncertain impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\nTo deal with the drop in business, IAG said it was cutting costs, without giving details - joining the likes of Germany’s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and Amsterdam-based KLM (AIRF.PA) which have announced similar plans.\nIt also said flight cancellations would reduce capacity growth this year, although CEO Willie Walsh said the group could start to add capacity if other airlines failed.\nAirline stocks have been among the biggest casualties of a stock market rout this week as coronavirus fears have gripped investors. At 0845 GMT, IAG shares were down 8% at 474.59 pence, while easyJet (EZJ.L) stock was down 3% at 1,075 pence and Finnair (FIA1S.HE) was off 3.4% at 4.922 euros.\n(Graphic: Europe's Airlines - here)\nBudget carrier EasyJet reported a “significant” softening of demand into and out of its bases in northern Italy - the center of the biggest coronavirus outbreak in Europe - and a reduction across its other European markets.\nIt also said it would be cancelling some flights, particularly into and out of Italy, and that it would make cost savings across its business, without giving details.\n“We continue to monitor the situation carefully and will update the market in due course,” it said, adding it was too early to determine the impact on its results.\nFinnair, meanwhile, warned of a “significant” fall in operating profit this year due to virus-related disruption.\nFinland’s national airline also said its was scrapping its 2020 capacity growth target, and would look into cutting costs by 40-50 million euros ($44-54 million), with measures under consideration including temporary layoffs.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\nBy Clyde Russell\nLAUNCESTON, Australia, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The spread across the world of the Chinese coronavirus has probably wiped out global crude oil demand growth for 2020, but in something of an irony it’s likely to be China that will be responsible if any increase is eked out.\nThere is little doubt that the coronavirus, which started in the city of Wuhan and has killed more than 2,700 people so far, will hit Chinese crude consumption this month, and likely into March and April.\nBut it also seems to be the case that Beijing may finally be getting a handle on containing the virus, just as it ramps up in other countries, most notably South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy.\nThis makes it likely that Chinese refiners will be keen to resume operations that have been curtailed because of the virus, but this could be delayed until April.\nThere are two reasons for the delay in resuming full crude processing in China. Firstly, fuel inventories have to be drawn down and secondly March is traditionally a month when several refiners undertake scheduled maintenance, as it falls in the shoulder season between peak winter and summer demand.\nThere is also a difference between Chinese domestic fuel consumption, and the country’s overall crude demand, given Beijing is still filling its strategic petroleum reserve, and refiners are also boosting exports of refined products.\nThis means that while some estimates suggested Chinese fuel demand fell by up to 4 million barrels per day (bpd) this month as the coronavirus led to the quarantining of entire cities, the hit to crude imports may not be so dramatic.\nChina’s crude imports are expected at 10.53 million bpd for February, down from 10.69 million bpd in January, according to a report on Wednesday by Refinitiv Oil Research.\nA mere drop of 160,000 bpd isn’t much of a dent to demand, and if the final tally is in line with the Refinitiv forecast, it will put some of the more doom-laden predictions about China’s crude demand into perspective.\nHowever, it’s likely that the bigger hit to China’s oil imports will come in March, and possibly extend into April.\nRefinitiv vessel-tracking data is showing 136 vessels carrying 177.6 million barrels are already heading to China and expect to unload in March, already over half the expected deliveries in an average recent month.\nThis will also be far from the final total, given that more cargoes are likely to leave Middle Eastern and Russian ports in the next two weeks and still have time to reach China before the end of March.\nWhat the vessel-tracking and port data is suggesting is that while China’s imports of crude may be softer than they would have been in the absence of the coronavirus, they are still holding up pretty well and the drop is nowhere near as severe as the hit to domestic fuel consumption.\nIf Chinese crude imports do start to recover from April onwards, it means the market focus is likely shift to how big the impact of the coronavirus will be on the rest of the world.\nWith more new cases being reported outside of China for the first time on Wednesday, the risks are rising that the coronavirus may reach vulnerable countries in Africa and the Middle East, and could strain health systems even in developed countries.\nIt’s still a wait-and-see approach, but if travel bans and quarantine measures become commonplace across Europe, even forecasts for zero global oil demand this year may prove optimistic.\nHowever, the epidemic, along with fears that it may become a pandemic, is driving a slump in crude prices, with Brent futures dropping as low as $52.57 a barrel in early Asian trade on Thursday, the weakest intraday price in a year, and putting the decline since the peak this year on Jan. 8 to nearly 27%.\nAssuming China does contain the virus and its economy starts to recover as stimulus hopes are delivered, the current weak crude price may also drive increased buying for its strategic stockpiles.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK, Feb 27 (LPC) - Companies are warning that the fast-spreading coronavirus could disrupt operations and cut into earnings as the loan market feels the pinch from a selloff in equity markets.\nBorrowers including toy manufacturer Hasbro and publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt warned this week that production could be impacted by a slowdown at manufacturers due to the virus, which emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread around the globe.\nSome opportunistic loan financings have been pushed off amid the volatility, while the high-yield bond market has been in a holding pattern all week.\nThe most immediate economic impact is expected in China, but the risk of a pandemic could send ripples through financial markets globally. The virus will likely have the largest negative impact on goods and services sectors that rely on Chinese consumers and intermediary products, Moody’s Investors Service said this month.\nIn late January the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of the respiratory disease a ‘public health emergency of international concern.’ More than 81,000 people globally were infected as of February 26, it said.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen more than 11% this week. The LPC 100, a cohort of the 100 most liquid US loans, dropped 46bp this week through Wednesday.\nThe loan market tends to react slower than equities. At least one trader said there was a bit of a ‘buyers strike’ early in the week as firms sought to determine how best to position their portfolio.

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. public health officials said they have identified four “presumptive” coronavirus cases believed to have emerged from community transmission of the infection, signaling a turning point in efforts to contain the disease in the United States.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a statement on Friday citing three such cases newly diagnosed by state public health authorities - one each in California, Oregon and Washington state.\nIf confirmed by the CDC, together with a previous case of unknown origin announced on Wednesday in California, that would bring to four the number of diagnosed individuals in the United States with no history of travel to a country where the virus is circulating and no close contact with an infected person.\nThe three latest patients were diagnosed based on results obtained in their respective states from CDC-supplied test kits and are considered “presumptive positive” cases pending CDC confirmatory testing, the U.S. agency said.\nA fourth presumptive positive was also announced in Washington state on Friday, but that one is “likely travel-related,” the CDC said.\nStill, the three latest cases of apparent community transmission, plus the one identified earlier this week in California, are a sign the virus is now spreading within at least four separate locations up and down the U.S. West Coast.\nThey span nearly 900 miles from California’s Silicon Valley region in Santa Clara County north to the Puget Sound near Seattle.\n“What we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level, but we still don’t know to what degree,” said Dr. Sara Cody, the chief public health officer for Santa Clara County, speaking of the newly diagnosed case there, the latest of three in her county and the 10th statewide.\nEven as confirmation was pending there, the CDC sent a team to assist local authorities in tracing close contacts the patient had with others in a bid to curb transmission.\nUntil this week, the CDC had counted 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the U.S. public health system since Jan. 21, none fatal. Most were contracted by individuals while traveling in China, where the outbreak originated. Only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples.\nAn additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated from abroad, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan or from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, according to the CDC.\nThe latest flurry of cases came as the Trump administration said the United States would invoke a federal defense law to boost production of masks, gloves, gowns and other items needed to protect medical personnel from exposure.\nAround the world, more countries are reporting new infections, companies have curtailed travel and global stock markets have tumbled.\nPresident Donald Trump said at the White House on Friday the United States will decide “very soon” about whether to bar entry to travelers from countries other than China where community transmission has emerged.\nAt a rally in South Carolina on Friday night, Trump defended his administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak and accused Democrats of politicizing the disease.\n“This is their new hoax,” Trump said at the event, held a day before the state’s Democratic presidential primary.\nThe U.S. State Department has issued travel advisories for several nations and on Friday it said Americans should reconsider travel to Italy, where nearly 900 coronavirus cases have been confirmed. A similar warning was issued earlier this week for South Korea, which has hundreds of infections.\nA government task force appointed by Trump to deal with the threat will meet at the White House on Saturday morning, according to an administration official.\nLatest figures from China, where the outbreak started late last year, indicated that nearly 80,000 people have been infected, with more than 2,800 deaths. The World Health Organization reported 57 deaths in 46 other countries.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a closed-door briefing in the U.S. House of Representatives that sustained spread of the coronavirus meant there would be many more infections in the United States, according to a source.\nFauci warned lawmakers the country lacked enough testing resources, the source said on condition of anonymity. The CDC said it has revised its criteria for who should be tested and is ramping up testing capabilities.\n“Our goal is to have every state and local health department online and doing their own testing by the end of next week,” CDC official Nancy Messonier told reporters.\nA vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop, health officials have said.\nThe United States has decided to postpone a meeting with leaders of Southeast Asian countries it had planned to host on March 14 in Las Vegas because of worries about the outbreak.\nU.S. and global stocks plummeted as rattled investors braced for the prospect that a pandemic could further dent an already slowing world economy.\nThe S&P 500 .SPX fell for the seventh straight day on Friday, suffering its biggest weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis. Stocks cut losses right at the end of the session.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the Trump administration's response to the spreading coronavirus and faced contentious questions from Democrats about an attack that killed Iran's most powerful general.\nDemocrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee expressed frustration that the panel was afforded only two hours to question Pompeo, who until Friday had gone months without a public appearance on Capitol Hill.\nDemocratic Representative Gregory Meeks recalled Pompeo's \"thundering\" while in Congress about the need for testimony from one of his Democratic predecessors, Hillary Clinton.\nBut, \"for you, sir, we had to move heaven and earth to get you here for just two hours,\" Meeks said.\nDemocratic Representative Brad Sherman asked sarcastically whether Pompeo would return to Congress next week to detail the steps the administration was taking against the coronavirus or whether he would again wait months for his next public appearance.\nDemocratic committee chairman Representative Eliot Engel called it an \"embarrassment\" that the panel had been given such a short time to question Pompeo. The secretary said he had briefed Congress more than 70 times on Iran, rejecting allegations that he had not been accessible.\nThe hearing was meant to focus on the Trump administration's dealings with Iran and Iraq, but many of the questions centred on the coronavirus. Pompeo said he was confident that the administration had taken action to reduce the threat.\nThe COVID-19 illness caused by a new coronavirus that emerged in December in the Chinese city of Wuhan has stretched well beyond Asia. The global count of those infected as of Friday exceeds 83,000, with China still by far the hardest-hit country. Dozens of cases but no deaths have been confirmed in the United States.\nPompeo's testimony comes three weeks after the conclusion of the Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, who was accused of abusing his office by withholding aid from Ukraine while he was seeking an investigation into Democratic rival Joe Biden. Trump, who denied doing anything wrong, was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate.\nThe inquiry before House legislators featured the testimony of several foreign service officers, including some who had been enlisted to try to carry out the Republican president's wishes and expressed concerns over it.\nThough Pompeo was not a central figure to the impeachment inquiry, he has faced criticism for not doing more to stand up for a workforce that has been attacked by the president - including Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, who was removed last spring after a push by the president's allies.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The word \"cool\" keeps slipping out of 17-year-old pupil Avi Schiffmann. Actually, he was just trying to build a cool website, says Seattle teenager in the U.S. state of Washington.\n\"Clear, easily understandable and with up-to-date data on the Coronavirus spread\", explains the gymnast. With his page \"ncov2019.live\", the student closed an information gap early and attracted millions of users long before authorities or scientific institutes provided global figures on the pandemic.\nBy the end of December, Schiffmann posted his Coronavirus website online when China had just reported the first cases of the disease and no one had yet moved to Washington. \"It began after Christmas as a small project. Of course, I had no idea how big the virus and my website would become,\"the student says.\n\"There have been around twenty million visitors alone in the last 24-hour period,\" he says proudly. With the spread of the virus, there was also an exponential increase in use, 144 million in the last month. The comments on the page are full of praise: \"Great work\", \"Keep it up\", \"better than other sources of information\", writes users.\nThe homepage presents the most important facts about the worldwide Coronavirus crisis. Quick Facts provides information on the global numbers: cases of illness, deaths, the severely ill and cures. The figures are updated every minute. In other sections the data of continents, individual countries and US states follow. There are interactive maps and a wiki area with important information about Covid-19.\nEven as a child, the 17-year-old says he has learned to program. \"I've learned everything from YouTube videos about how to make a cool website to help people.\" But this is not a child's game, admitYeah.\nFirst, he tapped into Chinese government sites for his website to access information. He added sources from other countries, including news sites, the US Health Authority CDC and the World Health Organisation (WHO). The junior programmer developed a Scraping software that constantly collects data and constantly updates its website.\nHe spends every free minute on the computer, says Schiffmann, unless he's doing interviews. He has plenty of time, because even in the US state of Washington, because of the Corona crisis, schools and most businesses have been closed for a long time. People should largely stay in their homes. His other hobby was skiing, the wearer says, but also the ski areas should have closed all.\nThe student with the dark head has a younger sister, his mother is a doctor, the father a medical journalist. But his motive was not the medical phenomenon of the spread of the virus, but his interest in figures and facts. \"In the age of Fake News, it is important to find good sources and reliable figures,\" says Schiffmann.\nFake news about the Coronavirus seems to be spreading as fast as the pathogen itself. But who's behind it? The intention is not always clear to the Fake News researcher and communications scientist Tilman Klawier from Hohenheim University. In his view, if lies have often been spread in the past in order to make money by clicking or to bring one's own ideology among people, the motivation in the case of the Coronavirus is not necessarily recognizable. \"Perhaps it is an individual need for validity, boredom or simply a disturbed invention.\"\nAve Schiffmann has been working for a long time to integrate more complex links into the website. In addition to the absolute number of infections such as the increase in cases from week to weeYeah. Or a vaccine tracker with research results. Or statistics on the number of tests in different regions. It's the only way the ideas come out of him.\nAvi is also quick to criticize other websites. The CDC website of the Washington authorities was much too slow and always lagging behind with the figures, the student says. He also makes the much-used Corona Info page of the U.S. University of Johns Hopkins \"completely unusable\" on mobile devices.\nEvery day, the teenage boy goes through the head with the coronavirus numbers. \"Things will get much worse in the US if there are finally more tests,\" says Schiffmann. In Germany, the lower death rate among Corona infected would stand out. And one more thing to be noticed: \"Most visitors from Europe on my website come from Germany, already more than eight million users.\" This puts Germany in third place, after the USA and Taiwan.\nAn end to the Corona crisis is not yet in sight. But Schiffmann is already thinking ahead, for example about a new website name \"GermTracker.com\". \"Once this is over, I will come up with 20 new projects,\" says the student. \"I want to start my own company and do cool things to help the world.",

        "news_content_translate_en": "From Volkswagen and Audi to Daimler, Ford and Opel to Airbus: The Coronavirus pandemic is now also hitting flagships of industry with force. Tapes are silent for days or weeks.\nThis is partly justified by decreasing demand and disruptions in supply chains, but also by protecting workers from infections. \"The main goal is to slow down the spread of the corona virus as much as possible,\" said VW chief Herbert Diess.\nProduction stoppages are also likely to have consequences for suppliers of industrial giants, for example in mechanical engineering and chemistry, and for the pockets of employees, which are now largely dependent on short work. IG Metall requires financial subsidies for workers. \"Otherwise, the production workers in short-time work are threatened with losses in net wages up to 40 per cent,\" said union chief Jurg Hofmann on Tuesday.\nThe world's largest automobile manufacturer Volkswagen will now suspend production in numerous factories in China, the starting point of the pandemic. The planned production stoppages in the German VW plants due to the Coronavirus pandemic start this Thursday. The sites are then to temporarily suspend production for two weeks at the end of the late shift.\nThe VW-daughter Audi follows the example of the mother: she gradually downloads her works to the end of this week. In China, on the other hand, production had been progressively increased since mid-February, one speaker said. The truck manufacturer MAN, a VW subsidiary, is currently continuing production, but the company applied for short work. At Munich's VW competitor BMW, the works run regularly.\nFor the time being, many of the tapes are still silent at the Daimler car manufacturer because of the CoronavirusYeah. Much of the production in Europe will be closed for the first two weeks from this week, the group announced in the evening in Stuttgart. Both car and transport and commercial vehicle production were affected. By the end of this week the works will be shut down. \"With these measures, the company is doing its part to protect the workforce, to break the chain of infection and to curb the spread of this pandemic,\" it said. \"At the same time, this decision helps to prepare Daimler for a phase of temporarily lower demand and to secure the financial strength of the company.\"\nOpel is running the production down in its trunk plant, in which the middle-class car Insignia is installed. There was short-time work there before the Corona crisis, because the model sells only moderately. Opel is currently talking to the workers and the employment agency about the extension of short-time work, it said in an internal information from Monday.\nFord will hold the tapes from Thursday to the German sites in Cologne, Saarlouis and other locations in Europe, as the car manufacturer announced on Tuesday. The exception is motor plants in the UK. How long the production stop will last is still unclear, one speaker said. Short work by the end of the year had already been requested by the car manufacturer for the Cologne site in February. The company was initially unable to confirm whether this measure was also planned for other sites.\nAccording to its chairman, Hofmann, IG Metall supports temporary closures to protect production workers from the spread of the Coronavirus. Hofmann pointed out that many employees could continue to work in the home office. But for those who cannot, there must be financial compensationYeah. \"Here too, production workers must not be disadvantaged compared with other groups of workers who have the option of working on a mobile basis.\" In the large automobile factories, there are corresponding pay-as-you-go arrangements. It is now up to the employers'associations to regulate this across the board.\nGermany's mechanical engineers are concerned about the planned production stoppages in the automotive industry. \"As long as the workshops are not completely closed, our companies can theoretically continue to deliver the machines and plants ordered or carry out their service,\" said VDMA chief VolksVolksswirt Ralph Wiechers in Frankfurt. \"But the stronger the restrictions in our customer industries become, the stronger we are also hit as equipment.\"\nFor the chemical industry, which supplies paint and plastics for example, the automotive industry is one of the most important customers. The VCI does not yet have any production losses. However, the chemical industry is likely to be affected by temporarily paralysed factories in large corporations such as VW.\nIn recent days there have also been first confirmed cases of infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus in German VW factories, which can cause Covid-19 lung disease. VW was strongly criticised by the works council, many employees were not adequately informed and advised. The interruption on Friday will be too late.\nThe aircraft and armaments group Airbus temporarily ceases production in France and Spain, initially for four days, the company announced in Toulouse. Airbus is thus responding to the regulations adopted by the governments, such as the curfew imposed in France. The company now wants to quickly implement new safety and hygiene measures to restart productioYeah.\nThe situation is getting worse for Airbus competitor Boeing, who has already been hit: because of employees infected with the Coronavirus, health authorities would now have to decide on the further production of the aircraft manufacturer, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday (local time). The financial news agency Bloomberg, citing Insider, reported that Boeing was pressing the US government for short-term financial assistance for itself as well as for suppliers and airlines. Boeing refused to comment on both reports on demand. (dpa",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The consequences of the Coronavirus epidemic in China will increasingly affect German industry and trade in the coming weeks.\nAs many Chinese factories have been shut down for weeks and are currently operating only in limited quantities, there are no pre-products, parts or complete products processed or sold in China. The electronics sector is affected, among other things. Not only imports but also deliveries to China have been destroyed.\nIn fact, EU trade ministers wanted to discuss the issue on Thursday, but the meeting is cancelled. The average transport time from China to Europe by sea is six weeks, over land by freight train on the New Silk Road is about three weeks. Therefore, the effects of the Chinese coronation standstill are now being felt with delay on production and trade in Europe.\nWith imports of 52 billion euros, China is \"by far the largest foreign supplier for the German electrical market\", says Andreas Gontermann, the chief national value of the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industries (ZVEI). \"The delivery difficulties do not affect the industry across the board,\" he says. \"However, several companies report disruptions in the supply and production chains.\"\nGontermann figures the volume of intermediate products delivered from China to Germany at a value of ten billion euro a year. \"How much of it is at risk of delivery is difficult to estimate,\" says Gontermann. And that is not yet done: \"In addition, inputs from other countries can also contain Chinese inputs,\" he explains. The Japanese and South Korean economies are also currently being held back, and both countries are very important for the electronics industry.\nConsumers, too, are likely to feel the effects on the electricity marketsYeah. \"Currently, no supply bottlenecks can be identified due to the restrictions of the Coronavirus, we are currently expecting for April the first possible supply bottlenecks and rising product resistance prices,\" says Alexander Maier, Senior Vice President at Ingram Micro, a wholesaler for electrical and electronic products based in the Munich suburb of Aschheim. \"We are currently working on strategies to respond quickly to these impacts and continue to offer our customers the best possible product availability.\"\nThe car industry is also concerned.\" Production is currently in progress at all locations,\"says an audio speaker in Ingolstadt. Of course, it is not clear how the situation will develop in the medium term, particularly with regard to the supply chain. We try to alleviate potential bottlenecks through targeted measures.\"\nAudi is based in Bavaria, where companies are particularly dependent on foreign countries and earn more than half of their sales outside German borders. \"Supply chains between China and Bavaria are interrupted and will be even more severely interrupted in the coming weeks, for example, if pre-crisis products are processed and no further follow-up is achieved,\" says Bertram Brossardt, the chief manager of the Bavarian Economic Association (vbw).\nThe main import goods from China for the Bavarian economy are data processing equipment, electronic and optical products, electrical equipment and machines. \"We expect a disruption of the supply chains approximately proportional to the volume of the individual product groups,\" says Brossardt. This should apply similarly to companies in the rest of the Republic supplied from China.\nFor outsiders, the impact on the supply of medicines cannot be estimated. According to the Federal Institute for Medicinal Products and Medical Products in Bonn, there are currently no Coronavirus-related bottleneckYeah. But last week, India, where many imitation medicines are produced for the world market, limited exports of 26 common active substances, including paracetamol and several antibiotics.\nA major drug wholesaler is Phoenix Pharmahandel, based in Mannheim, and the company is walled: \"We cannot evaluate the issue of your request,\" a spokesman says. The Pharmaceutical Association Progenerika states that it is not assumed that there will be supply shortages in Germany until the summer 2020 due to Corona. What then? \"Not yet foreseen\" (dpa",

        "news_content_translate_en": "With the surprisingly large Covid-19 outbreak in Italy, there is growing concern about new cases in Germany. At first, undetected chains of infection are also possible here, according to experts. This is known for the Sars-CoV-2 virus and the Covid-19 disease it causes:\nHow contagious is the new Coronavirus?\nA value that many other people infect an infected person in the medium can still not be stated with certainty. It is clear that the virus spreads through droplet infection, such as coughing and talking. And it is also clear that the pathogen is significantly more infectious than initially assumed: unlike the closely related Sars pathogen, the Covid-19 virus also multiplies in the neck area. In the upper respiratory tract, the path of infection is much shorter than when an organism first has to get out of the lung and into another person's lungs. Flu viruses also multiply in the throat.\nIn addition, initial results indicate that the virus can also be spread over the digestive system and at least for a few days over surfaces. A previously underestimated risk might be that in stool samples of patients in the initial phase of Covid-19 disease \"quite relevant quantities\" of Sars-CoV-2 could be detected, for example Clemens Wendtner, chief physician of infectiology and tropical medicine at the Munich clinic Schwabing, explained.\nThe extent to which people who are largely or entirely symptom-free may be infectious is not yet clear.\nWhat is the risk of infection in Germany?\nWith the large number of proven infections in Italy, travel also increases the risk of Covid-19 being smuggled into Germany. The risk of clusters similar to those in Italy occurring elsewhere in Europe is currently considered moderat e to high, said ECDC on Sunday eveninYeah. Once inserted, the virus can quickly spread. ECDC Director Andrea Ammon said that it is expected that there will be further cases in Italy and possibly in other parts of the EU in the coming days.\nExperts believe that there could be other infection chains in European countries for a long time, of which no one is aware, including in Germany. \"At some point, undetected infections are likely to be noticed suddenly,\" Berlin virologist Christian Drosten recently explained.\nWhat would an outbreak in Germany mean?\nAn infection wave in this country could mean, among other things, full waiting areas and medical practices, occupied intensive beds and completely overloaded health offices, Berlin virologist Christian Drosten recently said. The Charity's CEO, Heyo Kroemer, stressed in mid-February that preparations were being made intensively. The hospital system generally runs at full load in winter, but in the case of Sars-CoV-2 infections in the country, the facilities would have room for manoeuvre, for example by moving non-urgent operations.\nThe Robert Koch Institute (RKI) said the goal in Germany was to delay a wave of disease in order to prevent the Covid-19 and the current flu waves from collapsing. \"We must try with reasonable effort to slow down the spread in order to mitigate an intense strain on the health system,\" said threats. \"The number of infections should be extended for as long as possible.\"\nHow dangerous is the virus?\nAccording to an analysis presented by the Chinese health authority, a 2,3 percent of those infected with Sars-CoV-2 die in the country. It is therefore mainly old people who are affected and those with severe pre-existing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases or diabeteYeah. For people over eighty years, the death rate calculated from the data available there is almost fifteen per cent, so they die in this age group in China on average fifteen per cent infected. In the group of ten to 39-year-old people, 0,2 percent of the infected die, i.e. about two percent of 1000 affected.\nIn the vast majority of cases, according to the health authority more than 80-percent, people who have contracted Covid-19 show only mild symptoms. Few 14 percent of those affected develop severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, almost five percent life-threatening effects such as respiratory arrest, septic shock or multi-organ failure.\nThe Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) also spoke of a good 80-percent mild course of infection, referring to the data analysis from China. There are also relatively few cases in children, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. It is still unclear why this is so.\nExperts believe that mortality is actually lower than expected in China, partly because many mild-acting infections are not recorded in Chinese statistics. But there are no reliable analyses of mortality from other countries so far.\nWhat symptoms does the new Coronavirus cause?\nMany people have only mild cold symptoms with frostbite and sore throat or no symptoms at all. In addition, fever, cough and respiratory problems can occur, as they do with a flu. Headaches or diarrhoea are also possible. The incubation period, the period between infection and onset of symptoms, is usually two to 14 days at the current stage. That's the reason we isolate suspect cases for two weeks.\nHow can the new lung disease be treated?\nThere is no special treatment for Covid-19 diseasYeah. Severely ill patients are treated symptomatically: with fever-reducing agents, the treatment of possible additional bacterial infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation.\nIs there a protective vaccine?\nNope. Several laboratories worldwide are currently researching vaccines such as the flu vaccine. However, the development of protective vaccination takes a long time. The first experimental vaccines could be available this year, said the virologist Gerd Sutter of the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich recently. Whether and when they could be tested on humans was another matter. \"The development of a vaccine is a long, arduous process, especially the approval and clinical examination of a candidate.\"\nWHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan believes that the first human vaccine tests could begin in three to four months. However, a certified vaccine for extensive use will probably not be available until 18 months.\nDo we have a pandemic at Covid-19 yet?\nA pandemic often means the spread of a disease in humans across all continents. A region is considered to be \"affected\" if there are transmission chains and not just individual entrances by travellers. Reports of such infection chains are still missing from Africa and America. The question was whether certain African and South American countries are testing the virus at all and whether cases are detected, said the Berlin virologist Christian Drosten.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) no longer uses the term pandemic and does not explain it. The seriousness of a disease is measured only by the declaration of an \"international emergency\". This has nothing to do with the common definition of pandemiYeah.\nWhat kind of virus is Sars-CoV-2?\nSars-2-CoV, which is likely to be passed on to humans in November or December in a wildlife market in Wuhan, China, is one of the Coronaviruses. They are so named because of the jagged structures on their surface. Seven representatives of this group cause respiratory diseases in humans, such as colds or coughing.\nSars-CoV-2 is included by three people who are known to sometimes cause severe symptoms. Also from China, Sars-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) was known to 2002/2003 around 8000 cases, around 800 people died. ==References====External links====External links==* Official website It is less contagious, but more aggressive: from around 2500 infected to November 2019, nearly 860- about every third died.\nThe Covid-19-agent Sars-CoV-2 is genetically very closely related to the Sars-CoV, which is why it has been given a very similar technical name.\nHow can I protect myself?\nTo protect against this virus as well as other viruses, experts recommend common hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectants and distance to the sick. Experts estimate the benefits of normal respiratory masks, as seen everywhere on the streets in China at the moment, to be rather low. It can be useful to limit hugs and shakes and not touch surfaces touched by many people such as doorknobs, handles and elevator buttons.\nWhat good is a mouthpiece?\n\"Healthy people travelling in Germany do not need a mask\", says a spokesman for the German Pharmaceutical Association (ABDA). A simple mouth-nose protection, as nurses and doctors wear in surgeries, does not protect against infection with the new Sars-CoV-2 virus anyway.\nThere are also proper respiratory masks with built-in filteYeah. But even then, so-called FFP2 and FFP3 masks can prevent infection by dripping, if they are sitting properly. \"But this is nonsense in everyday life,\" said Bernd Salzberger of Regensburg University Hospital, president of the German Society for Infectiology. Especially with a mask like that, it's hard to breathe.\nBecause of the new Coronavirus, protective masks have been sold out in many pharmacies for weeks and they are scarcely supplied. This is explained by the Federal Federation of Pharmaceutical Wholesale (PHAGRO).\nWhen will Coronavirus be tested?\nIn the routine monitoring of acute respiratory diseases in Germany with the help of selected medical practices, attention is now also being paid to the new Coronavirus. As the Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) announced in Berlin on Monday, the working group Influenza (AGI) has integrated a Sars-CoV-2 study \"into the spectrum of pathogens to be investigated\". According to RKI data, respiratory tests are now being analysed from patients from 100 to 150 medical practices. The MDR had previously reported on the subject.\nThe annual monitoring by the AGI shall cover, inter alia, the course and severity of respiratory diseases and the characteristics of each circulating agent. The sample of participating medical practices is intended to identify trends. Above all, it is the flu that causes thousands of people in Germany to get sick every year.

        "news_content_translate_en": "It is becoming increasingly clear in Germany too: Sars-CoV-2 can no longer be stopped. What is known about the virus and the Covid-19 disease it causes?\nHow far will Sars-CoV-2 spread in Germany?\n\"Further cases, infection chains and outbreaks in Germany must be anticipated,\" says Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) in Berlin. Since there is no immunity against a new pathogen in the population at first, a wave of spread can capture large parts of it. For Germany, the Berlin virologist Christian Drosten expects a high total infection rate. \"They will probably get 60 to 70 percent, but we do not know in what time,\" he said. \"This can take two years or even longer.\"\nWhat does the epidemic mean for the health system and society?\nThis depends crucially on one factor: the rate of spread. The better it manages to keep the infection rate down, the less pressure on the medical system and society will be, Drosten says. The problem is that infections occur especially when compressed in a short time. Then full waiting areas and medical practices threaten, occupied intensive beds and completely overloaded health services. Many workers would be absent, and schools, institutes and other institutions could also face problems due to sick staff. According to the estimates presented by the British Government, there could be any fifth of the workforce lost in the high-phase as the wave of disease progresses.\nHow contagious is the new Coronavirus?\nA value that many other people infect an infected person in the medium cannot yet be stated with certainty. It is currently the most difficult factor to estimate, says ThreatYeah. There are indications that an infected person is infecting three more people on average, but this value is very uncertain. An epidemic is stopped if an infected person infects less than one other person on average.\nThe virus multiplies in the throat and spreads mainly through droplets such as coughing and speaking. \"They may fly one and a half meters and fall to the ground relatively quickly,\" Drosten explains. \"It is the inhalation of such a cloud that infects you in most cases.\" Only in contact situations is there a real risk, for example if you have talked to an infected person for about a quarter of an hour or longer.\nThe incubation period, the period between infection and onset of symptoms, is usually two to 14 days at the current stage. That's the reason we isolate suspect cases for two weeks.\nHow dangerous is the virus?\nMost people have only mild cold symptoms with frostbite and sore throat or no symptoms at all. In addition, fever and cough can occur, as they do with a flu. Headaches or diarrhoea are also possible.\nApproximately 15 of 100 infected patients are seriously ill, as the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) called it. You'll get respiratory distress or pneumonia. Most people at risk, such as cancer patients in chemotherapy, elderly people and those with pre-existing diseases such as cardiovascular disease or diabetic organ damage, are affected.\nFatalities such as respiratory arrest, septic shock or multi-organ failure are rare. According to current data, the Covid-19 death rate is approximately 0.3 to 0.7 per cent, Drosten says. This means that from 1000 infected 3 to 7 die. The actual rate is probably even loweYeah.\nAn analysis in China recently showed that around two to three percent of those infected with Sars-CoV-2 die in the country. Experts assume that this estimate is too high because many mild infections have not been included in the statistics. According to the same analysis, the death rate in people over 80's is close to fifteen per cent, so in this age group in China, according to current statistics, about 15 out of 100 infected people are dying. In the group of ten to 39-year-old people there are 0,2 percent of the infected, i.e. about two percent of 1000 affected.\nHow can the new lung disease be treated?\nThere is no special treatment for Covid-19 disease. Severely ill patients are treated symptomatically: with fever-reducing agents, the treatment of possible additional bacterial infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation. Antiviral medicines are also tested in individual cases.\nIs there a protective vaccine?\nNope. Several laboratories worldwide are currently researching vaccines such as those for influenza. However, the development of protective vaccination takes a long time. Soumya Swaminathan, a leading scientist at the World Health Organisation (WHO), believes that a certified vaccine for widespread use is unlikely to be available for use in 18 months.\nAccording to Health Minister Alex Azar, the FDA gave the go-ahead for the first clinical trials of a potential vaccine against the new Coronavirus. The director of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, stressed that this would not change the current schedule for a possible vaccine. \"The whole process will take at least one or a half year\"\nHow can I currently protect myself from infection?\nTo protect against this virus as well as other viruses, experts recommend common hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectants and distance to the sick. Experts estimate the benefits of normal breathing masks to be rather low. It can help to limit hugs and hand shakes and not touch surfaces touched by many people such as doorknobs, handles and elevator buttons.\nDuring a stay in public spaces one should avoid touching the nasal mucous membranes and rubbing the eyes, said Graifswald hygienist Gunter Kampf. \"The virus wants to get into the airway.\" When you get home you should wash your hands thoroughly first.\nCan I get infected if I get a package from China or other risk areas?\nIn principle, the WHO says it is unclear how long the virus will survive on surfaces. Studies suggested that it would be a few hours or days depending on conditions such as surface, temperature or humidity. The probability that an infected product contaminates with the virus is considered low by the Authority. The risk that a recipient might become infected by a package exposed to different conditions and temperatures during transport was also low. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) also says that imported foods and goods such as toys, computers or clothing are unlikely to be sources of infection.\nCan my pet transmit the virus?\nAccording to an expert, there is little risk of transmission by pets. A case reported in South Korea in which Sars-CoV-2 was reported to have been detected in a dog was not confirmed in scientific literature, said Albert Osterhaus, a virologist at Hannover Veterinary CollegeYeah. It cannot be completely ruled out, but it is unlikely that this can play a role in the transmission to humans, if at all, via the skin and the fur.\nWhat do I do if I'm afraid I'm infected?\nDo not go directly to a practice or emergency room. If you have symptoms and are afraid of Covid-19, for example because of contact with an infected person, you should first contact your doctor or health department by phone. \"Because if you really should be sick of it, then you don't necessarily have to put it in a fully-occupied waiting room with already weakened immune systems,\" explains the German Association of Physicians, Christian Schmuck. In several federal states, there is currently consideration of setting up special centres as a point of contact for possible Sars-CoV infected. At the Berlin Charter, for example, such a separate investigation centre for suspected cases is already in operation.\nWhat can the state do in an emergency?\nThe main regulation is the National Infection Protection Act (IfSG). A spokesman for the Bavarian Ministry of Health summarises: \"If necessary, important fundamental rights such as the freedom of the person can also be According to the Bavarian State Attorney Stephan Rixen, authorities may require blood and skin and mucous membranes to be removed. \"Suspects of illness\" and \"Suspects of infection\", as the law expresses, could also be subject to a professional prohibition. For the protection of others, people could also be \"isolated in a suitable hospital or otherwise in a suitable way\", the law states.\nWill the situation change in the spring?\nThe flu and other cold diseases have the main season in winteYeah. Also with Sars-CoV-2, there is the hope that the epidemic may flare up in the warmer months, at least temporarily. Helpful effects, according to threats, are \"the warmth of summer, UV rays and the fact that people are out more and less able to infect each other\". In the second half of the year, however, we in Europe would have to be prepared for it to get colder again and for this additional effect to disappear. (dpa",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The health department is currently preparing a crisis staff to be equipped for the Coronavirus emergency. According to Martin Goetz, Head of Unit for Infection Protection at the Health Senator, the seven deaths and 220 confirmed patients in Italy have \"brought new dynamics to the development\". In the event that the Covid-19 virus is also present in the Hanseatic City, the Authority intends to arm itself with the Crisis Rod.\nThe atmosphere is no longer calm as it was three weeks ago, Goetz reports from an expert conference on Monday. Representatives of all the federal states, the Federal Republic and the Berlin Robert-Koch Institute participated. There was also the question of whether the Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto concerned would in future be run as risk areas. Although there was no such decision until the evening, it was judged by God as \"very likely\" for the coming days. This depends on the further development in Italy.\nThe Robert Koch Institute has already extended its recommendations on risk areas on Monday, without naming Italy directly. There are countries and regions where individual cases of infection have occurred with and without traceability of the infection chains or even clusters of infections, it says. In case of symptoms and stays in such countries, consider Covid-19 as a possible diagnosis.\nThe institution has also adjusted its overall risk assessment. Imports of further cases into Germany should be expected. Further transmissions, infection chains and local infections in Germany were possible. It should be assumed that even if the health risks in Germany are currently estimated to be low, it will no longer be possible to stop the spread of the disease worldwideYeah.\nAgainst this background, Goetz considers it useful to at least prepare a Bremer Crisis Staff. This means that the Senate Researchers as well as the fire brigade and police appoint their respective leaders \"in order to be able to kill the switch immediately in an emergency\". The task of a crisis unit is to use the possibilities provided for in the Infection Protection Act to prevent further diseases. It is possible to close down institutions such as schools or kitas or, as in Italy, seal off entire cities. What is \"appropriate and proportionate\" is to be seen, says Goetz. He reports that the measures in Italy are largely regarded by the German experts as \"excessive\". \"We are also rather shocked by the introduction of 20 patients into intensive care.\"\nIf Italian regions were to be classified as risk areas, the number of cases requiring clarification would also increase significantly in Bremen. Unlike China, for example, there are direct flights to Italy. Overall, travel between Italy and Germany is eight times higher than between Germany and China.\nA specific suspicion of a disease with the new virus exists when two circumstances come together: on the one hand, the clinical symptoms of the disease such as cough, fever and shortness of breath, on the other hand, the person concerned must have had contact with a confirmed Covid-19 patient in the fourteen days preceding that, or must have stayed in a risk area. These are regions in China, Korea and Iran, as recommended by the Robert Koch Institute.\nAccording to Holger Schelb of the Bremen Association of Physicians, the physicians are asked to clarify only clinical symptoms and the history, but not to make any further diagnosisYeah. \"Should there be a need for clarification, depending on the severity of the symptom, we would either send the patient to a hospital or send him home with an invitation to stay there,\" says Schelb. Further investigations shall be carried out by the Office in order to obtain all information immediately. According to Schelb, however, no such process has yet taken place in Bremen",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Apple will miss only a few weeks old sales forecast for the current quarter due to the Coronavirus outbreak in China.\nOn iPhones, there are supply bottlenecks because production in China is slower than planned, the group reported. In addition, the sale of Apple equipment in China had recently been suppressed, as many shops, and also the stores of the company, had been temporarily closed and badly visited.\nFor these reasons, it was said that the turnover forecast for this quarter, issued at the end of January, was no longer valid. Apple had already indicated an unusually wide range of 63 to 67 billions of dollars, referring to the Coronavirus risks. There was no new forecast now. The restrictions on the business were only temporary, the Group stressed. In the previous quarter, Apple had generated billions of dollars in revenue.\nThe Apple-ready plants such as Foxconn and Pegatron and the main suppliers are located outside the province of Hubei, which is particularly affected by the new lung disease Covid-19. But in China, the traditional Chinese New Year holiday was extended elsewhere to avoid a spread. All production facilities were running again. But Apple warned: \"The iPhone supply bottlenecks will temporarily affect global sales.\"\nThe Financial Times reported on Tuesday that the largest iPhone plant in Zhengzhou would not allow workers returning from other regions of China to work for the time being to reduce the risk of infection with the Sars-CoV-2 virus.\nThe situation was in flux, the group explained and more information on the impact on the Apple business should only be available with the figures for the current quarter in ApriYeah.\nIn China, only part of the well 40 Apple stores with reduced opening hours has been reopened, but online sales continue. At the moment, however, life in large parts of the country is affected by the Coronavirus outbreak. For Apple, China is an extremely important market: in the last financial year, the group did 17-percent of its business there. However, the Greater China business region also includes Hong Kong and Taiwan. In Hong Kong in particular, turnover had recently fallen because the ongoing protest campaigns had frightened off paying tourists.\nIt is the second time in over a year that Apple has to take back a sales forecast- last time it was for the Christmas Quarter 2018. At the time, Apple had blamed the weakening of the Chinese economy for weaker than expected iPhone sales. In January 2019, many analysts doubted the success of the iPhone business in principle. In the Christmas Quarter 2019, however, the group was able to eliminate the concerns with record numbers.\nApple is not the only electronics provider that is affected by Coronavirus effects. In early February, Nintendo warned of bottlenecks in his game console Switch because some parts from China were scarce. (dpa",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The new Coronavirus threatens the German economy massively. The industry expects a \"stress test\" and fears \"noticeable negative effects\". Stocks are slipping into the basement.\nIn an already weakened economic situation in Germany, lung disease threatens to become a \"real economic inhibitor\", warns the Chamber of Industry and Commerce on Thursday. Already now, the internationally strongly networked German export industry is feeling that the Coronavirus is burdening global trade and companies have been holding back their investment projects in many locations.\nFederal Minister of Economy Peter Altmaier (CDU) did not rule out that the Coronavirus could have \"foreseeable effects\" on the previous growth forecasts.\n\"The spread of the Coronavirus will significantly affect the German economy this year,\" said DIHK chief of foreign economics Volker Treier. \"Production failures at Chinese and German companies in China, massive travel restrictions and trade breaks between China and Asian neighboring countries, as well as demand failures in tourism and retail are likely scenarios that can affect the economy also in Germany and Europe.\"\nAltmeier said the Ministry of Economic Affairs was determined to act calmly and calmly. He does not expect large-scale supply bottlenecks. However, uncertainty in the economy had increased. Altmaier envisioned a counter-tax from the Federal Government in the event of a massive expansion of the Coronavirus affecting the economy.\nGerman and other foreign companies operating in China are already struggling. The German and European Chambers of Commerce in China concluded that the overall impact is bad following a survey among member companies. Almost 90-percent reported \"moderate to severe effects\" due to lung diseasYeah. \"Everyone is affected,\" says the chairman of the German Chamber of Commerce in North China, Stephan Wollenstein, in Beijing.\nEach second company would have to correct the business objectives for the year. Thus, almost half of the companies expect a two-digit percentage drop in revenue in the first half of the year. A quarter even expects more than 20 percent decline. A good third already have problems with their finances today. \"People do not make money by selling something, but have to pay rent and wages at the same time,\" said Wollenstein.\nIt is precisely small and medium-sized enterprises that are suffering from lung disease. \"Some of them already have to fight to hold on,\" said the head of the European Chamber of Commerce, Jurg Wuttke. The crisis could last longer than expected, as the head of the expert commission of the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, said. He expects the epidemic in China to be \"largely under control by the end of April\".\nUnfortunately, the virus is still spreading in Europe. The fear is that, as in Beijing, the international car fair will now be cancelled in Geneva, for example, in April. The otherwise travelled Germans are uncertain, hesitating with their holiday plans. \"The longer the crisis persists, the more the travel industry will be affected,\" said Norbert Fiebig, president of the DRV branch association in Frankfurt.\n\"The uncertainty about the effects of the virus is great,\" said BDI chief manager Joachim Lang in Berlin. China is the largest German trading partner. Now, economic crisis management by the federal government is also required. \"The effects of the virus are clearly visible in the global economy and the export-oriented German industry.\" The Chinese companies worked under pressure to reduce dependencies and minimise concentration risksYeah.\nThe immediate challenges for companies in China are, first of all, unpredictable regulations, quarantine requirements and extensive conditions for restarting operations after the extended break since the Chinese New Year's Festival. \"The patchwork of conflicting regulations that the fight against Covid-19 has produced hundreds of different areas of power that make it almost impossible to move goods or people in China,\" said EU Chamber President Wuttke.\n\"China is facing a delicate balancing act with two important but divergent objectives: to rigorously maintain measures to prevent the virus while fighting for a return to economic normality,\" said contraart Wollenstein. China's government should support particularly small and medium-sized enterprises until business returns to normal.\nMore than half of the companies are complaining of a contraction in demand. \"The market stalled,\" said Wollenstein. For example, according to the Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the car market in China decreased by 20 percent in January compared to the previous month. This is also due to the fact that there were fewer sales days due to the New Year's Eve, said VDA President Hildegard Muller.\nMoreover, according to Wollenstein, due to the interruption of logistics delivery deadlines could not be met (47 percent). Many companies lack staff (47 per cent). Production is also delayed due to lack of deliveries (45 percent). Due to the uncertainties, business or investment decisions were difficult to make (44 percent).\nIf the trade war between the US and China was already a \"wake-up call\" to reduce dependencies, the viral crisis from the perspective of EU Chamber President Wuttke underlines the need to \"diversify supply chainsYeah. This could happen in other countries in Asia, but also within China. In view of the enormous size of the second largest economy, Wuttke stressed: \"Leaving China is not an option.\" For example, a million-dollar city like Shenzhen in South China has a similar economic performance to Israel. \"There is no second China. It's that simple.\"(dpa",

What is your prognosis for 2020?\nFelbermayr: Much depends, of course, on how the Corona story\nout. Every week that this goes on, it makes it more likely that we\na recession coming. The rule of thumb applies: at around 50 working weeks in the\nA year costs a week of complete failure of all employees and\nEmployees approximately one fifth, i.e. two percent, economic performance\nseen per year. At this point, of course, we are not and that is a complete\nunlikely scenario. Of course, it is also possible to produce\ncatch up, but not everything.

Kodama Takashi is one of the first countries in Japan to use the term \"corona shock\" in an economy adversely affected by the spread of the virus.\nIn China, this has become a center of pollution, peaking around February 10. But it has taken very strict quarantine measures, so the infection rate has dropped relatively fast.\n\"If these measures taken by other countries are successful at present, they may not be as fast as China, but it is hoped that the growth of diseases will decline.\" On February 16, in addition to China, there were more than 100 new cases in the world. If the peak is calculated like China's, it will happen in the world by the end of March. I don't think it's going to happen very soon, but in the optimistic scenario, it's likely to peak in mid April and then start to decline. About\nIf the situation is not under control for six months or more, it will be even worse. Tourism, public catering, entertainment and other services will and have been hit for the first time. Demand for cars and other non expendable goods is likely to decline sharply. Demand for health goods will increase, but under favourable conditions it will be a very small sector.\nHowever, he believes that once there is an improvement on the front line in the fight against the Colorado virus, the situation may change.\n\"The volatility experienced by the stock market and foreign exchange market is too fast, but this does not mean that this negative situation will last for a long time. Once there are signs that the Colorado virus is spreading less, the market will calm down relatively quickly. This will avert the economic crisis of 2008. The most important thing is the time it takes to defeat the virus, \"Kodama gossi believes.\nIn his view, at present, national efforts should not focus on measures to maintain the economy, because the extent of the damage is not clear, How to defeat the virus quickly is the basic condition of economic recovery.\nAn update on covid-19 in Russia and around the world can be found on the stakoronavirus website",

It's short-term. In the long run, economic paralysis will affect the whole world.

About\nThis trend will also be acceptable after other countries gradually emerge from the crisis: there will be few overseas tourists around the world.\nGalliado believes that Europe's troubles will last until mid May, but that doesn't mean people will start travelling immediately. \"\nThis means that people start working from now on. Now, many companies in Spain, for example, companies that stop activities, do not fire their employees, but let them go on vacation.

And my blood group holders are less likely to be infected than others. Experts published their research reports in medrxiv Electronic Science Library.\n\"For the first time, we found a link between blood groups and the risk of coronavirus infection. In particular, the second blood group (a) increases the risk of infection, while the first blood group (o) is less likely to be infected by the virus. If our data are confirmed, these characteristics of virus should be considered in medical practice. \"\nExperts in medicine and Biology (Wuhan University, China) and their colleagues at Shenzhen South University of science and technology are interested in whether there are other risk factors, In addition to age, lung injury, chronic disease and compromised immunity.\nThey drew attention to the fact that many viruses, including hepatitis B, Norfolk virus and some other pathogens, attack fourth blood group vectors much more frequently than others. And the pathogen of SARS, SARS, rarely enters the body of the first blood group carrier)About\nBased on this idea, the researchers determined the proportion of different blood types among ordinary residents in Wuhan. It turns out that there are nearly 4000 people in the monitoring group One third of the population belongs to category I, another third to category II, a quarter to category III and the remaining 9.1 per cent to category IV.\nBlood and virus\nIn the second part of the study, the scientists studied the same proportion of people suffering from covid-19 in a large hospital in Wuhan, 200 of whom have died. It has been proved that the proportion of the second type of patients is higher than that of the healthy population, 37.8% and 32.2% respectively. However, in the first group of owners, the opposite is true, their proportion is lower, 25.8% of patients and 33.8% of healthy people.\nTherefore, the proportion of patients with the first blood group is much lower, and the proportion of patients with the second blood group is much higher.\nIn order to check these proportions, scholars also investigated 398 patients' information in two other hospitals (Wuhan and Shenzhen). The hypothesis confirms that people with blood group 2 are more likely to be infected with coronavirus than other blood groups.\nWhat makes the second blood group carrier vulnerable to virus attack? Doctors can't say for the time beinAbout The researchers hope that a follow-up analysis of the data collected during the AIDS peak in Wuhan and other cities in China will help them find out.\nRussian federation\nThere are now more than 182000 people registered around the world. It is estimated that the number of new cases of coronavirus infection in 2001 was about 71000. The incidence and incidence of these diseases are increasing. Human beings. Outside China, the disease has been found in 155 countries, including Russia.\nAt the end of December, a new coronavirus (covid-19) broke out in Wuhan, China. In early March, the World Health Organization recognized the spread of the disease around the world, calling covid-19 a pandemic.\nThe new type of coronavirus belongs to the same kind of virus as SARS and mers, i.e. SARS and the Middle East mycoplasma. In the past decade, these two viruses have claimed hundreds of lives in the Middle East and East Asia and have repeatedly caused epidemics, Spread through camels and poultry.

        "news_content_translate_en": "The spread of covid-19 has reversed the habits of life around the world. Experts cannot say for sure when the epidemic begins to decline, especially when it ends. For the international community as a whole, the main hope remains to provide a Colorado virus vaccine.\nAccording to news reports, American modern biotechnology companies have made progress on this issue. It worked with the National Institutes of health to develop a vaccine prototype called mrna-1273. Human drug trials began in Seattle at the Kaiser Permanent Washington Health Research Institute) in Washington state. In addition, inovio pharmaceuticals is developing its drugs, according to the associated press. Its trials are expected to begin in April in the US, China and South Korea.\nExclusive access\nDespite the success of American experts, the Die Welt newspaper reported earlier this week that, U.S. President Donald Tampa's government has proposed a large \"exclusive license for a possible Colorado virus vaccine from the German company curevac\".\nLast week, Daniel menekela, general manager of curevac, was in the White House with representatives of other pharmaceutical companiesAbout The meeting discussed the issue of Colorado virus vaccines and with irregular organizations, vice president Mike Pence and members of the president's disease control team. As the company's press release points out, meningitis tells U.S. officials that experimental drugs will begin to be ready in the summer.\nAccording to welt, Washington called on cuevac to move its research team to the United States to develop vaccines only for the United States. \" The German Ministry of health confirmed the attempt by the US authorities to take over the company.\nThe news caused outrage among German politicians, who asked Berlin to do everything possible to stop Washington's plans. \"This article is not true,\" U.S. ambassador to Germany Richard Greiner wrote on twitter Another US official said the news was \"greatly exaggerated\" and rejected the possibility that any public vaccine could only be used in the US. Curevac itself denies any rumours of absorption.\n\"All efforts are aimed at developing a Colorado virus vaccine to help and protect people and patients around the world.\" It was later learned that the activities of cuevac would be funded by the European CommissioAbout\nGlobal efforts\nAfter Chinese experts were able to isolate the genetic code of the virus, countries around the world began to develop vaccines. Researchers from the European Union, the United States, Australia, Israel, China, Japan and Russia are trying to find a way to fight covid-19. About 35 companies and academic institutions are developing drugs. Four of them have started animal experiments. Recently, clinical research has been allowed in China. It has previously been reported that eight new coronavirus vaccines have been developed in the country, some of which have been successfully tested in transgenic mice and mccack.\nThe search for a vaccine itself is a complex and low-level process. It follows the same principle: scientists try to create something similar, but not as dangerous as pathogens. He then contacts the body's immune system through vaccination. Ideally, the machine remembers an exciter. Under the influence of the new virus, the human body began to react before the infection. However, some experts fear that this balance could be undermined in a rush to vaccinate. This may lead to the deterioration of the disease. According to Reuters, studies have shown that coronavirus drugs have a development risk of so-called antibody dependent infection aggravating syndrome. About This refers to a process in which the disease does not recede after the use of the vaccine, on the contrary, the disease is aggravating.\nIf it is a sudden outbreak, as now, the vaccine problem is more complicated. The virus may appear and disappear in a few months, with rapid changes in transmission. So while watching countries try to find vaccines at the same time, it's more accurately lottery rather than competition. Each team has its own ticket, and whether it will win depends not so much on speed or skill as on the coincidence of success. It's worth remembering that the more teams in the game, the greater the chance of success. From a commercial point of view, the development of vaccines is a dangerous undertaking. It's important to know that only a few candidates can achieve clinical trials.\nVaccination time\nEven if the drug is now available, it will take at least a year and a half of testing before it can be delivered to ordinary consumers. Who says at least 18 months. Once the vaccine is considered effective, mass production is needed. Most organizations trying to win covid-19 don't have the ability at all.\nThese companies intend to support the global innovation alliance to prevent epidemics, CEPIAbout The international organization is ready to invest in vaccine development and increase production at the same time. Recently, she said $2 billion is needed to support drug development. Without that money, the vaccine development program would not be fully implemented, according to Richard Hackett, CEPI's executive director.\nHowever, the obstacles are not over. Another challenge is to provide vaccines to all who need them. In general, the epidemic has the greatest impact on the poorest countries. It's just that they don't have the money to build an effective health care system. This also affects vaccine procurement opportunities. For example, during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the wealthiest countries bought most of their medicines, while the poor countries had nothing. There is another possibility. India, for example, which is a major supplier of vaccines to developing countries, has decided first to use its productive capacity to protect populations under one year of age. Three billion dollars, and then exports drugs to others. This situation can fully explain why the U.S. authorities are willing to get vaccines at all costs.\nIn this regard, who can bring together governments, philanthropic foundations and vaccine manufacturers to agree on a global equitable distribution strategyAbout However, the epidemic is different, in which case no country is obliged to comply with any international regulations. As Jonathan Kwik, a health expert at Duke University in North Carolina, points out, politics and economics are likely to hinder immunization. \"\nWilder Smith, a new infectious disease professor at the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine, believes the epidemic is likely to peak and fall to its current level. \"How to get a vaccine.\" In this case, drugs can still save many lives, especially if the virus circulates like flu and there are new seasonal outbreaks.\nBut before vaccine production begins, the disease must be controlled as much as possible. Therefore, as long as scientists work in the laboratory, the rest of the best stay at home and wash their hands.\nDmitry beliaye",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Usuarios de Facebook han estado compartiendo publicaciones que aseguran que las redes 5G, no el coronavirus, están enfermando a las personas.\nLas publicaciones incluyen una lista de otras afirmaciones que niegan la realidad del virus y mencionan varios argumentos de tipo conspirativo sobre el virus.\nEl brote de coronavirus comenzó en diciembre de 2019 en Wuhan, China. Los Centros para el Control y Prevención de Enfermedades dicen en su sitio en Internet que el virus está ligado a un \"mercado de mariscos y animales vivos\" donde los humanos podrían haber contraído el virus de un animal. El virus luego se propagó persona a persona.(  here  )\nLos síntomas de la enfermedad COVID-19 incluyen fiebre, cansancio, tos y dificultades para respirar que pueden aparecer entre dos a 14 días después de la exposición al virus(  here  ). La propagación del coronavirus se da persona a persona.(  here  )\nLos teléfonos móviles usan ondas de radio. Ellos envían y reciben campos electromagnéticos de radiofrecuencia (CEM RF). El 5G utiliza una \"tecnología de conformación de haces\", que permite que los campos electromagnéticos de radiofrecuencia vayan directamente donde se necesita (  here  ).\nLa Comisión Internacional sobre Protección Frente a Radiaciones No Ionizantes (ICNIRP, por su sigla en inglés) publicó en 2020 normas para limitar la exposición a campos electromagnéticos, después de siete años de investigación. Ellas incluyen información sobre las redes 5G.\nLa comisión dice que el principal efecto que los campos electromagnéticos de radiofrecuencia tienen en el cuerpo humano es una mayor temperatura del tejido expuesto. El cuerpo puede manejar pequeños aumentos de la temperatura corporal, como durante el ejercicio, pero la exposición a radiofrecuencia y la mayor temperatura pueden ser peligrosas sobre cierto umbral (  here  ).\nSegún la ICNIRP, \"otra característica general de los CEM RF es que mientras mayor sea la frecuencia, menor es la profundidad de penetración de los EMFs en el cuerpo. Como las tecnologías 5G puede utilizar mayores frecuencias de CEM (>24 GHz) además de las usadas actualmente (<4 GHz), el poder de esas mayores frecuencias será absorbido principalmente a un nivel más superficial que el de las tecnologías de telecomunicaciones previas (...) Por ende, la exposición al 5G no causará ningún daño siempre y cuando se adhiera a las normas de la ICNIRP (2020)\" (  here  ).\nEric van Rongen, presidente de ICNIRP, dijo en un video que no hay evidencia de que los campos electromagnéticos causen efectos en la salud como el cáncer, la electrohipersensibilidad, la infertilidad o alguna otra cosa. Los únicos dos efectos reconocidos en la salud son la estimulación nerviosa sobre los 10 MHz y el calor desde los 100 kHz (  here  ).\nLa Organización Mundial de la Salud dice que ninguna investigación ha asociado la exposición a la tecnología inalámbrica con efectos negativos para la salud (  here  ). La OMS afirma en su sitio en Internet que seguirá revisando investigaciones en esta área y realizando \"evaluaciones al riesgo para la salud\" de todos los rangos de radiofrecuencia que estarán disponibles en 2022.\nMarvin C. Ziskin, profesor emérito de Radiología y Física Médica, dijo que no hay fundamentos para esperar que la red 5G provoque condiciones adversas de salud, siempre y cuando se respeten los límites de exposición.\nZiskin dijo a Reuters, “El peso de la evidencia científica indica que las emisiones 5G no son acumulativas. Eso significa que múltiples exposiciones inocuas no se suman para producir un efecto biológico adverso. Agregaría que no ha habido advertencias de agencias sanitarias sobre posibles riesgos a la salud de la energía de RF, incluidas ondas milimétricas a los niveles de exposición que un consumidor promedio experimentaría de la tecnología de comunicaciones. Esto es consistente con la evaluación del tema realizada por grupos que establecen estándares como el IEEE y el ICNIRP”, refiriéndose al Instituto de Ingeniería Eléctrica y Electrónica.\nLos síntomas del coronavirus se pueden hallar en detalle en sitios oficiales de gobiernos y de organizaciones sanitarias internacionales. No tienen ninguna similitud con los posibles efectos en la salud derivados del uso de teléfonos móviles o las redes 5G.\nFalso: No hay relación entre el brote de COVID-19 y los posibles efectos de las redes 5G en la salud.\nEste artículo fue realizado por el equipo Reuters Fact Check.

The post claims that 17 states, as well as the District of Columbia, are in a state of emergency: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah, Washington. The map also has 15 \"COVID-19 camps\" marked in Seattle, Washington; Fairfield, Riverside and San Diego, California; Fort Carson, Colorado; Omaha, Nebraska; Honolulu, Hawaii; Dallas and San Antonio, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Newark, New Jersey, New York, New York, Detroit, Michigan; and the District of Columbia. The information in this post is partly false. ​\nAs of March 11, 2020, 20 states and the District of Columbia are in state of emergency due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Those states are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah, and Washington (  here  ). On Wednesday, March 11, 2020, Mayor Muriel Bowser declared (  here  ) both a state of emergency and a public health emergency in the District of Columbia.​\nFive states that are currently in a state of emergency - Arizona (  here  ), Illinois (  here  ), ​\nIowa (  here  ), Louisiana (  here  ), and ​\nMichigan (  here  ) - are not designated as such on this map.​ It may be that this map was designed prior to these states declaring emergencies.\nHowever, three states who have not, as of March 13, 2020 declared an emergency - Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island – are incorrectly marked on the map. (The latest updates on COVID-19 in Ohio can be found  here  . Updates for Pennsylvania can be found  here  and updates for Rhode Island can be found   here  .)​\nThe map’s designation of “COVID-19 camps,” likely a reference to sites of quarantine, is inaccurate in parts. ​While some of these cities have been used for quarantines, others have not, as of March 12, 2020.\nCALIFORNIA – true\nThe marker on Fairfield, California may refer to Travis Air Force Base, where, as   here  , passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship (  here  ), were quarantined.\nThe marker on Riverside, California may refer to March Air Reserve Base, where 195 Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China were released from quarantine on February 11, 2020 (  here  ).\nThe marker on San Diego, Calif., may refer to ​Miramar Marine Corps Air Station, where hundreds of passengers from the Grand Princess cruise ship (not to be confused with the Diamond Princess cruise ship) are being quarantined (  here  ​).\nCOLORADO – partly false\nThe marker in central Colorado is on Fort Carson, approved for possible use by Defense Secretary Mark Esper in early February (  here  ). As of March 12, 2020, there was no evidence of the site having been needed as a coronavirus quarantine site.\nGEORGIA – true\nThe marker on Atlanta may refer to Dobbins Air Reserve Base in nearby Marietta, Ga. As reported (  here  ) by the Atlanta Journal Constitution, quarantined passengers from the Grand Princess began arriving at the base on March 11, 2020.\nHAWAII – partly false\nThe marker on Honolulu may refer to a CDC quarantine station located there (  here  ). As of March 12, 2020, there are no reports of it being used to quarantine coronavirus patients.\nILLINOIS – partly false\nThe marker on Chicago may refer to Great Lakes Training Center Navy Base near Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The base is one of the military installations near 11 major airports identified by the Pentagon as a potential quarantine site, but has not yet been used as one (  here  ).\nMICHIGAN – partly false\nThe marker on Detroit may refer to Fort Custer Training Center, another potential quarantine site chosen by the Pentagon, near Detroit Metropolitan Airport (  here  ). The training center has not yet been used as a coronavirus quarantine site.\nNEBRASKA – true\nThe marker on Omaha may refer to the University of Nebraska Medical Center, where 13 evacuees from the Diamond Princess cruise ship were treated in February 2020, according to NPR (  here  ). The University of Nebraska Medical Center is not designated a potential quarantine site.\nNEW JERSEY – partly false\nThe marker on Newark may refer to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s general quarantine station (  here  ) or the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, another military installation identified by the Pentagon as a potential coronavirus quarantine site, near Newark Liberty International Airport (  here  ). Neither of these places have yet been used to quarantine people infected with coronavirus.\nNEW YORK – true\nThe marker on New York City may refer to New Rochelle, a suburb 25 miles north of the city that became a local epicenter of the virus. Now designated a “containment area,” Governor Andrew Cuomo, according to Reuters (  here  ), announced on March 10, 2020 that he was calling in the National Guard to help clean public spaces and to deliver food to residents.\nTEXAS – partly false\nIn addition to the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station, Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas is also a quarantine site for passengers from the Grand Princess (  here  ), and was a site of the now lifted quarantine of passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship (  here  ).\nThe marker on Dallas, Texas may refer to the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base near Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. This base was among the military installations near 11 major airports identified by the Pentagon, at the request of the Department of Health and Human Services, for coronavirus quarantine for Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China in early February 2020 (  here  ). However, those with potential exposure to the virus did not end up quarantined there.\nWASHINGTON – true\nThe marker on Seattle may refer to Naval Base Kitsap, another military installation identified by the Pentagon for potential coronavirus quarantine (  here  ). The site of the first known U.S. coronavirus on January 21, 2020 (  here  ), Washington State has the highest number of cases in the country, with New York not far behind (  here  ). Naval Base Kitsap has not yet been used as a coronavirus quarantine site, but people have been quarantined in Washington given the elevated number of cases.\nTHE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA – partly false\nThough Mayor ​Bowser declared (  here  ) both a state of emergency and a public health emergency in the nation’s capital, residents of Washington, D.C. have so far only been asked to self-quarantine (  here  ). There is not yet a designated quarantine or containment zone in the District of Columbia as of March 12, 2020.\nPartly false: This map does not accurately show states that have declared a state of emergency due to the outbreak of coronavirus. It is unclear what “COVID-19 camps” are, but Reuters determined that if referring to quarantine facilities, these markers ranged from true to partly false. Several locations had quarantine facilities in place, but they had not been used as accommodation for people requiring isolation due to COVID-19 exposure.\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

        "news_content_translate_en": "GENEVA/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The United States could become the global epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday, as India announced a full 24-hour, nationwide lockdown in the world’s second-most populous country.\nIndia joined the ranks of Britain and other countries clamping down to hold back the virus as business activity collapsed from Japan to the United States at a record pace in March.\nThe highly contagious coronavirus has caused entire regions to be placed on lockdown. In some places soldiers are patrolling the streets to keep consumers and workers indoors, halting services and production and breaking supply chains.\n“The global health crisis is rapidly morphing into a global recession, as there is a clear tension between preventing infections and ruining the economy,” said Edoardo Campanella, an economist at UniCredit Bank in Milan.\nBut Wall Street bounced from three-year lows as investors pin their hopes on the U.S. Senate passing a $2 trillion stimulus bill.\nConfirmed coronavirus cases around the world exceeded 377,000 across 194 countries and territories as of early Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, more than 16,500 of them fatal.\nIn Geneva, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said infections in the United States had greatly increased.\nOver the previous 24 hours, 85 percent of new cases were in Europe and the United States, and of those, 40 percent were in the United States.\nAs of Monday, the virus had infected more than 42,000 people there, killing at least 559.\nAsked whether the United States could become the new epicenter, Harris said: “We are now seeing a very large acceleration in cases in the U.S. So it does have that potential.”\nSome U.S. state and local officials have decried a lack of coordinated federal action, saying that having localities act on their own has put them in competition for supplies.\nPresident Donald Trump acknowledged the difficulty.\n“The World market for face masks and ventilators is Crazy. We are helping the states to get equipment, but it is not easy,” he tweeted.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday the government would impose a nationwide lockdown from midnight for 21 days.\nHealth researchers have warned that more than a million people in India could be infected with the coronavirus by mid-May, prompting the government to shut down all air and train travel, businesses and schools.\nOn Tuesday, Modi, leader of the world’s biggest democracy, went further, saying nobody would be allowed to leave their homes.\n“The only way to save ourselves from coronavirus is if we don’t leave our homes, whatever happens, we stay at home,” Modi said.\nIndia has so far reported 482 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and nine deaths.\nOlympic Games organizers and the Japanese government had clung to the hope that the world’s biggest sporting event could go ahead, but finally bowed to the inevitable to make Tokyo 2020 the latest and biggest victim of a ravaged sporting calendar.\nAfter a call with International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach, Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the July 24-Aug. 9 event would be rescheduled for the summer of 2021 at the latest - as proof of victory over the coronavirus.\n“President Bach said he is in agreement, 100%.”\nIt was the first time in the Olympics’ 124-year history that they had been postponed, though they were canceled outright three times during the two 20th-century world wars.\nOf the top 10 countries by case numbers, Italy has reported the highest fatality rate, at around 10%, which at least partly reflects its older population. The fatality rate globally - the ratio of deaths to confirmed infections - is around 4.3%, though national figures can vary widely according to how much testing is done.\nBritain, believed by experts to be about two weeks behind Italy in the outbreak cycle, on Tuesday began curbs on movement without precedent in peacetime after Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered the country to stay at home.\nThe streets of the capital were quiet as all but essential shops closed and people only went to work if it was unavoidable.\nJohnson had resisted pressure to impose a full lockdown even as other European countries had done so, but was forced to change tack as projections showed the health system could become overwhelmed.\nMeanwhile China’s Hubei province, the original center of the outbreak, will lift curbs on people leaving the area, but other regions will tighten controls as new cases double due to imported infections.\nThe provincial capital Wuhan, which has been in total lockdown since Jan. 23, will lift its travel restrictions on April 8.\nHowever, the risk from overseas infections appears to be on the rise, prompting tougher screening and quarantine measures in  cities such as the capital Beijing.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has a significant deficit in hospital beds, medical staff and intensive care facilities as health experts warn that it is primed to become a new epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data reviewed by Reuters.\nHealth experts say Indonesia faces a surge in coronavirus cases after a slow government response masked the scale of the outbreak in the world’s fourth most populous country.\nIndonesia has recorded 686 cases but the data is seen as understating the scale of infections because of a low rate of testing and a high mortality rate. Indonesia has reported 55 deaths, the highest in Southeast Asia.\nA study by the London-based Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases released on Monday estimates that as few as 2% of Indonesia’s coronavirus infections have been reported. That would bring the true number to as many as 34,300, which is more than Iran.\nOther modellers are projecting that cases could rise to as many as 5 million in the capital, Jakarta, by the end of April under a worst-case scenario.\n“We have lost control, it has already spread everywhere,” Ascobat Gani, a public health economist told Reuters. “Maybe we will follow Wuhan or Italy. I think we are in the range of that”.\nThe government says the impact of the virus will not be that severe.\n“We won’t be like that,” said Achmad Yurianto, a senior health ministry official, referring to comparisons with outbreaks in Italy and China.\n“What’s important is that we rally the people ... they have to keep their distance.”\nIndonesia’s health system compares poorly with those in other countries hit hard by the virus.\nThe country of more than 260 million people has 321,544 hospital beds, according to health ministry data. That is about 12 beds per 10,000 people. South Korea has 115 per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nIn 2017, the WHO found Indonesia had four doctors per 10,000 people. Italy had 10 times more, on a per capita basis. South Korea has six times more doctors.\nYurianto said with proper social distancing measures there should not be a need for a large number of additional beds and that medical staffing was sufficient to tackle the virus.\nHowever, Budi Haryanto, an epidemiologist from the University of Indonesia, told Reuters: “The hospitals are not ready to support the potential cases. Treatment will be limited.”\nAlthough only hundreds of people have been hospitalised for coronavirus, doctors told Reuters the health system was already under strain. Many health staff lack protective equipment, with one doctor telling Reuters how she had to wear a raincoat because there were no coveralls available.\nIn a sign of poor infection controls in hospitals and clinics, eight doctors and one nurse have died from the  coronavirus, according to the Indonesian Doctors Association.\nIn Italy, where there have been 6,077 coronavirus deaths, 23 doctors have died.\nStaff at one hospital on the outskirts of Jakarta had threatened not to come to work on Tuesday because of a lack of protective equipment, another doctor told Reuters.\n“We bring our own masks, our own suits that may not be of standard quality,” the doctor told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n“My friends, one by one, catch the virus,” he said, holding back tears.\nThe government said this week it had sourced 175,000 new sets of protective equipment for medical staff that would be distributed across the country.\nA new emergency hospital has been opened in Jakarta with an eventual capacity to treat up to 24,000 patients. Doctors and medical staff have been promised bonuses and 500,000 rapid testing kits have arrived from China.\nIndonesia’s health system is highly decentralised, making it hard for the central government to coordinate its response across a sprawling archipelago of some 19,000 islands spanning 5,100 km.\nA lack of intensive care unit (ICU) beds also worries experts, especially as the country enters peak dengue fever season, which adds to demand for the facilities.\n“If you are critically ill and you can get into ICU and get put on a ventilator, most people should survive,” said Archie Clements, a public health specialist from Perth’s Curtin University, referring to people infected with the coronavirus.\n“If you don’t get them into ICU and get them on a ventilator, then they will die.”\nA study in the Critical Care Medicine journal in January, which compared intensive care beds for adults in Asian countries using 2017 data, found Indonesia had 2.7 critical care beds per 100,000 people, among the lowest in the region.\n(This story corrects name of Budi Haryanto in paragraph 14)\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese scientists and health experts involved in the country’s fight against the coronavirus believe the worst is now over, downplaying warnings that the disease could become seasonal or that a deadlier “second wave” could hit later in the year.\nAs the pandemic continues to spread overseas, a growing number of countries are bracing themselves for a worst-case scenario in which COVID-19 remains in circulation until next year at the earliest.\nBut medical advisers in China have expressed confidence that the country’s strict containment measures have done enough to ensure that the outbreak can be brought under complete control, domestically at least, within weeks.\nThough they remain wary of the risks of “importing” cases from overseas, they say China should be capable of eliminating COVID-19 in the same way it eliminated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. SARS was eventually contained after the government imposed stringent screening and quarantine measures.\n“For me, a second outbreak (of coronavirus), a domestic outbreak in China, wouldn’t be a great concern,” said Cao Wei, deputy director of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital.\nShe told a briefing on Monday that while China needed another month to make a final judgment, the existing prevention and control measures should be enough to bring the epidemic to an end domestically.\nThe World Health Organization has said the coronavirus reached a peak in China around late February. Zhong Nanshan, a senior government adviser who helped detect and defeat SARS in 2003, said it “could be over by June” if other countries take the required action.\nOn Wednesday, there were no new domestic cases in the disease’s epicenter of Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began. However, “imported” infections reached a record 34, and have outnumbered domestic transmissions for five consecutive days.\nIan Henderson, director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at the University of Queensland, said China’s actions to contain the virus have been “extraordinary” but there could be a second outbreak, this time imported.\n“(What) remains possible is that as controls around isolation are relaxed in China, with a population that is still susceptible, then the virus may resurge if it has not been eradicated elsewhere,” he said.\nGao Zhengliang, vice-director of the China Cell Biology Institute told the official Youth Daily newspaper that the country had now completed “99 out of 100 steps” required to defeat the coronavirus, though he warned that if global infections spiraled out of control, “the costs and sacrifices China has made will be downgraded.”\nSome experts have referred to the infection patterns of the devastating 1918-19 influenza epidemic that killed more than 50 million people during three different waves, with the second the deadliest. However, Henderson said it was important to recognize the current virus was different from influenza.\nGlobal inter-connectedness means that instead of coming in waves, new viruses are now more likely to spread and circulate until they mutate or until a certain level of immunity is reached. One crucial issue is how long a previously infected patient remains immune.\n“The number one point to get across is that in terms of the behavior of this virus we are still very much in the dark,” Henderson said. “The issue around protective immunity is difficult to answer because we simply do not have sufficient information.”\nSome experts have raised the possibility that COVID-19 could become an entrenched seasonal illness along with ordinary influenza.\nPreliminary studies have shown a possible correlation between the epidemic and climate patterns. A paper produced by researchers in Europe this week said the coronavirus preferred cool and dry conditions which could lead to seasonal global outbreaks “much like other respiratory diseases”.\nHowever, there have still been cases in warmer and more humid climates in southeast Asian countries, including Thailand and Singapore.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has been one of many to suggest that COVID-19 could go away of its own accord as temperatures rise in the northern hemisphere.\nHowever, Marc Lipsitch, a communicable disease expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said while warmer and wetter weather could reduce the contagiousness of the coronavirus, “it is not reasonable to expect those declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent.”\nGao of the China Cell Biology Institute said given the higher fatality rate for the coronavirus, relaxing curbs was not an option.\n“The resolute curbs on the coronavirus must be continued, it absolutely cannot be allowed to co-exist with humans in the same way as the influenza virus.”\n",

The future of this pandemic to a greater extent will be determined by what happens with very large, densely populated countries,” Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s emergencies program, said.\n“So it’s really, really important that India continues to take aggressive action at the public health level and at the level of society to contain, control and suppress this disease.”\nThe Indian government said essential services including groceries, fuel stations and banks will remain open. The stock market, located in the financial capital Mumbai, will also operate on Wednesday.\nBut ahead of the shutdown starting midnight, people in Delhi and Mumbai were rushing to shops to stock up essentials and in some areas police were deployed to main order.\nModi said the government was working to reduce the difficulties for the poor who will be the hardest hit by the shuttering down of Asia’s third largest economy. But he did not provide any details.\nHe urged people not to crowd around shops and said there was enough stocks.\n“It is a decisive decision - a difficult one, but probably the right one,” said Partha Chatterjee, professor of economics at Shiv Nadar University near New Delhi.\n“The first priority is to save lives and then think of reconstruction.”\nAcross South Asia, home to a quarter of the world’s population, authorities are scrambling to raise their defenses as the virus spreads.\nFour NATO service members in Afghanistan tested positive for coronavirus shortly after entering the country, the first confirmed cases in the mission, NATO said in a statement.\n“The service members were newly arrived in country, and were in a precautionary screening facility when they became symptomatic, were moved to isolation and were tested,” the statement said.\nAround 1,500 NATO service members, most of whom had recently arrived in Afghanistan, were in screening facilities as a precautionary measure, NATO said.\nAfghanistan’s health ministry said that WHO had estimated that 80 percent of the war ravaged country’s 32 million population could be infected with the virus in the next five months. So far it has had 74 cases and one death.\nInvoking a 56-year-old law, Nepal also ordered a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the virus after reporting a second case in the Himalayan nation of 30 million people.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - An old malaria treatment that has been tried with some success against the new coronavirus and was touted by U.S. President Donald Trump at a news briefing earlier on Thursday is in short supply as demand surges amid the fast-spreading outbreak.\nThe American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), which maintains a list of drugs in shortage independent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s list, added the generic malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to its list on Thursday. Four out of eight manufacturers of the drug are currently in shortage, it said.\nThe new coronavirus, which causes the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness, emerged in December in Wuhan, China and has spread throughout the world.\nThere are currently no vaccines or treatments approved for the disease, but researchers are studying existing treatments and working on experimental ones. At the moment, most patients can only receive supportive care.\nErin Fox, senior director of drug information at University of Utah Health, who maintains ASHP’s shortages list, said pharmacists are unable to get the drug or fill prescriptions in full.\nFox said that University of Utah’s 12 retail pharmacies are not filling prescriptions for prophylactic use, and are preserving their stocks for inpatient needs.\nThe FDA could not be reached for comment, but hydroxychloroquine is not currently on its drugs in shortage list.\nTrump called on U.S. health regulators to expedite potential therapies aimed at treating COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine.\n“We’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately,” Trump said of the malaria drug at a White House briefing.\nFox and the FDA have been watching for drug shortages that could be due to supply chain issues with manufacturing in China and India. But surging demand in recent weeks is the issue with the malaria drug, which can also treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, according to online pharmacy, Honeybee Health.\nIts co-Chief Executive Jessica Nouhavandi sent a letter to prescribers earlier this week, urging them to be aware of potential hoarding of the drug that could deprives those who really need it.\nOn Thursday, Nouhavandi said demand was its highest yet after Trump’s comments.\nJeff Bartone, who owns Hock’s Pharmacy in Vandalia, Ohio, said he purchased five bottles of hydroxychloroquine this morning, but within an hour the company that distributes it to his pharmacy had run out.\nHe said four backup prescription drug wholesalers were out of the drug as well.\nBartone said he does not typically stock large amounts of the drug because it is not widely prescribed.\nMylan NV (MYL.O) - one of the manufacturers ASHP said was in shortage - said it was ramping up production of the drug and expects to be in a position to begin supplying it more broadly in mid-April.\nIt said with the raw materials on hand it can make 50 million tablets to potentially treat more than 1.5 million patients.\nBayer AG (BAYGn.DE) said it would donate 3 million tablets of Resochin - a closely related drug known generically as chloroquine phosphate. Chloroquine is also in shortage, according to the ASHP.\nOnline pharmacy Valisure said it too was unable to order any chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as of Thursday from its four distributors.\nValisure Chief Executive David Light said other potential treatments are also becoming difficult to obtain.\n“Kaletra and losartan are being rationed, meaning we are only allowed to order limited quantities at a time,” he said.\nKaletra, a combination HIV treatment sold by AbbVie ABBN.N, and the generic blood pressure drug losartan have been considered as potential treatments for the virus, although Chinese investigators reported this week that Kaletra failed to improve outcomes for seriously ill COVID-19 patients.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "\nAlmost 5,00,000 covid-19 positive cases and more than 23,000 deaths later, Beijing is now urging for an all-out global war against the pandemic that originated in its own courtyard, Wuhan, before sweeping the world, perishing men, women, children, old and derailing the economies.\nHowever, the reality is -- the world-wide toll could have been checked within time if China had been more transparent and had warned countries regarding the new strain of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-like infection, which originated at a 'wet market' in its province of Hubei late last year, as per a report published by American magazine National Review.\nThe coronavirus that jumps from an animal species to a human and has now become a deadly infection, was first identified in a patient, a resident of Wuhan in the Hubei province, on December 1, 2019.\nFive days after the onset of illness, the already infected man's 53-year-old wife who had no known history of exposure to the market was also diagnosed with pneumonia, a common symptom of the contagious infection, and was hospitalised and placed in an isolation ward.\nIt wasn't until the second week of December that the doctors in Wuhan were able find new cases that further indicated the virus was spreading from one human to another.\nOn December 25, Chinese medical staff in two hospitals in Wuhan were suspected of contracting viral pneumonia and were quarantined. Later, hospitals in Wuhan witnessed an \"exponential\" increase in the number of cases in late December that cannot be linked back to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.\nWhistleblower doctor Li Wenliang warned a group of other doctors about a possible outbreak of an illness that resembled \"severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\". He urged them to take protective measures against infection.\nOn December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission declared that their investigation has not found \"any obvious human-to-human transmission and no medical staff infection.\"\nChina contacted the World Health Organization (WHO) three weeks after doctors first started noticing the cases.\nAt the beginning of January 2020, summons were issued to Li Wenliang by the Wuhan Public Security Bureau accusing the doctor of \"spreading rumours.\"\nOn January 3, Dr Li signed a statement at a police station acknowledging his \"misdemeanour\" and promising not to commit further \"unlawful acts.\" China's National Health Commission ordered institutions not to publish any information related to the unknown disease.\nOn the same day, the Hubei Provincial Health Commission ordered to stop testing samples from Wuhan related to the new disease and destroyed all existing samples.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission released another statement, reiterating that preliminary investigations have shown \"no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission and no medical staff infections.\"\nFifty-nine people in Wuhan were sickened by a \"pneumonia-like illness\", as per a report by The New York Times published on January 6. On the same day, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued a level 1 travel watch. It advised travellers to Wuhan to avoid contact with 'living or dead animals, animal markets, and sick people.'\nOn January 8, Chinese medical authorities claimed to have identified the virus, reiterating that it still found \"no clear evidence of human-to-human transfer\".\nOn January 11, China announced its first death from the virus, a 61-year-old man who had purchased goods from the seafood market.\nOn the same day, the Wuhan City Health Commission released a Q&A sheet emphasising that most of the unexplained viral pneumonia cases in Wuhan have a history of exposure to the South China seafood market and \"no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission has been found.\"\nDr Li Wenliang was hospitalised on January 12. He started coughing and developed a fever after unknowingly treating a patient with the coronavirus. Later, Wenliang's condition deteriorated so badly that he was admitted to the intensive care unit and was given oxygen support.\nOn January 13, the first case of novel coronavirus was reported outside China involving a 61-year-old Chinese woman in Thailand, who had visited Wuhan.\nHowever, Thailand's ministry of public health said the woman had not visited the Wuhan seafood market and had come down with a fever on January 5. The woman had visited a different, smaller market in Wuhan, in which live and freshly slaughtered animals were sold.\nOn January 14, the World Health Organization in its report stated: ‘Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China.’\nOn January 15, Japan reported its first case of coronavirus and its health ministry said the patient had not visited any seafood markets in China.\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission in a statement said that the possibility of \"limited human-to-human transmission\" cannot be ruled out.\nDespite the fact that Wuhan doctors knew that the virus was \"contagious\", city authorities allowed 40,000 families to gather and share home-cooked food in a Lunar New Year banquet, as per the article in National Review.\nOn January 19, the Chinese National Health Commission declared the virus \"still preventable and controllable\".\nA day later, the head of China's national health commission team investigating the outbreak, confirmed that two cases of infection in China's Guangdong province had been caused by \"human-to-human transmission and medical staff had been infected\".\nOn January 21, the CDC announced the first case of the coronavirus in the US. The patient had returned from China six days ago.\nOn January 22, a WHO delegation conducted a field visit to Wuhan and concluded, \"deployment of the new test kit nationally suggests that human-to-human transmission is taking place in Wuhan.\"\nNearly two months after the first case of the virus was reported, Chinese authorities announced their 'first steps for a quarantine of Wuhan.' By this time, a significant number of Chinese citizens had travelled abroad as \"asymptomatic, oblivious carriers\".\nDr Wenliang tested positive for coronavirus on February 1 and died six days later.\nToday, the killer bug has spread to over 170 countries across the globe, apart from Antarctica. After inflicting its wrath in Asia, the virus has now travelled to Europe which has become the new epicentre of the disease outbreak.\nCases in Europe topped 250,000 -- more than half of which were in Spain and hard-hit Italy. Spain recorded 655 new fatalities over 24 hours, while Italy's death toll rose by 712 to hit 8,215.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "1 Fighting community transmission\nWith the number of Novel Coronavirus cases climbing steadily and reports of local transmission emerging from across the country, India is on the brink of community transmission, or Stage 3, of COVID-19. On March 24, while announcing a three-week preventive lockdown of the entire country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi allocated Rs 15,000 crore to boost the health infrastructure. The funds will be used to create additional hospital beds, build on the stockpile of COVID-19 testing kits and train medical practitioners. The Centre is putting in place protocols, including the acquisition of medical equipment and protection gear needed in the special isolation wards and facilities. A training protocol for frontline health workers is also being prepared.\nThe funds announced are a beginning. We would need more, depending on how soon we can end this affliction. Earlier, states were only using National Health Mission (NHM) funds. Now, they have access to a central fund, says Dr V.K. Paul, public health expert and a member of NITI Aayog. The first thing to do with the funds is equip hospitals, with personal protective gear, ventilators, additional oxygen, drugs and train staff. While isolation wards are being created, Dr Paul says COVID-specific facilities also need to be looked at for Stage 3. In Geneva, they are out of ICU (intensive care unit) beds. Such is the virulence of the disease at its peak. We need good hospitals that is where the focus is now. To support hospitals, we must also have isolation facilities, a strict surveillance system and should even consider setting up call centres in medical colleges, he says. Dr Paul maintains that India is still at Stage 2 (local transmission), but testing is being done more widely now.\nKerala, which has both an enduring healthcare system and a strong network of Panchayati raj bodies, is stealing a march on other states with its preparedness. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan says since a high number of people might need to be put under quarantine, local bodies have been instructed to identify hospitals, buildings, schools and auditoriums for the purpose. Even a minor lapse can prove disastrous, Vijayan cautioned office-bearers of local bodies during a video conference on March 19. If there is a spurt in cases, the existing facilities would not be enough to meet the requirements. Since the vast majority under observation would be home-quarantinedas people under special care’, Kerala’s strategy is to get the local bodies to take responsibility for local communities and ensure they do not face logistical problems while handling the situation.\n2 Dedicated COVID-19 hospitals and ICUs\nWith a hospital bed to population ratio of just 1:1,000 or around a million hospital beds in all, less than 100,000 ICU beds and only 40,000 ventilators at hand, India’s healthcare infrastructure is ill-equipped to face a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. Ventilators will be particularly critical. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in a report, said that about 5 per cent of COVID-19 patients may require intensive care, and half of those may need ventilator support.\nCOVID-19 impacts the lungs. In severe cases, the lungs fill up with fluid and it becomes hard to breathe. A ventilator ensures that the lungs do not collapse while the treatment is on, says Dr J.V. Divatia of the department of anaesthesiology, critical care and pain at Mumbai’s Tata Memorial Hospital. He warns of trouble if the patient numbers in India match those in China or Europe. There is no guideline on how many ventilators a hospital needs. In India, we keep about 20 per cent of beds for critical care, which is about enough in normal conditions, says Dr Divatia.\nMost high-end ventilators available in India are imported and cost Rs 5-12 lakh each. Hospitals say the quality of equipment made in the country isn’t as reliable. If orders are placed in advance, more ventilators can be bought and set up within a week. With little demand for their products at home, Indian manufacturers have been exporting ventilators. Ventilators manufactured by the Delhi-based Croyox Medical Service, costing Rs 4 lakh each, have been exported to Nepal, Thailand and Europe previously. Things changed on March 19 with the government’s ban on export of ventilators. It wants 100,000 simpler’ ventilators, customised for COVID-19 patients, installed across the country by April 30. Mysuru-based Skanray Technologies is being tasked to make 5,000 of these. Low-end ventilators could be an alternative if the COVID-19 symptoms are not very severe, says Dr Divatia.\nVentilator parts such as valves and sensors, though, are expected to remain in short supply. We will share the knowhow with others ready to make these customised ventilators so that the demand can be met as soon as possible, says Vishwaprasad Alva, managing director, Skanray Technologies. Experts also underscore the need to ensure adequate oxygen supplies in hospitals; many hospitals in Europe struggled to save COVID-19 patients as oxygen supplies ran out.\nAcross states, properties are being identified to transform them into dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. These could be defunct or upcoming hospitals or even hostels of educational institutions that can be converted into 250-300-bed facilities. The first such facility is a 100-bed centre set up by the Sir H.N. Reliance Foundation Hospital, Mumbai, at the 700-bed SevenHills Hospital in Andheri. Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, has pledged his Club Mahindra Resorts to serve as care centres for COVID-19 patients. He also said the group’s manufacturing units will see if they can manufacture ventilators. Hyderabad’s Owaisi Hospital and Research Centre is setting up an exclusive 100-bed centre.\nThe All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, which has about 1,300 doctors and 1,800 nurses on its rolls, has set up an isolation ward for COVID-19 cases. The institute has also freed up some 150 beds at its facilities in Jhajjar, Haryana. Regular meetings are being held to assess the situation and, on March 23, AIIMS suspended OPD (out-patient department) services as a precautionary measure.\nPlans for more isolation wards are being fine-tuned and will be reviewed by the ICMR in terms of protocol. This is among the steps being taken just in case the need arises, says Dr Indu Bhushan, CEO, National Health Authority (NHA). We are preparing ourselves should there be a [community-level] spread. That includes ensuring that private sector facilities support the treatment of COVID-19 cases. The NHA is assessing the capacity and readiness of private hospitals on this.\n3 Stimulus for domestic pharma\nThe abrupt stoppage in the flow of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), mostly from China, is impacting the Indian pharmaceutical sector, with fears now of a potential shortage of bulk drugs and intermediates. A corpus fund to incentivise Indian pharma companies is one way to encourage domestic production of APIs. The central department of pharmaceuticals has asked the Union ministry for environment, forest and climate change to waive the environmental impact assessment reports for projects by some categories of pharma firms. This, it is felt, will help reduce the time required to manufacture bulk drugs and APIs locally. The Centre has also pledged Rs 10,000 crore towards the production of critical drugs and another Rs 4,000 crore to promote manufacturing of medical equipment in the country.\nThe ICMR’s announcement on March 23 that the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine could be used as a preventive drug by COVID-19 high-risk groups (health workers or household members of patients) has led to a scramble, with chemists reporting that stocks are running out. In Mumbai, most shops are out of stock. Doctors have been trying a combination of drugs, which worked for other infections, to treat COVID-19 symptoms. If this drug is proven to work, we would have a need for it, says Dr C.S. Pramesh, director, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai.\nFollowing US president Donald Trump’s endorsement of hydroxychloroquine, Indian pharma companies Ipca and Zydus Cadila received bulk orders of the drug from the US. Even though India has a strong foothold in the production of hydroxychloroquine and pharma experts say production can be ramped up any time, there is already a noticeable shortage because of hoarding. While the government is planning to stockpile about 2 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, ensuring smooth supplies will also require a ban on its export, like the UK has done, as well as on over-the-counter sale.\n4 Reliable testing kits\nAs of 10 am, March 25, India had tested 22,928 samples for COVID-19, according to ICMR. This includes more than 500 random sample tests. The governing body for testing in India had come under fire for limiting the testing criteria in the initial days of the outbreak to those who had travelled to countries affected by the virus or had come in close contact with a COVID-19 patient. While about 300,000 test kits were available, only about 9,000 samples had been tested in the first week of March. Without data, it is hard to gauge the extent of the spread or make projections on the course the disease will take. Testing can slow down the disease, says K. Sujatha Rao, former Union health secretary.\nOn March 20, ICMR expanded the testing criteria to include even those who showed flu-like symptoms but had not travelled to countries reporting an outbreak of the disease. Two days later, it was announced that private labs would be granted licences for testing and orders would be placed with Indian companies to produce COVID-19 test kits. Private labs, however, say it is too early to comment on whether they can start testing since quality-compliant kits are not freely available. Also, the countrywide lockdown has crippled public transport, affecting staff strength in the labs.\nDr Navin Dang, founder of Dr Dang’s Labs (one of the private facilities approved for testing), favours widespread testing. A few kits might be lost, but lives are also saved, he says. An ideal situation would be one like South Korea where mass testing is possible, where anyone with symptoms can be tested and isolated if needed. Dr Dang, however, discourages home tests. Self-assessment is not advisable as it is not reliable. The COVID-19 test has highly specific guidelines, nose and throat swabs are collected in protective packing and tested in labs with a biosafety level of 2 and above and a real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) system. Trained personnel are needed for it, he says.\nThe Centre has capped the pricing of the test at Rs 4,500 and urged private labs to conduct the test free of cost, if possible. It has also mandated that only US Food and Drug Administration and European CE certified test kits be used. Pune-based Mylab Discovery Solutions, the first home company to get commercial approval for manufacturing the test kits, has produced indigenous kits that give results faster (in 2.5 hours as opposed to the standard 7 hours) and are cheaper (the company wants to price it around Rs 1,500). While ICMR has ordered about 200,000 kits from Germany, MyLab claims it can produce that many in a week. Its test kits, though, are yet to acquire international certifications. For me, quality is everything and I will not start testing till the time I am able to procure high-quality test kits. We cannot afford misdiagnosis at this stage, says Dr Dang.\n5. Lessons from home-quarantine\nFrom a COVID-19 positive man in Telangana, who hosted 1,000 guests at his wedding, to a London-returnee in Kolkata who repeatedly evaded testing, to the wife of a COVID-19 patient who escaped from quarantine and boarded a train to Agra, India’s fight against coronavirus is being thwarted by cases of individuals fleeing isolation. Who says COVID-19 cannot affect young people? It can. There have been severe symptoms in the youth too. Fewer, but it cannot be ruled out, says Dr Naresh Trehan, chairman and managing director, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram. Those who are old or immunocompromised are high-risk. Recovery is also slower for them. The lungs get damaged a bit in severe cases, and this can impact long-term cardiovascular health, though we don’t know exactly how yet. Dr Trehan says that COVID-19 being a new disease, it is hard to predict who will get sick and in what manner. Those breaking quarantine because they feel they are going to get only mild symptoms and will be fine are wrong. They are putting everyone at risk.\nWhile states like Maharashtra are hand-stamping quarantined patients, to allow easy detection in case they step out in public, Kerala has adopted a home-quarantine model that relies more on community support than coercive measures. It is very difficult to convince people to stay at home for two weeks. We had been constantly contemplating how people could be dissuaded from breaking the rules of quarantine without having to punish’ them, says Dr Amar Fettle, nodal officer for public health emergencies in Kerala’s health department. The state has close to 53,000 people under home quarantine. Dr Fettle credits this to community outreach. We have 30,000 Accredited Social Health Activists and 15,000 field workers, who visit homes and educate people on the importance of isolation and social distancing, he says.\nThe state health department also makes surprise calls twice daily to check in on those in quarantine. The calls make note of the medical and other supplies they may be in need of, which are then arranged for through the primary health centres or panchayats. We realised that when you let people know that you are working with them, and not merely enforcing rules, they are more willing to listen, adds Dr Fettle. There are the odd defaulters in Kerala as well, but few.\n6. Defeating fake news\nAnother challenge is to curb the fake news circulating on COVID-19 and counter it with a credible information source. Telangana is rolling out one such digital solution to fight the misinformation. We are planning a WhatsApp number, on which people can get [COVID-19-related] messages verified, a website as well as an archive of fact-checked information, says Dileep Konatham, director, digital media, Telangana government. There have also been instances of misreporting by local electronic media, such as quarantined individuals undergoing tests being reported as new COVID-19 cases, only to retract the news within a few hours without even a hint of an apology. Determined to come down hard on such misinformation, Telangana has invoked Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which stipulates imprisonment and fine for circulating false alarms/warnings’ related to disasters.\nThe AIIMS staff has been among the victims of misinformation. On March 24, a circular from the hospital mentioned how members of its staff living on rent were being harassed or evicted by home-owners over fears that they would pass on the infection. Myths help COVID-19 spread. Doctors must be supported, not stigmatised, says Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, adding that the pandemic is a daily evolving scenario. COVID-19 is a serious threat. Hospitals are taking steps to cope with the high numbers. The public needs to play a part too. If we are responsible today, it could stop the spread.\n7. Strengthening the healthcare force\nWith an estimated 0.62 doctors per thousand people, as opposed to the WHO ideal of 1 per thousand, India’s healthcare sector looks acutely under-staffed in the fight against coronavirus. According to Dr Devi Prasad Shetty, founder of the Narayana Health chain of hospitals, round-the-clock treatment of 2,000 patients in an ICU would require an estimated 2,800 nurses, 800 resident doctors and 400 anaesthetists. At the time of community transmission in China’s Wuhan (a city of 11 million), 9,689 patients were severe and needed to be admitted to an ICU. Going by Dr Shetty’s estimate, attending to, say, 9,600 patients in Delhi (a city of 18 million) will require the services of 13,440 nurses and 3,840 doctors. Last year, it was reported that Delhi has 4,644 sanctioned (not necessarily filled) posts for doctors while the Delhi Nursing Council puts the number of registered nurses in the city at about 7,000.\nTo bridge the shortfall, Dr Shetty recommends that postgraduate students of medicine be given the option by their institutions to serve at COVID-19 ICUs and wards as part of their training. He also suggests that the Indian Nursing Council permit final-year nursing students to take care of stable’ patients while young doctors trained overseas be given temporary licences to work under senior doctors in India. The government also needs to ensure the safety of healthcare workers. Doctors should be given personal protective equipment for practice runs and COVID-19 ICU simulations should be set up to teach them the safe practices, says Dr Shetty.\n8. A protocol for safe funerals\nIn Italy, mounting fatalities prompted the authorities to call in the army for safe disposal of bodies. As with other contagious diseases, there is a strict protocol in place for cremation/ burial of COVID-19 patients to minimise the risk of spreading infection. In India, in the absence of guidelines, there have been reports of crematoriums refusing to handle bodies of COVID-19 victims. In Delhi, the family of a woman who succumbed to the disease had to run from pillar to post for hours before the city’s largest crematorium let in her body for the last rites. According to officials at Chennai’s Kalyan Hospital, the role of the hospital ends with cleaning and securing a COVID-19 victim’s body in a body bag, and the local administration needs to take over from thereon. A protocol that ensures the timely, hassle-free and respectful funeral of COVID-19 victims is urgently required.\n9. Ensuring the sick know what to do\nThe protocol for treatment in Germany bans hospital walk-ins. Those who feel they have symptoms are forced to stay at home, dial a number, which can take 40-50 minutes to connect, and wait for a doctor to call back to see whether or not their condition is serious enough to be treated. This has led to severe psychological stress for patients, many of whom have gone on social media to share their stories. To avoid such a situation in India, a clear guideline needs to be designed so that individuals with COVID-19 symptoms know what to do. Examples from Italy point to the fact that the infection spread a lot more through people-to-people contact in hospitals. Italian doctors have emphasised that COVID-19 should be treated at home as much as possible.\nGoa is creating an app that guides a person on the next steps to take based on a self-assessment of symptoms. But as cases rise, this may not be enough. Some projections point to 300,000 cases soon. If that happens, India would collapse, as would any country, says Rao. She is, however, hopeful that the situation will remain manageable. We are already one of the five countries to have isolated the virus strain. We should be coming up with a standardised procedure or guidelines soon. At this point, meticulous planning will save the day. Those who are sick should be assisted with the least amount of waiting period, says Rao.\n",

首席部长皮纳拉伊·维贾扬说，由于可能有大量的人需要隔离，已经指示当地机构为此目的确定医院、建筑物、学校和礼堂。维贾扬在3月19日的一次视频会议上警告说，即使是一个小小的失误也会带来灾难性的后果。如果出现突发情况，现有设施将不足以满足要求。由于被观察的绝大多数人将是被特别照顾的家庭隔离人员，喀拉拉邦的战略是让当地机构对当地社区负责，确保他们在处理情况时不面临后勤问题。\n2家COVID-19专用医院和ICU\n印度的病床与人口比率仅为1:1000，总共约100万张病床，不到10万张ICU病床，手头只有4万台呼吸机，印度的医疗基础设施装备不足，无法应对COVID-19病例的急剧增加。通风机将是特别关键的。印度医学研究理事会（ICMR）在一份报告中说，约5%的COVID-19患者可能需要重症监护，其中一半可能需要呼吸机支持。\nCOVID-19影响肺部。严重时，肺部充满液体，呼吸困难。孟买塔塔纪念医院（Tata Memorial Hospital）麻醉、重症监护和疼痛科的J.V.Divatia医生说，呼吸机可以确保在治疗期间肺部不会塌陷。他警告说，如果印度的病人数量与中国或欧洲的病人数量相匹配，就会有麻烦。医院需要多少呼吸机还没有指南。在印度，我们保留了大约20%的病床用于重症监护，这在正常情况下已经足够了，Divatia博士说。\n印度提供的大多数高端呼吸机都是进口的，每台价格为500-1200万卢比。医院说国产设备质量不太可. 如果提前下订单，一周内可以购买和安装更多的通风机。由于国内对其产品的需求很少，印度制造商一直在出口通风机。位于德里的Croyox医疗服务公司生产的通风机，每台价值40万卢比，此前已出口到尼泊尔、泰国和欧洲。3月19日，随着政府禁止呼吸机出口，情况发生了变化。它希望在4月30日前在全国安装10万台为COVID-19患者定制的简易呼吸机。总部位于Mysuru的Skanray科技公司正受命制造5000台。如果COVID-19症状不是很严重，低端呼吸机可能是一个替代品，迪瓦蒂博士说。\n不过，阀门和传感器等通风机部件预计仍将供不应求。Skanray Technologies董事总经理Vishwaprasad Alva表示：我们将与其他准备生产这些定制通风机的公司分享技术诀窍，以便尽快满足需求。专家们还强调，必须确保医院有足够的氧气供应；由于氧气供应不足，欧洲许多医院难以挽救COVID-19患者。\n在各州，人们都在确定将这些医院改造成专门的COVID-19医院。这些医院或即将倒闭的医院，甚至教育机构的宿舍，都可以改建成250-300张床位的设施。第一个这样的设施是孟买H.N.信实基金会爵士医院在安德里的SevenHills医院设立的一个有100张床位的中心。马欣德拉集团（Mahindra Group）董事长阿南德马欣德拉（Anand Mahindra）承诺，他的俱乐部马欣德拉度假村（Mahindra Resorts）将成为COVID-19患者的护理中心。他还说，该集团的生产部门将看看他们是否能生产通风机。海得拉巴的奥维西医院和研究中心正在建立一个100张床位的独家中.\n新德里全印度医学科学研究所（AIIMS）拥有约1300名医生和1800名护士，为COVID-19病例设立了隔离病房。该研究所还在哈里亚纳贾尔的设施中腾出了大约150张床位。目前正在定期举行会议，评估情况，并于3月23日暂停门诊部（门诊部）服务，作为预防措施。\n更多隔离病房的计划正在微调，并将由ICMR根据协议进行审查。国家卫生局（NHA）首席执行官Indu Bhushan博士说，这是为应对需求而采取的措施之一。我们正在为（社区层面的）传播做好准备。这包括确保私营部门设施支持处理COVID-19病例。国家卫生局正在评估私立医院在这方面的能力和准备情况。\n3.对国内医药的刺激\n主要来自中国的活性药物成分（API）突然停止流动，正在影响印度制药行业，目前人们担心散装药物和中间体可能短缺。激励印度制药公司的语料库基金是鼓励国内生产原料药的一种方式。中央制药部已要求联合环境、森林和气候变化部放弃某些类别制药公司项目的环境影响评估报告。人们认为，这将有助于减少在当地生产大宗药物和原料药所需的时间。该中心还承诺生产10亿卢比的关键药物，并承诺另外4亿卢比促进该国医疗设备的制造。\nICMR于3月23日宣布，抗疟药物羟氯喹可被COVID-19高危人群（卫生工作者或患者家属）用作预防药物，引起了一片混乱，化学家报告说，库存已经用. 在孟买，大多数商店都缺货。医生们一直在尝试联合治疗其他感染的药物来治疗COVID-19症状。孟买塔塔纪念医院院长C.S.Pramesh博士说，如果这种药物被证明有效，我们就需要它。\n在美国总统特朗普批准羟基氯喹之后，印度制药公司Ipca和Zydus-Cadila收到了来自美国的大量订单。尽管印度在羟氯喹的生产上有很强的立足点，制药专家说，生产随时都可以增加，但由于囤积，已经出现了明显的短缺。虽然政府计划储备约200万剂羟基氯喹，但要确保供应顺畅，还需要像英国那样禁止其出口，以及禁止柜台销售。\n4个可靠的测试套件\n根据ICMR的数据，截至3月25日上午10点，印度共检测了22928份COVID-19样本。这包括500多个随机抽样测试。在印度进行检测的管理机构因将疫情最初几天的检测标准限制在那些前往受病毒影响国家或与一名COVID-19患者密切接触的人身上而受到抨击。虽然有大约30万个测试包可供使用，但在3月的第一周，只有大约9000个样品进行了测试。没有数据，就很难估计疾病传播的程度，也很难预测疾病的发展方向。前工会卫生部长K.SujathaRao说，检测可以减缓疾病的发展。\n3月20日，ICMR扩大了检测标准，甚至包括那些出现流感样症状但没有前往报告疫情的国家的人。两天后，有消息称，私人实验室将获得测试许可，并向印度公司下订单生产COVID-19测试. 然而，私人实验室说，现在就评论他们是否可以开始测试还为时过早，因为符合质量标准的工具包不是免费提供的。此外，全国范围内的封锁令公共交通瘫痪，影响了实验室的工作人员力量。\nDang博士的实验室（被批准用于测试的私人设施之一）的创始人纳文·丹博士赞成广泛的测试。他说，可能会丢失一些装备，但也会挽救生命。一个理想的情况是，像韩国那样，可以进行大规模检测，如果需要，任何有症状的人都可以进行检测和隔离。然而，丹博士不鼓励家庭测试。自我评估不可取，因为它不可靠。COVID-19检测具有高度的特异性，鼻拭子和喉拭子收集在保护性包装中，在生物安全等级为2及以上的实验室和实时PCR（polymerase chain reaction）系统中进行检测。他说，这需要训练有素的人员。\n该中心已将测试价格上限定为4500卢比，并敦促私人实验室在可能的情况下免费进行测试。它还规定只使用美国食品和药物管理局和欧洲CE认证的测试包。总部位于普纳的迈拉布发现解决方案公司是第一家获得商业批准制造测试套件的本土公司，该公司生产的本土套件能提供更快的测试结果（在2.5小时内，而不是标准的7小时），而且更便宜（该公司希望将其定价在1500卢比左右）。虽然ICMR已经从德国订购了大约20万个套件，但MyLab声称它可以在一周内生产出这么多。不过，该公司的测试套件尚未获得国际认证。对我来说，质量是一切，我不会开始测试，直到我能够获得高质量的测试包。我们不能在这个阶段误诊，唐博士说。\n5. 家庭隔离的教训\n从特朗加纳的一名COVID-19阳性男子在婚礼上接待了1000名宾客，到加尔各答的一名伦敦归国者一再逃避检测，再到一名COVID-19患者的妻子从隔离区逃出来，登上了前往阿格拉的火车，印度抗击冠状病毒的斗争因个人逃离隔离而受阻。谁说COVID-19不能影响年轻人？它可以。年轻人也有严重的症状。古鲁格拉姆Medanta医院董事长兼总经理Naresh Trehan博士说，数量减少，但不能排除这种可能性。那些年老或免疫功能受损的人是高危人群。对他们来说，复苏也比较缓慢。在严重的情况下，肺会受到一些损伤，这会影响到长期的心血管健康，尽管我们还不清楚具体是如何做到的。特雷汉博士说，COVID-19是一种新的疾病，很难预测谁会生病，以何种方式发病。那些因为觉得自己只会有轻微的症状而解除隔离的人是错误的。他们把每个人都置于危险之中。\n虽然像马哈拉施特拉邦这样的州正在对隔离的病人进行手工盖章，以便在他们在公共场合走出家门时容易被发现，但喀拉拉邦采取的家庭隔离模式更多地依赖于社区支持，而不是强制措施。很难说服人们在家呆两周。喀拉拉邦卫生部门负责突发公共卫生事件的节点官员阿马尔·费特尔博士（Dr Amar Fettle）说，我们一直在思考如何劝阻人们打破隔离规定，而不必惩罚他们。该州有近5.3万人被家庭隔离。费特尔博士将此归功于社区推广。他说：“我们有3万名经过认证的社会健康活动家和1.5万名外勤人员，他们到家里看望并教育人们隔离和疏远社会的重要性。”。\n国家卫生部还每天两次出其不意地打电话来检查那些被隔离的. 这些电话记录下他们可能需要的医疗和其他用品，然后通过初级保健中心或panchayats安排。费特尔博士补充道：我们意识到，当你让人们知道你在和他们一起工作，而不仅仅是执行规则时，他们更愿意倾听。喀拉拉邦也有奇怪的违约者，但很少。\n6。击败假新闻\n另一个挑战是遏制在COVID-19上传播的假新闻，并用可信的信息来源加以反击。Telangana正在推出一个这样的数字解决方案，以打击错误信息。Telangana政府数字媒体主管Dileep Konatham说：“我们正在计划一个WhatsApp号码，人们可以通过这个号码获得[COVID-19相关的]验证信息、一个网站以及一个事实核实信息的档案。”。还有一些地方电子媒体误报的例子，比如被隔离的个人在接受检测时被报道为新的COVID-19病例，结果在几个小时内收回消息，甚至连道歉的暗示都没有。Telangana决心严厉打击此类错误信息，援引了2005年《灾害管理法》第54条，其中规定，因传播与灾害有关的虚假警报/警告而被处以监禁和罚款。\nAIIMS的工作人员一直是错误信息的受害者之一。3月24日，这家医院的一份通告提到，该医院的工作人员因担心自己会传播感染而被房主骚扰或驱逐。神话帮助COVID-19传播。AIIMS主任Randeep Guleria博士说，医生必须得到支持，而不是羞辱，他补充说，大流行是每天都在演变的情况。COVID-19是一个严重的威胁。医院正在采取措施来应对这些高数字。公众也需要发挥作用。如果我们今天对此负责，它可以阻止传播。\n7号。加强医疗力量\n估计为与世卫组织的千分之一的理想相反，印度的医疗保健部门在抗击冠状病毒方面的人员严重不足。根据Narayana健康连锁医院创始人Devi Prasad Shetty博士的说法，在ICU中对2000名患者进行24小时治疗，估计需要2800名护士、800名住院医生和400名麻醉师。在中国武汉（1100万人口的城市）进行社区传播时，9689名患者病情严重，需要住进重症监护室。根据谢蒂博士的估计，在德里（一个1800万人口的城市）照顾9600名病人需要13440名护士和3840名医生的服务。去年，据报道，德里有4644个被批准的（不一定是被填补的）医生职位，而德里护理委员会（Delhi Nursing Council）估计，该市注册护士的数量约为7000人。\n为了弥补这一不足，Shetty博士建议，医学研究生可以由他们的机构选择在COVID-19 icu和病房服务，作为他们培训的一部分。他还建议印度护理委员会允许最后一年的护理学生照顾稳定的病人，而在海外接受培训的年轻医生则获得临时执照，在印度的高级医生手下工作。政府还需要确保医护人员的安全。Shetty博士说，医生们应该在实习期间得到个人防护设备，COVID-19 ICU模拟系统应该建立起来，教他们安全操作。\n8个。安全葬礼的礼节\n在意大利，不断增加的死亡人数促使当局要求军队安全处置尸体。与其他传染病一样，COVID-19患者的火化/埋葬也有严格的程序，以将感染传播的风险降到最低。在印度，由于缺乏指导方针，有报道称火葬场拒绝处理COVID-19遇难者的尸. 在德里，一位死于疾病的妇女的家人不得不从一个柱子跑到另一个柱子上，几个小时后，这个城市最大的火葬场才让她进入身体进行最后的仪式。据金奈的Kalyan医院的官员说，医院的作用结束于将一具COVID-19受害者的尸体清理并固定在尸袋中，当地政府需要从中接管。迫切需要一项议定书，确保及时、无争议和尊重地为COVID-19受害者举行葬礼。\n9号。确保病人知道该怎么做\n德国的治疗方案禁止医院内的非法闯入。那些觉得自己有症状的人被迫呆在家里，拨一个号码，这个号码可能需要40-50分钟才能接通，然后等待医生回电话，看他们的病情是否严重到可以治疗。这给患者带来了严重的心理压力，他们中的许多人通过社交媒体分享自己的故事。为了避免在印度出现这种情况，需要设计一个明确的指导方针，让有COVID-19症状的人知道该怎么做。意大利的例子表明，在医院里，感染更多地通过人与人之间的接触传播。意大利医生强调，COVID-19应该尽可能在家接受治疗。\nGoa正在创建一个应用程序，根据症状的自我评估，指导人们采取下一步行动。但随着案件的增多，这可能还不够。一些预测指出，很快将有30万起病例。如果这种情况发生，印度就会崩溃，任何国家也一样，饶毅说。不过，她希望局势将保持可控。我们已经是分离病毒株的五个国家之一。我们应该很快制定出一个标准化的程序或指导方针。在这一点上，周密的计划将挽救这一天。Rao说，那些生病的人应该在最少的等待时间内得到帮助",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Mortality rate in the novel coronavirus pandemic is the hinge of all arguments on the issue. Germany stands out from its neighbours with a jaw-droppingly low Covid-19 mortality rate of 0.6 per cent despite having more cases than France and the UK put together. How is this possible? Are there any lessons for India?\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has brought the world to a standstill. With its origin in Wuhan, the virus has spread to most parts of the world and is wreaking ever-increasing havoc.\nThe viral outbreak was at first brushed aside as China’s problem by most countries. Once the virus spread to the US and Europe, the outbreak was still underplayed by comparing it to the common flu. Many politicians and scientists even compared its mortality rate as similar to that of the common seasonal flu that affects the US and other countries every year.\nThis has all now changed, and for good. Politicians, doctors and scientists alike are now taking this outbreak very seriously. No wonder the World Health Organisation finally gave in to pressure from around the world to declare a pandemic.\nWith China now recovering well - at least on paper - and opening up its cities to resume normal service, the focus has shifted to Europe, the US and India (South Asia).\nThe mortality rate in China is 4 per cent (official figures), but it is a whopping 10.1 per cent in Italy, 7.4 per cent in Spain, 5.3 per cent in France and 4.9 per cent in the UK.\nThe US, which is seeing a breakout across its states, has a mortality rate of 1.5 per cent as of now.\nI spoke to a few German contacts and also analysed the data coming out of Germany to ascertain how and why the mortality rates in Germany are as low as 0.6 per cent. Below is a summary of my understanding.\nDEMOGRAPHICS:\nDemographically analysing the outbreak, Germany has been lucky thus far. Germany and Italy have a similar percentage of adults aged above 60.\nHowever, the median age for confirmed cases of Covid-19 is 47 years in Germany, compared with 63 in Italy. Germany has somehow not got its elderly infected as much as a few other nations and hence this directly translates to a lower mortality rate.\nNow, we may have to study the sociological aspects of the two countries to ascertain why such a disparity exists when it comes to the breakup of the infected. It is popularly said the youngsters in Italy spend longer times with the older generation in Italy. But we will have to do an extensive analysis to validate this opinion.\nTESTING:\nOne cannot stress the importance of testing in order to handle the Covid-19 outbreak better, but even here I noticed tiny differences in the way Germany has handled this entire situation.\nB. Germany test early: Germany, unlike many other European nations, the US or India, has a decentralised medical system. The government or the Chief Medical Council does not control the testing process across the 16 federal states in Germany.\nThe Robert Koch Institute (similar to CDC of USA or ICMR of India) only provide recommendations. The 16 states are responsible for their own procedures when it comes to handling the crisis. This ensured that there was no delay in choosing the testing labs and putting in a centralised process in place. It also meant that Germany started with extensive testing as early as mid-February. Given that the cases are identified well early, it’s easier to treat them and prevent further spread by contact tracing mechanisms. This is something India must look at in the future. Owing to the centralised structure, India sometimes sees delays in rolling out measures and procedures and loses out on precious time. Extensive testing is also something every country must invest in to stop the spread.\nDOUBTS OVER MISSING COUNTS: \nLike any story, this low mortality figure of Germany has been contested by a few. More so owing to the latest statements made by the Robert Koch Institute to the Agence France-Presse which reads:\nWe don’t consider post-mortem tests to be a decisive factor. We work on the principle that patients are tested before they die.\nIt means Germany does not test for Covid-19 infection in those who have already died. Hence there is a chance that they may have missed out on a few deaths that happened before the patient was tested.\nNevertheless, even if we doubled the number of deaths, the mortality rates still end up around a super-impressive 1.2 per cent.

The results came out negative.\nBut their blood samples were taken again in the late hours of Tuesday -- the results are expected today.\nQureshi and others don't have any symptoms of Covid-19. But Chinese doctors recommended that the Pakistani delegation self-quarantine for at least five days as a precautionary measure.\nBased on the recommendation, the delegation will be checked again after the five-day period.\nRAPID SPREAD \nCovid-19 has spread like wildfire across Pakistan -- the national tally is 249 -- after the federal government decided to transfer Pakistani pilgrims from the Iran-Taftan border to their respective provinces. (They were quarantined for at least 14 days at the border.)\nProvincial governments have taken it upon themselves to test all entering pilgrims and have allocated isolation units to quarantine them.\nPakistan has closed its borders with Iran and Afghanistan; it has banned large public gatherings and closed markets, malls and educational institutions.\nThe rise in Covid-19 cases -- emerging from all parts of the country -- has raised serious questions over the federal government's capability to tackle the outbreak at the Taftan border.\nSo far, Sindh province has reported the highest number of cases. There is a massive inflow of pilgrims, causing locals to fears to fear the spread of the virus.\nPM APPEALS FOR JOINT FIGHT\nIn his first address to the nation on Covid-19, Prime Minister Imran Khan called for calm and a joint fight against the pandemic, and underscored the need for protective measures to win the \"war\" against the pathogen.\n\"I want to tell you that this virus will spread further,\" he said on Tuesday. \"Keep that in mind...It is spreading in other parts of the world where there are better medical facilities and hospitals and where institutions are stronger.\"\nKhan said the option of a national lockdown was considered but ruled out because people -- including 25% of the population who live in extreme poverty -- could die of hunger.\nHe said the virus was dangerous for old people as it attacked their already-weakened immune system, but added that 97% of those infected had recovered.\n",

Henk Bekedam, the WHO Representative to India, was quoted as saying that the \"commitment of the Indian government from the top level has been enormous, and very impressive\".\nAt the very first level -- unlike China, which long remained in denial mode -- the Indian government was quick enough to activate its health management system and issue necessary travel advisories. Many state governments followed suit, leading to the early detection and isolation of infected patients.\nMoreover, the state machinery -- led by the Ministry of Health and other related agencies -- were prompt enough to issue 'valid precautionary guidelines' to keep the public well-informed and prepared.\nThe monitoring of the coronavirus outbreak at the PMO level has backed this process. Well-coordinated action plans include careful airport checking, active health laboratories and the quick establishment of quarantine facilities across the country. The strategy of the government has been to stick to the prevention is better than cure’ model.\nMore importantly, the Indian government has also been applauded globally for safely flying back many of its citizens -- especially workers and students stuck abroad in the mainland China and other coronavirus-affected countries, speaking volumes about the government’s concern and efforts for its citizens.\nIn addition, Indian efforts have remained completely aligned to guidelines from the WHO, which has been monitoring the crisis since it began and advocating the aggressive testing, tracking and isolation of as many Covid-19 (the disease caused by the novel coronavirus) cases as possible.\nTo sum it up, managing a new virus outbreak is never a easy task for any state, but the way the Indian emergency response system has been activated holds lessons for the other countries in the future.\nAbhishek Pratap Singh has a PhD in China Studies from JNU and teaches at the Deshbandhu College, University of Delhi.

We will minimize the impact on the economy of the people.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the southeastern city of Daegu and parts of North Gyeongsang province as special disaster zones, the presidential Blue House spokesman Kang Min-seok said.\nForty-one of the new coronavirus cases were from Daegu, where a secretive church at the center of the outbreak is located. The church has been linked to over 61% of cases, KCDC Deputy Director Kwon Jun-wook told a briefing on Sunday.\nAmong the special disaster zones is Cheongdo county, home to around 43,000 people, where another cluster of coronavirus cases is located, and where South Korea’s first victim of the virus died.\nThe number of infected patients have been decreasing the past week, and a daily infection has dropped from the previous week’s 500 to 100, health minister Park Neung-hoo told reporters on Sunday.\nAccording to KCDC’s Kwon, the drop in new cases comes after most of the mass infection cases linked to the church members were identified. What’s more important now is the remaining clusters of infection that is quietly making headway.\nHe pointed to a call center in Seoul, medical centers and nursing homes across as the new clusters.\nStarting Sunday, South Korea began to subject visitors from France, Germany, Britain, Spain and the Netherlands to - special entry procedure’ - stricter border checks. It has imposed similar rules on travelers coming from China, Italy and Iran - countries that are suffering a major outbreak.\nApart from measuring temperature at the airport, visitors from those countries now need to download an app the South Korean government rolled out to report whether they have any symptoms related to the virus everyday.\nSouth Korea is now planning to expand the procedure to all of its citizens and foreigners entering the country.\nGiven the development of the global pandemic, we don’t see it will be as meaningful to apply the special entry procedure on a particular country any more, said Park.\nSouth Korea has been testing hundreds of thousands of people and tracking potential carriers like detectives, using cell phone and satellite technology.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "With borders slamming shut, schools and businesses closing and increasingly drastic restrictions on movement in place, tens of millions of people were hunkered down Tuesday, heeding government calls to isolate themselves and slow the spread of the new coronavirus.\nFrom Southeast Asia to Europe to the Americas, people found their lives upended by lockdowns and social distancing.\nShoppers in Malaysia stood in long lines to stock up at picked-over supermarkets. Commuters in the Philippines waited in huge traffic jams at checkpoints set up to take their temperatures before entering the capital city. Officials in seven San Francisco Bay Area counties issued a sweeping shelter-in-place mandate, ordering millions of residents to stay at home and go outside only for food, medicine and outings that are absolutely essential.\nThe cancellations of treasured holidays and community events continued to build, with Thailand saying it was calling off its water festival in April and the organizers of the so-called \"most exciting two minutes in sports\"- the Kentucky Derby - reportedly prepared to announce the delay the horse race for the first time since World War II.\nFresh moves to contain the virus came even as Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus was first detected late last year and which has been under lockdown for weeks, reported just one new case on Tuesday.\nThe fronts in the battle have clearly shifted outside China, with its caseload now outnumbered by those outside its borders. And Spain is now the fourth-most infected country, surpassing South Korea, where new cases have been subsiding.\nWith the number of cases worldwide topping 181,000, a surge of patients in Madrid's hospitals fueled worries across Europe of what lies ahead. Pleas went out to funnel masks and ventilators to places struggling with soaring caseloads.\n\"There is no easy or quick way out of this extremely difficult situation,\" Mark Rutte, the prime minister of the Netherlands, said in the first televised speech by a Dutch premier since 1973.\nThe virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, for most people, but severe illness is more likely in the elderly and people with existing health problems. More than 79,000 people have recovered from the illness.\nNevertheless a growing sense of crisis has roiled financial markets. Shares reversed early losses in Asia on Tuesday after the U.S. stock market plunged to its worst day in more than three decades and huge swaths of many economies came to a standstill as businesses and travel shut down due to the outbreak.\nOnly China, Italy and Iran have more infections than Spain, where the number increased by roughly 20%, to 9,191 and fatalities rose to 309, according to the Spanish Health Ministry. It switched to a new reporting system, so the actual number may be higher.\nA somber Rutte told viewers \"a large part\" of the Netherlands' 17 million people are likely to contract the virus. So far, 1,413 people have tested positive and 24 have died. The government closed schools, restaurants and bars and banned gatherings of more than 100 people.\nCountries from Canada to Switzerland, Russia and Malaysia announced sharp new restrictions on the movement of people across their borders.\n\"We have a window of time at the moment to slow the spread of the virus,\" said Ulrike Demmer, a spokeswoman for Germany's government, which reversed its earlier insistence that border controls would not work. It imposed new limits on crossings with France, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark and Luxembourg, after German infections increased by more than 1,000 over 24 hours.\nMalaysia banned foreign travel and is allowing only essential services to stay open. France allowed people to leave home only to buy food, go to work, or do other essential tasks, restrictions President Emmanuel Macron said were heightened because people hadn't complied with earlier guidelines and \"we are at war.\"\nIndia shut down the Taj Mahal to visitors. Most schools and entertainment facilities were already closed across India, the world's second-most populous country with 1.3 billion people.\nThe first confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Somalia, which has one of Africa's weakest health systems after nearly three decades of conflict.\nAs the pandemic expanded its reach, China and South Korea were trying to hold their hard-fought gains. China is quarantining new arrivals, who in recent days have accounted for an increasing number of cases, and South Korea starting Thursday will increase screenings of all overseas arrivals.\nInfections have continued to slow in South Korea's worst-hit city of Daegu. But there's concern over a steady rise of infections in the Seoul metropolitan area, where new clusters have emerged.\nItaly reported another jump in infections, up more than 3,000 to 27,980. With 2,158 deaths - including 349 more in just the last 24 hours - Italy now accounts for well over a quarter of the global death toll. Cases, however, slowed in Lombardy, the hardest-hit region.\nIn the United States, officials urged older Americans and those with chronic health conditions to stay home, and recommended all group gatherings be capped at 50 people. Americans returning from abroad encountered chaotic airport health screenings that clearly broke all virus-fighting rules against having packed crowds close together.\nSchool closings in 56 countries kept more than 516 million students home, the United Nations said. New York City joined those ranks Monday, closing a school system with 1.1 million students.\nStill, some countries have resisted more stringent measures to contain the virus.\nIn Britain, bars and restaurants remained open and there was no ban on large events. The prime minister's spokesman said closing schools hadn't been ruled out, but \"the scientific and medical advice is that that's not a step which we should be taking at this point in time.\"\nA senior official from South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Kwon Jun-wook, urged people to take the virus seriously and follow recommended precautions.\n\"In a similar way to how the Sept. 11 attacks completely changed people's perception about security, quarantine authorities like us believe the daily lives of all the people around the world will be changed because of COVID-19,\" Kwon told a briefing Tuesday. \"From now on, if you are sick, you should voluntarily rest to prevent a spread to others.\"\n",

When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!\" Zhao tweeted on Thursday with a video clip of the CDC director's comments.\nHe, however, did not elaborate his allegation against the US army.\nOn March 5, Zhao told a media briefing that the origin of the virus is yet to be determined, raising question over reports that the virus had originated from a live animals market in Wuhan in December.\n\"It is yet undetermined where the virus originated. Wherever its origin may be, China and all the other affected countries are victims faced with the challenge in containing its spread,\" Zhao said.\nAsked on Thursday at a media briefing here whether China has proof that the coronavirus didn't originate in China and if so, where did it originate, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said the \"origin of the virus can only be determined by science. We need to rely on scientific and professional views. We don't hope to see anyone making an issue out of this to stigmatise other countries.\"\n\"With COVID-19 developing into a pandemic, the world should come together to fight it instead of levelling accusations and attacks against each other, which is not constructive at all,\" Geng said.\nWhen asked about US President Donald Trump's televised speech on Thursday in which he said that coronavirus started in China and spread to other places, Geng said China has been \"acting in an open, transparent and highly responsible way since the outbreak of the epidemic\".\n\"We have taken the most comprehensive, rigorous and thorough measures in this all-out, people's war against the epidemic. Such extraordinary efforts have resulted in a growing positive momentum in epidemic control across the country,\" he said.\nOn Monday, Geng condemned US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for branding the coronavirus as \"Wuhan virus\" terming his remarks as \"despicable behaviour\" and an attempt to stigmatise the Communist country.\nThe deadly virus that first originated in Wuhan in December last has claimed over 4,600 lives and infected more than 124,330 people across 118 countries and territories.\nChina remains the hardest-hit with more than 80,000 infections and 3,100 deaths.\n",

This Monday, the 17 day of February, marked the end of the country's winter holiday to celebrate the Chinese New Year, but the start of classes was suspended indefinitely as part of measures to combat the new coronavirus (Covid-19).\nTo avoid delays in the education programme, the government of the country has launched an online learning platform for the millions of students prevented from attending classes. The system is being operated by technological giants such as Huawei, Baidu and Alibaba. W\nThe approach varies according to age. While primary school students will be able to follow TV lessons through programs made available on state channels, older students will have access to an online platform that offers lessons from a dozen different disciplines. Teachers must update the system according to the needs of students: for the first week, there are a total of 169 classes divided by 12 separate subjects from primary and secondary education.\nIn a report published at the Xinhua State News Agency, a 14-year-old girl explains that teachers are using a video platform to explain to students how they can learn online. Each session lasts about fifteen minutes. There are also professors available to cast doubt on the process or content on WeChat channels, a WhatsApp-like message platform.\nSince the beginning of February university students have followed a similar method. In a statement, the Ministry of Education asks universities and educational institutions to use technological resources to \"continue online teaching activities\" as a way of \"ensuring progress and quality of education during the epidemic prevention and control season\"Yeah. The Government adds that \"support platforms and teaching resources for teachers\" should be made available and that ways should be used to \"use data on student behavior [on platforms] to understand the online learning process.\"\nAcademic institutions try to keep an optimistic perspective. \"The epidemic situation in which we are facing is a challenge for us, but it is also an opportunity to promote the digitisation and computerization of the learning system,\" said the director of Tsinghua University in Beijing in statements to the Xinhua agency.\nEducation-focused technology, known as the English amalgam edtech, is a growing sector. In 2020, this market must exceed the 230 billion euro according to data from Daxue and China is the largest investor in the sector. 17zuoye (joint homework in Portuguese) is considered one of the largest online education platforms in the country. It brings together teachers and parents with over 60 million registered users.\nIn addition to Chinese giants Huawei, Baidu (Google equivalent search engine) and Alibaba being recruited by the Chinese government to ensure the operation of the platform, Chinese Mobile telecom operators, China Unicom and China Telecom must ensure that there is sufficiently large broadband and an adequate number of servers to provide online learning tools. About 600 thousand teachers have also been using Alibababa's video conferencing system, Dingtalk, to teach.\nIn addition to the applications of teaching technology, the Chinese government has also made available a new mobile application that alerts Chinese citizens when there is \"close contact\" with someone potentially infected with the new coronavirus. bars that is read through certain applications using the cell phone camerYeah.\nIt was at the end of 2019 that a new coronavirus began to spread among humans. Since then, more than 71.300 people have fallen ill throughout Asia, with China gathering the vast majority of cases, provoking around 1775 fatalities around the world. So far, only five of the deaths recorded outside China. Symptoms include dry cough, fever, fatigue and respiratory distress, symptoms similar to those of a flu for most people, although a small proportion of patients develop pneumonia, with the most serious cases causing organ failure. More than 11 thousand infected people are already recovering from the disease.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nIn addition to the impact on the education sector, the new coronavirus has already caused more than two dozen airlines (including Air France, British Airways, and Iberia) to cancel flights to China. The epidemic is also causing delays in the manufacturing chain of several companies, which depend on parts produced in factories in that country. Toyota, for example, has extended the closure of its factories after the Chinese New Year period, in the face of the outbreak of the new coronavirus. Although the company reopened three of the four factories in the country this Monday, the fourth in Chengdu must remain closed for another week. The new coronavirus was also theme during Apple's performance, with the company admitting that it has suppliers in Wuhan, Covid-19 epicenter, and that the virus can hinder operations in Apple factories in China.\nLast week, the Mobile World Congress (MWC), the big Barcelona market dedicated to mobile technology, was cancelled on the basis of fears associated with the new coronavirus outbreak and associated travel restrictions. Facebook also cancelled an international marketing conference scheduled for March in San Francisco",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that it takes 675 million dollars (about 613 million euros) to implement a global plan to combat viruses in the next three months, this Wednesday was announced at a press conference. The WHO also revealed that experts will meet in Geneva (Switzerland) to 11 and 12 in February to set priorities in research and development of medicines, diagnostics and vaccines. So far, there are almost 25 thousand infected people and almost 500 deaths from this virus.\nFor now, the WHO has called for a fund of 675 million dollars to combat the virus in the world and in China between February and April. Of these, 60 million dollars (about 54 million euros) will be for WHO operations and the rest for those countries that are especially at risk. This is the budget for the Strategic Plan of Preparation and Response, which includes activities and resources for international organizations to combat the new coronavirus. The aim is to limit the transmission between people, especially in the most vulnerable countries, as well as to identify, isolate and care for patients early, or to minimise the economic and social impact.\n\"My greatest concern is in countries that today have no systems to operate to detect people infected by the virus,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"Urgent support is needed to reinforce health systems that detect, diagnose and protect more transmission between humans and healthcare professionals.\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the WHO, also said that \"very soon\" a WHO team will go to China.\n\"The effectiveness of the response to the outbreak depends on preparatory measures,\" said Mike Ryan, director of the WHO emergency programme. \"This is why we are seeking resources to safeguard the most vulnerable countries.\"\nOne of the big issues is also the advance in treatments for the new coronavirusYeah. So far, there's no specific drug or vaccine against the virus. Due to some speculation on the development of new treatments, the WHO has made a point of reinforcing this week that \"there are still no effective therapies against this 2019-nCoV\" and that several experts are meeting this month to set the priorities for these advances.\nAlthough there has been no specific treatment, the Chinese Government has suggested antiviral drugs used to treat HIV, such as lopinavir and ritonavir, and the inhalation of a dose of clouded interferon-alpha twice a day. Gilead Sciences is also testing an antiviral therapy for Ebola virus with patients infected with the new coronavirus.\nAs for the vaccine, scientists in Australia have developed a version of the laboratory-grown virus, which may be an important step in the development of a vaccine. Also, the Alliance for Epidemic Ready Innovations (CEPI) has already announced that three different research teams are developing vaccines and that the objective is to start clinical trials in June.\nThe Russian health minister, Mikhail Murashko, also said this Wednesday that scientists in Russia hope it will take at least eight to ten months to develop a vaccine for the virus. \"Today the process of developing a vaccine is not done in a short period of time. A vaccine is being developed in at least eight to ten months,\"he said, quoted by the Russian Interfax News Agency. Last week, Russia announced that it was working on a vaccine with China.\nThe choice of a new name for this virus, temporarily designated 2019-nCoV by the WHO, may appear somewhat smaller. \"The name [official] of the new virus is very late because the focus so far has been on public health response,\" said Crystal Watson, professor at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Safety (USA), cited on the BBC websitYeah. However, there are some reasons why the name choice becomes more of a priority. \"When we do not have an official name, there is a danger that people will start using terms like'Chinese virus'and that they may create a negative reaction against certain populations.\"\nThe International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) is responsible for choosing the name. According to the Committee's guidelines, the name shall not include geographical locations, names of persons, the name of an animal or type of food, or references to a culture or industry. This name should be short and descriptive, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). A group from ICTV is already deliberating on the new name.\nOfficial names can also become a problem. Moreover, in 2015, WHO criticised the name MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as it could provoke, for example, a negative reaction against members of religious and ethnic communities.\nThere is still a lot to uncover about the virus, but one of the data that is thought to be already acquired is what transmission can occur in the period before the onset of symptoms. Initially, one of the strongest evidence for this hypothesis came from a Chinese woman who had had a meeting in Munich: she would have infected other people and would have had symptoms only days later. This situation was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. However, the researchers had only relied on the accounts of German patients. The Robert Koch Institute, the German public health agency, and the Bavarian Food Safety and Health Authority spoke to the Chinese patient and were now informed that she still had symptoms during her stay in Germany. Despite this new information, other data substantiate the hypothesis that asymptomatic transmission takes place.\nThis Wednesday also announced the case of the youngest person infected with the new coronaviruYeah. The Chinese media reported that a baby was diagnosed with the virus only thirty hours after birth, referred to in the English newspaper The Guardian. According to Chinese state television CCTV, the virus had been detected in the baby's mother before delivery. This Wednesday also confirmed four more cases in Singapore, including a six-month-old baby.\nAlso on the transmission of the virus, it was confirmed in the last week that a doctor who issued an alert on the coronavirus is also infected. The story of this ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang, began in mid-December when he wrote a message in his group of college friends. In this message, you said that in your hospital there were seven patients with SARS-like symptoms. He would also ask that his friends and their families be careful.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nAs the message eventually went viral, the police accused him of spreading rumors, which could lead to his arrest for seven years. According to the Spanish newspaper El Pais, seven other doctors received the same warning. The doctor eventually had to sign a statement in which he assumed his failure and promised not to do the same again. A few days later, he became infected with the new coronavirus after treating a patient.\nThe new coronavirus has not yet arrived in Africa, but the African Disease Control and Prevention Centres have already activated their emergency operations center to tackle the virus and are organising a workshop in Senegal for 15 African countries.\nAn isolation wing is ready in the hospital in Khartoum, Sudan. Laboratories in Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Madagascar or Sierra Leone already have the equipment to detect the viruYeah. Passengers arriving at Cameroon or Gambia airports are being monitored for fever and other viral symptoms. The Democratic Republic of Congo has already prevented its citizens from travelling to China. Burkina Faso asked Chinese citizens to postpone their trips. Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania have suspended flights to China",

But even in the hospital bed he continued to fight against the Chinese Government. He gave interviews by text, made available a selfie of himself hooked up to breathing machines, helped journalists draw a picture of a public health crisis and told how he had been forced to shut up.\nFor a short time after his death, there were active Weibo- who has 1500 million \"topical\" users such a s \"the Wuhan government owes an apology to doctor Li Wenliang\" and \"we want freedom of expression\", linking the censorship of the Chinese regime to the initial flaws in the response to the outbreak.\nAccording to Reuters, the Central Commission for Disciplinary Inspection, which punishes corruption in the Public Administration, announced that it will send investigators to Wuhan to verify \"issues raised by the people in relation to Dr. Li Wenliang\", without going into further detail.\nIn the face of the criticism, President Jinping justified this Friday that China is doing everything possible to halt the progression of the disease and defeat the coronavirus, which has already killed 638 people and infected more than 31 thousand worldwideYeah.\nXi spoke on the phone with US head of state, Donald Trump, to whom he strengthened this guarantee, while asking for a \"more reasonable\" reaction from the United States to the outbreak of this infectious disease.\n\"We have adopted the most comprehensive and rigorous measures of prevention and control. We have declared a people's war against the epidemic,\"assures Xi Jinping, according to Chinese television CCTV. \"We are totally confident that we are capable of fighting the epidemic. The long-term trend of economic development in China will not change,\"the Chinese President said.\nThe Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had complained that the US and other countries are closing borders on travellers from China, when the World Health Organisation does not advocate travel restrictions. Or for closing down the American consulate in Wuhan, the city where the first infections were detected. The way Washington described the phone call between Xi and Trump, however, focused more on the recent diplomatic and economic successes of the two major powers than on the fight against the coronavirus.\n\"The two leaders agree to continue comprehensive communication and cooperation between the two parties. They also highlighted the great achievement of the recent first phase of the US-China trade agreement and reaffirmed the commitment to its implementation,\"stated on Twitter the White House spokesman, Judd Deere.\nChina and the US have highlighted that they are investing large resources in the fight against the new virus, but, says the Washington Post, miscommunication between the two countries has been noted, caused by a lack of information sharing and mutual trust at a time of increasing global competition and trade war.\nThe new coronavirus was seen by Beijing as a risk to the regime and public health and, after initial delay in its response, the government pressed ahead with everything it had against the virusYeah. It has quarantined cities in central China (many millions of people), built up two hospitals in a few days, deployed military doctors to the city of Wuhan and deployed hundreds of drones to spread disinfectant in this city.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThe propaganda calling for citizens to mobilise against the disease was not neglected. There are television announcements praising the collective effort and the union of the people against this disease.\nAccording to the American newspaper Washington Post, delay in responding to the disease may lead Central Authorities to hold Wuhan authorities accountable. Beijing, under accusations of not being transparent about the size of the outbreak, has already admitted that it needs \"to improve the national emergency management system\".\nThe US Standard Financial rating agency Poor's revealed a forecast of Chinese economy growth for this year reduced by 0,75 percentage points due to coronavirus effects, anticipating that these temporary effects in China will spread worldwide. S&P pointed out, however, that it had a higher degree of uncertainty than usual, because it could not be predicted the severity of the outbreak",

They are, after all, 20, including two diplomats from the Portuguese embassy in Beijing, and they have all agreed to be in \"prophylactic isolation\" and no possibility of visits, even controlled, over two weeks at Pulido Valente Hospital and at facilities in Lisbon's Health Park, explained to the health minister at a press conference on Sunday night.\nEveryone will have agreed, Marta Temido assured, as Portuguese law does not provide for the compulsory quarantine of non-sick people, unlike in other countries. In addition to 16th Portuguese (and not 17, as originally announced), two Brazilian citizens were transferred from Wuhan \"who were also in China and accompanied our compatriots\", in addition to the two Portuguese diplomats, specified the ruler, flanked by four secretaries of state (Health, Foreign Affairs, Defence and Civil Protection) and the Director-General for Health.\nOn the 14-hour flight from Wuhan to France, citizens of three dozen European countries and 20 were stranded on a French military base near Marseilles for showing symptoms of possible contagion. The Portuguese were not in contact with these passengers in the enormous aircraft that carried them, an Airbus A-380, but still, and for a precautionary principle, they will be in this voluntary isolation in the prepared facilities (13 individual rooms in the Valente Pulido and another ten in the Health Park). In Oporto, the Military Hospital is also in place to receive those from the North, but this does not seem necessary for the time beingYeah. \"This was the last part of a very long journey\", stressed the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Teresa Ribeiro.\nEnsuring that there was \"calm in the approach to preventive measure\" that puts Wuhan repatriates in isolation, Marta Temido stressed that this is a measure \"that is in line with what is being done by other countries\" and is based on the \"epidemic phase\" and \"containment\" decreed at international level. He recalled that the Portuguese were \"used to being isolated\" in Chinese territory, where they spent several days at home. In this way, he added, they can also have better monitoring by health services\". Isolation should last forty days (the incubation period of the disease until the first symptoms appear) and \"active surveillance\" will be carried out by healthcare professionals twice a day.\nAt a time when an epidemiological inquiry was still ongoing into those repatriated by an International Sanity Team at Figo Maduro Airport, where they landed on board the C-130 of the Air Force picking them up in Marseille, the Minister explained that if any doubt were raised during this process, This would be clarified by telephone contact from the Health Directorate (DGS) medical helpline. \"Your possible medical validation will determine that the case is sent in accordance with the transport protocol to one of the reference hospitals,\" he said.\nNew tests\nAfter tests have been carried out on the way out of China, which have proved negative, the 20's are tested again here. At Pulido Valente, there will be harvests of biological material to be analyzed early Monday morning at the National Institute of Health, Doctor Ricardo Jorge (Insa). In a few hours it will be possible to see if any of them are infectedYeah.\nThroughout the isolation, if it is suspected that any of them are infected by the revelation of several symptoms, they will be transported immediately to Curry Cabral, a reference hospital for cases confirmed in a possible outbreak of the new coronavirus in Portugal (the others are St. John in Porto, and D. Stephania also in Lisbon and intended for children). In the infectious disease services of these hospitals there are negative pressure rooms (with ventilation systems that do not allow the air to escape), where suspicious cases validated by the DGS are committed until the Insa test results come in. These hospitals only commit suspicious cases validated by DGS and patients.\nUrged to explain why a plane with Chinese passengers landed in Ponta Delgada on Saturday after being refused landing in other countries, Health Director Grace Freitas stressed that none of them were coming from Wuhan.

        "news_content_translate_en": "The new coronavirus has caused more than 900 deaths and has infected over 40.500 people. The numbers should not stop here and even be aggravated by the end of the prolonged Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. To find out which countries the virus can be imported more easily, scientists from Germany have used a computational model. In the case of Portugal, the risk of importing the coronavirus is \"very low\", with the country in the 61st position on the relative risk list for importing the virus. The Health Directorate (DGS) also announced this Monday two more suspected cases of infection with the new coronavirus were six so far, and one of them was already negative at the beginning of the night. The second suspicious case, which had been referred to the University Hospital Centre of San Juan in Porto, it also had a negative result, informed the DGS already this Tuesday, a few minutes after midnight.\nCases of the new coronavirus have been confirmed in more than twenty countries. Even if the vast majority of cases are limited to China, there is still concern that they may spread further around the world. In order to assess the risk of importing cases to other countries, a team from the Humboldt University of Berlin and the Robert Koch Institute, both in Germany, used a computational model, considering the distribution of confirmed cases in China and the 4000 airport air transport network and more than 50.000 air routes. Airport closures due to the epidemic have already been included in the model.\nIt was concluded that Thailand (in addition to China) is the country most likely to have people arriving from one of the airports analysed with coronavirus. This list follows Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United States, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Cambodia. The first European country on this list is Germany, which is in 18th placeYeah. Although Angola is on the list of 13 African countries with top priority for the World Health Organisation (WHO) in the fight against the new coronavirus, it does not include the top-10 of African countries with the highest risk of importation in this model. This top is headed by Ethiopia, followed by Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, Algeria, Morocco, Mauritius, Reunion, Nigeria and Tunisia. Overall, according to the model, Angola is in 115th place.\n\"Portugal has a very low risk of import,\" says Public Dirk Brockmann of Humboldt University. \"It is in 61.th position with a relative import risk of 0,01%, which is about 20 times smaller than the risk of Germany.\" Nevertheless, while Germany has a risk of 0,2%, Thailand has 2,2%. Dirk Brockmann points out that the purpose of this model is to give an overview of the current situation and be a risk analysis tool that can be used by policy makers and public health authorities. In addition to providing country-specific alerts, the model provides data for specific airports.\nAlthough we've given so much to talk about, we still don't know enough about the new coronavirus. Efforts have not been lacking and scientists around the world have been paying attention to the virus. Among the latest news is the publication of the complete biomolecular code of the virus.\nSamples of the new coronavirus have been processed in laboratories around the world and raw information about the genetic code has been sent to the repository of the United States National Health Institutions. From there, a team from the University of California in Santa Cruz (USA) collected information from 29.903 nucleotides, adenine, timine, cytosine and guanine, the basic chemical elements that make up the DNA molecule, represented by letters A, T, C and G, and made it available in the public database Genome Browser BrowserYeah.\n\"By providing data on coronavirus in the Browser Genome at the University of California in Santa Cruz, this allows investigators to observe the structure of the virus and, more importantly, investigate how they can attack it,\" stated Hiram Clawson, a researcher at that university.\nThe way this coronavirus is transmitted has been another major issue. CoronVirus is transmitted by respiratory droplets, direct contact with infected secretions and aerosols in therapeutic procedures that produce them, DGS states. But how long does it persist on surfaces and how can it be inactivated? Two professors from the Greifswald University Hospital in Germany tried to answer these questions.\nTo find answers, they analyzed studies on coronavirus SARS and MERS. It was found that these viruses could persist on surfaces and remain infectious at room temperature on average between four and five days. \"Low temperatures and high humidity in the air further increase your life span\", says Gunter Kampf in a statement from his institution.\nAs for the inactivation of the various coronaviruses in tests with disinfectant solutions, agents with ethanol, commonly oxygenated water or sodium hypochlorite were found to be effective against coronavirus. If these agents were applied at appropriate concentrations, they would reduce the pathogenic particles from one million to 100 in about one minute. For researchers, these results may be extrapolated to the new coronavirus. \"We analyzed different coronavirus and the results were similar\", says Eike Steinmann.\nThis Tuesday and Wednesday, scientists, public health agency professionals, health ministers and research backers will be meeting in Geneva (Switzerland) to set priorities in research and development of medicines, diagnostics and coronavirus vaccineYeah. In this meeting organized by the WHO in conjunction with the Global Research Collaboration for the Preparation of Infectious Diseases, we will discuss the origin of the virus, identify knowledge gaps or medical products that should be necessary to minimise the impact of the epidemic. \"The meeting is expected to produce a global research agenda for the new coronavirus,\" says the WHO in communication.\nAn international mission led by the WHO also arrived in China this Monday to investigate the epidemic. Epidemiologists on this mission are trying to better understand how the transmission between people takes place, how the virus spreads in hospitals or why some people are dying.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThis Monday was also marked by the visit of the President of China, Xi Jinping, to various sites in Beijing, notably a community centre, a hospital or disease control centre. Xi Jinping was always seen with a mask and his temperature was measured. At Ditan Hospital, where coronavirus-infected patients are being treated, Xi Jinping even took part in a video conference with health professionals in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, which the Chinese President has not yet visited.\nThis is considered a rare public appearance of Xi Jinping during the epidemic and occurred days after the death of doctor Li Wenliang, who tried to warn colleagues about the virus and ended up being punished for spreading rumors. The visit also took place on the day when many Chinese return to work after an extended Chinese Lunar New Year vacation. Therefore, the WHO has already stressed that the number of cases outside China may be just \"the tip of an iceberg\"",

        "news_content_translate_en": "HONG KONG - Support for the demands of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong has grown even as rallies have paused due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to a survey conducted for Reuters that also showed a widespread lack of confidence in the government's ability to manage the COVID-19 crisis.  \n Demands for the resignation of Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, were supported by 63% of respondents in the poll, conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute between March 17-20, versus 57% in a poll it conducted in December.  \n Supporters of the protests outnumbered opponents by a ratio of roughly two to one, with 28% against them compared with 30% in a poll in December, and 58% supporting them, versus 59% previously.  \n The poll showed a significant increase in the levels of support for key demands of the often-violent demonstrations which rattled the city for most of last year and into early January before the coronavirus crisis.  \n The survey also showed a widespread lack of confidence in the government's coronavirus measures, with 54% expressing distrust and 33% giving the thumbs up.  \n The anti-government protests escalated in June 2019 over a since withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions of defendants to mainland China, and later morphed into a movement for greater democracy in the Chinese-ruled city.  \n Many protesters say Beijing has used its authority under the \"one country, two systems\" formula, agreed when Britain handed over the city to China in 1997, to undermine freedoms enjoyed in Hong Kong that are unavailable in the mainland.  \n \"It is understandable that protesters resort to extreme means,\" said Patrick Yeung, a 32-year-old IT worker who responded to the survey. \"I hope Beijing can meddle less in Hong Kong's affairs, which could actually stabilise Hong Kong and curb people's anger.\"  \n Beijing denies meddling in Hong Kong and blames the West for fomenting unrest.  \n For more comments from respondents see.  \n Lam's office and China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, which comes under the State Council, or cabinet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  \n Support for universal suffrage in Hong Kong, a core demand of protesters aimed at strengthening the territory's level of autonomy, rose to 68% from 60% in December.  \n An independent commission of inquiry, which protesters want to look into how the police handled demonstrations, is now supported by 76% of respondents versus 74% previously.  \n The demands of the protesters \"haven't been diluted, or forgotten, due to the epidemic situation,\" said Ma Ngok, associate professor of government and public administration at Chinese University of Hong Kong.  \n Opposition to the demands of the protesters has remained virtually unchanged at 15%.  \n \"The government should investigate the culprits behind the political crisis and should not accede to other demands from the protesters,\" said another respondent, Ming Hon, an unemployed 49-year-old who moved to Hong Kong from mainland China recently and had jobs in cleaning and construction.  \n For the poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points, 1,001 respondents were randomly surveyed by telephone in Cantonese, which is spoken by the vast majority of people in Hong Kong. The results were weighted according to the latest population figures.  \n  \n VIRUS RESPONSE  \n Following a large rally on New Year's Day in which some protesters clashed with police, crowds on the streets have dropped from many thousands to a few hundred as Hong Kongers adopted social distancing to fight the coronavirus.  \n Some recent protests focused on the government's decision not to fully close the border with mainland China, where the virus is believed to have originated. The administration has since banned all tourist arrivals.  \n Although Hong Kong has won praise for limiting the outbreak to roughly 450 cases and four deaths, the poll showed that many citizens remain distrustful of the government.  \n \"The results in combating the pandemic are because of the self-discipline of Hong Kong people. The government has nothing to do with it,\" said Evelyn Lau, a 23-year-old tutor who participated in the poll.  \n  \n OPPOSITION TO INDEPENDENCE  \n Another key finding of the survey is that while calls for Hong Kong's independence from China grew within the margin of error, opposition to the idea has dropped significantly and indifference has increased dramatically.  \n Support for independence rose from 17% in December to 20%, but opposition tumbled from 68% to 56%, and those not leaning either way doubled to 18%.  \n \"People talk more about it, so it becomes more easy to accept,\" said Samson Yuen, assistant professor in the political science department at Lingnan University, referring to the independence issue. \"When people talk more about 'liberating Hong Kong', it shifts the frame.\"  \n With Legislative Council elections due in September, the pro-democracy/pro-Beijing split remained virtually unchanged from last year's district council vote, with 58% saying they would vote for a pro-democracy candidate and 22% for a pro-Beijing one, with the rest undecided or not planning to vote.  \n The degree of support for the protests varied sharply by age, education and whether respondents were born in Hong Kong. Younger and better-educated people born in the city were far more likely to lean pro-democracy or support the protests.  \n The poll, the second in a series commissioned by Reuters from the independent polling firm to gauge public sentiment amid the city's worst political crisis in decades, showed respondents mainly blamed Lam's administration for the state of affairs.  \n Some 43% of respondents primarily blamed the Hong Kong government, compared with 47% in the previous poll, while 14% blamed the central government in Beijing versus 12% in December. The police and protesters were blamed by about 10% each in both polls.  \n Many protesters say they are incensed by what they see as an abuse of power by the police in dealing with the unrest. The police say they have used reasonable and appropriate force against illegal acts including vandalism and rioting.  \n China has denounced acts of violence in the protests, which it sees as being aimed at undermining Chinese sovereignty.

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING — US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (March 18) doubled down on his recent use of the term “Chinese virus” to refer to Covid-19, saying he was simply referring to the virus’ place of origin and that the expression was not racist. \n In a show of defiance against Chinese anger over the use of the term, the president used it within seconds of the start of the daily press conference of his Covid-19 task force, saying: “There’s some important developments in our war against the Chinese virus”. \n “No, no, it’s not racist at all … It comes from China,” Mr Trump said when asked why he was using the term amid rising reports of racism against Americans of Chinese ethnicity. \n “I have great love for all of the people from our country but, as you know, China tried to say at one point … that it was caused by American soldiers. That can’t happen. It’s not going to happen, not as long as I am president. It comes from China,” Mr Trump said. \n “Not think; I know,” he said when asked again whether it was definitive that the virus originated from China. \n Last Thursday, Beijing’s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, wrote on Twitter that the virus may have originated from the US Army, which took part in Military World Games in Wuhan last October. In response, the US summoned China’s Washington ambassador Cui Tiankai this week to complain about the tweet. \n In posts on the social media platform, which is banned in China, Zhao also shared articles from the Canadian conspiracy site Global Research that suggested Covid-19 had originated in the US. \n At Wednesday’s media conference, Mr Trump demurred when asked about a CBS reporter’s Twitter post on Tuesday that a White House official had referred to the virus as “Kung Flu” during a private conversation. “No, not at all,” he said when asked if the term put Asian-Americans at risk. “They probably would agree with it 100 per cent, it comes from China.” \n Mr Trump also said he had no plans to ease tariffs on China, amid calls for him to do so by American industry groups. “China is paying us billions and billions of dollars in tariffs, and there's no reason to do that. They haven't even spoken to me about that,” the president said. \n The press conference – the third consecutive daily briefing fronted by Mr Trump — saw a continuation of his dramatic shift of tone regarding the virus, after weeks of downplaying its severity. “We're going to defeat the invisible enemy, I think we're going to do it even faster than we thought,” Mr Trump said. “And it will be a complete victory. It'll be a total victory.” \n The president’s comments came as already-strained ties between the two superpowers further soured this week, with both sides trading barbs — and conspiracy theories — over who was ultimately responsible for the spread of the coronavirus. \n China has reacted with fury at Trump’s and his Republican allies’ insistence on calling the ailment the “Chinese coronavirus” or the “Wuhan virus”. \n Those names ignore the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) repeated calls for all countries to use the officially assigned terminology — Covid-19 for the disease, and SARS-CoV-2 for the virus that causes the illness. \n While epidemics’ names in the past had been based on where most of the infections occurred, the WHO in 2015 issued new guidelines to avoid contagions being identified by geography; the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome was one such example. \n The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus in a statement on Tuesday said referring to Covid-19 as the “Chinese virus” was akin to “telling people who to blame, they are telling people who to fear and who to hate”. \n “Unfortunately, we have already seen how this bigotry has impacted Asian-Americans across the country who are facing increased prejudice and violence,” the group said, adding that many from the community had been assaulted to the point of requiring medical care in hospitals. \n “This is the consequence of spreading xenophobia, something that cannot continue to be amplified by the Trump administration and Republican members. Not now, not ever.” \n China, too, has fanned diplomatic flames. In recent weeks, with the outbreak easing across the mainland, senior diplomatic officials have parroted the theory that the virus did not originate in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, as has been widely presumed by scientists. \n Beijing also provoked anger in Washington on Tuesday when it moved to expel at least 13 American journalists from China by revoking their visas in retaliation for Washington’s move last month to curb the number of journalist visas it issued to staff from five Chinese state-owned media outlets. \n The Chinese action affects journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal. \n Asked for reaction to the journalists’ impending expulsion, Mr Trump — who frequently disparages “fake news” outlets he does not like — said: “I am not happy to see it. I have my own disputes with all three of those media groups. I think you know that very well, but I don't like seeing that at all.” SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "北京——美国总统特朗普周三（3月18日）双倍减少了他最近使用“中国病毒”一词来指代Covid-19，他说他只是指病毒的来源地，这个表达不是种族主义。\n为了表示对中国人使用这个词的愤怒的蔑视，总统在其Covid-19特别工作组的每日记者招待会开始后的几秒钟内使用了这个词，他说：“在我们抗击中国病毒的战争中有一些重要的进展。”。\n“不，不，这根本不是种族主义……它来自中国，”特朗普在被问到为什么在越来越多的针对华裔美国人的种族主义报道中使用这个词时表示。\n“我非常爱我们国家的所有人，但是，你知道，中国曾经试图说……这是美国士兵造成的。那是不可能的。这不会发生的，只要我是总统。它来自中国，”特朗普表示。\n当再次被问及是否确定该病毒来自中国时，他说：“不必想，我知道。”。\n上周四，北京外交部发言人赵立坚在推特上写道，病毒可能来自去年10月在武汉参加世界军事运动会的美军。对此，美国本周召见了中国驻华盛顿大使崔天凯，对这条微博表示不满。\n在中国被禁止的社交媒体平台的帖子中，赵亮还分享了加拿大阴谋网站Global Research的文章，认为Covid-19起源于美国。\n在周三的媒体会议上，特朗普在周二被问及哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）一名记者在推特上的帖子时表示反对，称白宫一名官员在一次私人谈话中称该病毒为“公流感”。“不，一点也不，”当被问及这个词是否会让亚裔美国人处于危险中时，他说. “他们可能会百分之百同意这一点，因为它来自中国。”\n特朗普还表示，他没有放松对中国关税的计划，因为美国工业团体要求他这样做。“中国正在向美国支付数十亿美元的关税，没有理由这样做。他们甚至都没和我谈过这件事，”总统说。\n这次记者招待会是特朗普连续第三次出席每日简报会，在数周轻描淡写病毒严重性之后，特朗普对病毒的态度继续发生戏剧性转变。特朗普表示：“我们将击败隐形敌人，我认为我们将以比想象中更快的速度完成这项任务。”。“这将是一场彻底的胜利。这将是一场彻底的胜利。”\n奥巴马发表上述言论之际，两个超级大国之间本已紧张的关系本周进一步恶化，双方围绕谁是冠状病毒传播的最终责任展开了激烈的交锋——以及阴谋论。\n中国对特朗普和他的共和党盟友坚持将这种疾病称为“中国冠状病毒”或“武汉病毒”的做法做出了愤怒的反应。\n这些名字忽视了世界卫生组织（WHO）一再呼吁所有国家使用官方指定的术语Covid-19来表示疾病，SARS-CoV-2则表示导致疾病的病毒。\n虽然过去流行病的名称是根据大多数感染发生的地方命名的，但世卫组织在2015年发布了新的指南，以避免按地理位置确定传染病；中东呼吸综合征就是这样一个例子。\n美国国会亚太裔核心小组周二发表声明称，将Covid-19称为“中国病毒”类似于“告诉人们该责怪谁，他们在告诉人们该害怕谁，该恨谁”。\n该组织说：“不幸的是，我们已经看到这种偏见是如何影响到美国各地的亚裔美国人的，他们正面临着越来越多的偏见和暴力。”该组织还说，来自社区的许多人受到攻击，以至于需要在医院接受医疗护理。\n“这是排外情绪蔓延的后果，特朗普政府和共和党成员无法继续放大这种情绪。现在不行，永远不行。”\n中国也煽起了外交火焰。近几周来，随着疫情在大陆各地的缓解，高级外交官员驳斥了病毒并非源自中国中部城市武汉的说法，科学家们普遍认为这一说法。\n北京周二也在华盛顿激起了愤怒，北京撤销了至少13名美国记者的签证，以报复华盛顿上个月采取的限制向5家中国国有媒体员工发放记者签证的行动。\n中国的行动影响到《纽约时报》、《华盛顿邮报》和《华尔街日报》的记者。\n当被问及对记者即将被驱逐出境的反应时，特朗普——他经常诋毁自己不喜欢的“假新闻”媒体——说：“我不高兴看到它。我和这三家媒体都有自己的争议。我想你很清楚，但我一点也不喜欢看这部电影。《南华早报》",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Amid all the panic buying, social distancing, toilet paper brawling, vacay cancelling, it turns out that there is an unexpected twist of events that is the Covid-19 crisis. A good one. Yes, really. \n Air pollution has drastically declined in countries like Italy and China. Experts have found a direct correlation between mass lockdowns in cities (and the subsequent slowdown in human activity) and improved air quality. It’s a silver lining, albeit a bittersweet one. But in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic, we’ll take this, thankyouverymuch. \n The usually-murky waters in Venice’s canals are looking crystal clear once again, as Twitter and Instagram users began noticing just one week after the nationwide lockdown was enforced. \n On any given day, pre-coronavirus, these waters in the UNESCO heritage site are usually clogged with gondolas, vaporetti (water buses), ferries, other boats… and, of course, tourists. According to reports, the average month of March would see an influx of about 700,000 tourists. \n But of course, we’re living in 2020 and this isn’t a regular month of March. Italy, which has seen the most number of people infected with Covid-19 outside of China, has been under total lockdown since Mar 9. Venice is just outside of the Lombardy region, which is the hardest hit area in the country. \n   \n This is a rare sight in the UNESCO heritage site that has been battling overtourism for years. Twitter user @IngridFalasteen, who posted pictures (above, extreme right) on Mar 17, noted: “Venice today with never before seen crystal clear water in the last 60 years, just after six days of quarantine. \n Other Italian publications have noted that this has “brought back the lagoon waters of ancient times, those of the post-war period, when it was even still possible to bathe in the waters of the canals.” \n Local authorities have clarified that this does not mean that water quality has improved — sediments are still present in the waters, but are staying at the bottom. “It's because there is less boat traffic that usually brings sediment to the top of the water's surface,” a spokesman had told CNN. \n   \n But there’s still an upside to this: air quality in Venice has indeed improved. New satellite data shows that nitrogen dioxide emissions in Italy have drastically decreased, especially in the northern part of the country. This is good news for Venice. After all, the UNESCO World Heritage Site has been battling with overtourism, and last November, its worst floods since 1966, caused by climate change. \n Air pollution in China, the epicentre of the outbreak, has also fallen drastically between January and February, as Chinese cities shuttered businesses and went into lockdown and social isolation. Satellite images from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) show that there’s been a significant reduction in nitrogen dioxide in the air, emitted by motor vehicles, power plants and industrial facilities. The improvement in air quality corresponds to the slowdown in human activities in the country.  \n Not far away in Hongkong, air pollution has been cut by one-third from January to February, according to studies by the Hong Kong University School of Public Health. In busy areas such as Mongkok, Causeway Bay and Central, PM2.5 particle pollutants reduced by 32 per cent. This has a direct correlation to the HK government’s measures to get people to start working from home, thus significantly reducing the amount of traffic, as well as the closures of public facilities and the lockdown in mainland China.  \n Photos: Unsplash, Twitter, Instagram \n ",

This is really a terrible blow to the economies of the whole world.” \n While the 1997 crisis affected millions of people as economies contracted and currencies plunged, Malaysia was better off, rebounding economically in just one year. \n Much of it was credited to Dr Mahathir who was the architect of Malaysia’s capital controls in 1998. \n “This time, pegging the exchange rate won’t help. \n “Investor confidence is very low not only for Malaysia, it’s for the whole world,” he was quoted as saying. \n “Because if you invest and you cannot sell, you don’t invest.” \n After a recent political crisis, Mr Muhyiddin Yassin is now the prime minister. \n However, Dr Mahathir said he has doubt over the new government’s ability to steer the country to recovery. \n “This is the wrong time to take over the government. \n “The country has never been in such a state before.” \n Other world leaders have also issued similar warnings. \n European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde had said the economic fallout could be as bad as the 2008 global financial crisis, while Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the pandemic economic fallout might be worse. \n On Sunday (March 15), 190 new Covid-19 cases had been confirmed in Malaysia alone, the largest single-day increase in the number of confirmed cases. \n Meanwhile, China has logged more than 80,800 cases, but most patients have recovered and there are now fewer than 10,000 infected people. \n The country’s progress contrasts with the growing crisis abroad, with the worldwide death toll surpassing 6,000 as Italy recorded its biggest one-day rise in fatalities. \n With 368 deaths, Italy’s grim figure was higher than any single-day toll reported in China.

The countries subject to the new restrictions are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  \n - Travellers from the United Kingdom, Ireland and more than a dozen Eastern and Southeastern Europe nations will exempted. Those countries do not participate in the Schengen Area's passport-free travel.  \n - The restrictions will not apply to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, or to spouses, parents and children under the age of 21 of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, among other exceptions.  \n - Flights from the affected European nations will be funnelled to 13 airports in the United States that serve 90 percent of existing European flights, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official. Boston Logan International Airport and Miami International Airport will be added to a list of 11 airports that have been receiving incoming flights from China and Iran since early February.  \n - At the same time, U.S. airports are cutting flights. Delta Air Lines said Friday it plans to suspend all flights to and from continental Europe for 30 days - a suspension that could start as early as Sunday.  \n - The United States is preparing for thousands of new coronavirus cases and will ask Americans returning from the affected European countries to go into self-quarantine for 14 days as part of the effort to contain the outbreak, Vice President Mike Pence said on Thursday.  \n - Travellers coming from the targeted European countries will be subjected to enhanced entry screening upon arrival in the United States, DHS said in a statement on Friday. During that screening, they will be asked about their medical history, current condition, and contact information, which will be supplied to local health authorities, according to DHS. They will be given written guidance about COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, and told to self-quarantine at home, the agency said.  \n - President Donald Trump's proclamation on Wednesday said the Schengen countries had the highest rate of coronavirus infection outside of China, and that \"the free flow of people between the Schengen Area countries makes the task of managing the spread of the virus difficult.\"  \n - A key question is - What is to stop people from the Schengen region from travelling to the United States via Britain? Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, said while Britain maintains entry and exit records for all travellers, it does not regularly share that information with the United States.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Mattia went to a hospital in the city of Codogno in northern Italy, the 20th of February. The Covid-19 test came back positive, and this 38 year manager at Unilever became the first Italian patient of the coronavirus. This Monday, the social assistance advisor from the Lombardy region, Giulio Gallera, announced that Mattia \"began to breathe autonomously\" and left intensive care at Pavia Hospital where she is still. According to the newspaper La Repubblica, his wife, eight months pregnant, has returned home.\nDespite the favourable development of the first confirmed patient, Italy became within a few days the second country with the largest number of cases and deaths associated with the new coronavirus worldwide, after China. According to most recent data, there are nine.172 cases in Italy and 463 dead. In mainland China, cases and three.136 dead are still counted to date 80.754. Overall, the number of cases exceeds the 113 thousand, the number of deaths of four thousand and almost a thousand recoveries.\nAlmost a month before the outbreak began, the Italian Ministry of Health had already set up a mission group and suspended all flights to and from China declaring a state of emergency. Weeks before Mattia tested positive, Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan had studied three different genetic sequences found in the Lombardy region, confirming Covid-19. So how is it that the increase in the number of cases and deaths was explosive in what is by far the most serious situation in Europe?\nOne clue pointed out in the Italian press is that the virus arrived in Italy before the travel baYeah. \"It is possible that when Covid-19 arrived in the country, it was still in incubation and that the infection developed in someone with mild or no symptoms,\" explained the head of the department of infectious diseases of that hospital in Milan, Massimo Galli, to the newspaper Corriere della Sera.\nAnadolu Agency/Getty Images\nAt the end of December an unusual number of pneumonia cases came to Codogno hospital, the same as Mattia went to in February, according to the head of the emergency unit, Stefano Paglia, to La Repubblica. Some of these patients may have been coronavirus carriers, being treated as if they were suffering from a typical winter disease.\nThe hospital itself will have been instrumental in spreading the virus, due to the continuous circulation of medical staff and patients every day. \"The hospital acted as a multiplier\", acknowledged Walter Ricciardi, a member of the Executive Board of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and a consultant to the Italian Ministry of Health, in statements to Al Jazeera.\nSeveral experts attribute the initial chaos to the lack of a unified contingency plan in all regions of the country involving public and private hospitals. Protective custody indicates the average age of coronavirus deaths is 81,4 years old. In fact, experts say that the virus is particularly dangerous for the elderly and for people with weaker health conditions.\nQuestioned by the Italian case express, WHO communications consultant Stephanie Brickman preferred to start by taking a more global approach. \"Cases of Covid-19 are increasing due to imports and some local spread. As contacts of infected people are tracked and more and more people are subjected to tests, the number of cases increases. When a person dies from Covid-19, the moment of infection usually occurred two weeks earlier, so the increase in deaths is unfortunately a sign of the evolution of the outbreak\", underlineYeah.\nThe latest figures released in China and South Korea se em to indicate that the virus may be under control, or in the process of being, in northeast Asia, even though in the first case in February, explosive growth has already occurred overnight. But even if this trend of containment is confirmed in that region of the globe, cases in Europe and North America are rapidly expanding.\nSubject to the most restrictive measures since World War II, the entire Italian population is under quarantine. When announcing the extension of measures of a considerable stain from the north to the whole territory, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte declared that \"all Italy will be a protected area\". \"There's no time. The contagion is increasing,\"he added. It is the \"good of Italy\" that is at stake, he further stated, stating, \"The habits must be changed. Stay home.\"\nAnadolu Agency/Getty Images\nThe Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has already praised what he described as \"genuine sacrifices\" of Italians. According to the Government, the restrictive measures will be in force by the third of April. The Executive promised to further increase spending on a \"mass shock therapy\" to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus. But, through his Home Secretary, Luciana Lamorgese, also warned: anyone who leaves the \"containment regions\" risks three months'imprisonment and a fine up to 206 euros.\n\"There is evidence that the containment measures adopted in China slowed the outbreak. A number of interventions will be needed to help slow the spread, including improvements in respiratory and hand hygiene and self-isolation for those who are not well and who have acute respiratory diseases,\"says Stephanie Brickman. \"The WHO is always available for advice but ultimately Member States take decisions according to their own cultural situations and contexts,\" he addedYeah.\nIn protest of the suspension of visits, another of the virus propagation measures, six prisoners from a Modena chain have died, as reported this Monday by prison Director Francesco Basentini. The prisoners occupied the entire prison, including a infirmary, where they took over several drugs, including methadone, and set a cell block on fire. Two of them died of an overdose and one as a result of smoke inhalation. The cause of death of the other three is under investigation. The Ministry of Justice has announced that in several other prisons prisoners have mutinied upon learning of visits being suspended.\nThe WHO leader heard by the Express leaves the message:'What is happening in Italy will be an important learning experience for Europe. Other countries may face similar situations in the near future.",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The new coronavirus killed 1,4% of infected people in Wuhan, China, according to a study published today, which also highlights the increase in mortality rates with age. According to the researchers of the study published in the scientific journal \"Nature Medicine\", the number of confirmed cases is probably much lower than the number of people actually infected, due to the limited ability to carry out mass tests, and therefore also the actual mortality will be lower in relation to official numbers.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) advanced last week that the mortality rate of the virus is in the 3,4%, but according to the study, the likelihood of dying after the development of Covid-19 symptoms is 1,4%.\nLooking at the epicenter of the pandemic, the Chinese city of Wuhan, the team of Chinese researchers believes they have developed a better estimate of the lethality of the new coronavirus, supported by various public and private databases that include indicators such as confirmed cases unrelated to the market where the outbreak occurred, the confirmed air passenger cases and the profile of confirmed cases and deaths.\n\"Estimating the actual number of cases is a challenge for an overburdened health system, which cannot indicate the number of cases for sure\", writes the researchers. Until February 29, mainland China had 79.394 confirmed cases and 2.838 deaths (3,5% mortality among positive cases), most of which in Wuhan.\nHowever, the authors believe that many of the less serious cases have not been accounted for, therefore, considering that their methodology for estimating Covid-19 mortality is more appropriate, since it includes an estimate of the actual number of casesYeah. According to the research team, the number of deaths \"depends mainly on the severity of the symptoms developed by an infected person and that is the problem that must be at the centre of attention\".\nThe study led by Joseph Wu, virologist at the University of Hong Kong, also analysed the relationship between age and mortality. According to the results, people over five years old are more than five times more likely to die than those of age between 30 and 59. On the other hand, those less than 30 years are 0.6 times less likely (60%) to die than the previous group. The risk of developing moderate to severe symptoms increases by about four% every year in the age group between 30 and 60 years.\n\"Estimates of observed and unobserved infections are essential for the development and evaluation of public health strategies, which must be balanced against economic, social and individual freedom costs, writes the researcher, adding that these new data are particularly important for Europe, now at the epicentre of the pandemic.\nThe new coronavirus, responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic, infected over 231 thousand people around the world, of whom more than nine.350 died. More than 86.250 people have recovered from the disease. After appearing in China in December, the outbreak has already spread to 177 countries and territories, leading the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare a pandemic situation.\nChina, for its part, announced this Thursday that it had not experienced new local infections in the last 24-hour period, which is the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic. However, it recorded 34 new imported cases.\nIn total, since the outbreak began last December, the authorities of mainland China, excluding Macao and Hong Kong, have accounted for diagnosed infections 80.894, including 69.614 cases that have already recovered, while the total death has settled in the 3.237Yeah.\nIn Portugal, the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) has today elevated the number of confirmed cases of infection to 785, 143 more than on Wednesday. In the bulletin released by the DGS, three people were killed, but in the meantime, the Ovar Chamber has announced a fourth fatality.\nOf the confirmed cases, 696 are recovering at home and 89 are admitted, 20 of which in Intensive Care Units (ICU). DGS reports 6.061 suspicious cases to this day, of which 488 were awaiting lab results. Of the infected people in Portugal, three recovered.\nAccording to the bulletin, there are eight.091 contacts in surveillance by the health authorities.

        "news_content_translate_en": "HONG KONG — As the coronavirus continues to spread around the world, China has one important lesson for other governments in fighting the disease — be prepared to pay so that patients won't let costs deter them from getting tests and treatment. \n The coronavirus — which causes a disease called Covid-19 — has spread to more than 100 countries, with Italy, Iran and South Korea emerging as growing epicentres of the epidemic. \n Italy has reported more than 10,000 cases of infection, overtaking South Korea as the worst affected country outside China. The United States has also begun to report more confirmed cases as health authorities cleared some restrictions that had limited the availability of testing for the contagion. \n But in China, where the disease was first reported, the epidemic is waning, with 24 new cases of infection reported on Wednesday (March 11). \n A coronavirus test reportedly costs about 370 yuan (S$74) in China. And in the southern city of Shenzhen, the average cost of treating the disease ranged from 23,000 yuan for elderly patients to about 5,600 yuan for minors, the Chinese Hospital Management journal reported on Feb 28. \n Some of the country's treatment methods such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation — which artificially oxygenates a patient's blood for a limited period of time — are expensive but they are all covered by the government, which has earmarked 110.48 billion yuan for treatment, subsidies for medical staff and medical equipment. \n In the US, where there have been 25 deaths among 696 confirmed cases, public anxiety is growing over the cost of testing. \n The US government does not charge for coronavirus confirmation tests at designated laboratories but a trip to the hospital will incur other hefty expenses, in one case over US$3,200 (S$4,448). Insurance lobby group America's Health Insurance Plans said individuals needed to check their insurance providers for coverage of costs related to Covid-19. \n As of Monday, only 1,707 people had been tested by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. More tests may have been conducted at lower level public health laboratories but the number of infections could also be bigger, according to a new Cedars-Sinai study, which estimated that between 1,043 and 9,484 people in the US may have been infected by March 1. \n South Korea, with more than 7,700 Covid-19 patients as of Wednesday, announced in January that the government and insurance companies would cover the expenses associated with examination, isolation and treatment for coronavirus patients. The country has greatly expanded testing stations to include drive-through services and tested about 15,000 people a day. \n Japan designated Covid-19 as an infectious disease in February, making it the government's responsibility to pay inpatient bills related to the coronavirus infection. \n In Britain, about 18,000 people have received free testing since last month, and 382 have been confirmed as infected as of Wednesday. \n Professor Dirk Pfeiffer, chair professor of One Health at City University's Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, said affordability would hinder the epidemic control efforts. \n \"Clearly, wherever you have to pay for health care, individuals with mild symptoms in the lower-income groups will hesitate to visit a health care facility, and that may also be the case in some individuals with severe disease. These behaviours will extend the epidemic,\" Mr Pfeiffer said. \n But he said aggressive testing was not realistic in most countries and social distancing would continue to be the most important risk mitigation measure. \n \"I don't think large-scale testing is realistic in most countries because of the sheer number of tests required. And even where it is feasible, it will not eradicate the virus from the population. Therefore, testing would have to remain risk-based, focusing, for example, on those in contact with known cases,\" he said. \n Mr Pfeiffer said that in Western democratic societies, social distancing would be based mostly on voluntary compliance in contrast to China where tests were mandatory under the country's infectious disease control regulations. \n \"The consequence of this difference will be that the epidemic will take longer in the countries where social distancing is voluntary,\" he said. \n Mr Ni Feng, director of the Institute of American Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said China and the US had different conditions and it was understandable they used different strategies, but China's success in bringing the epidemic under control could be a good opportunity for both countries to work together. \n \"This is the least-sensitive area. There are many fields where the two countries can cooperate. We saw some solid cooperation in the past with Sars, H5N1 and H7N9 aviation influenza outbreaks, but not this time,\" Mr Ni said.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — There are now 17 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infections from the latest cluster involving a private function at Safra Jurong, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (March 6). \n Of these, nine cases were among the 13 new Covid-19 infections that were reported on Friday — the highest number of cases reported in a day so far. \n HOW MANY PEOPLE ATTENDED THE EVENT? \n Speaking to reporters, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services at MOH, said that the authorities do not yet know the exact number of guests who were present at the dinner function on Feb 15. \n In a statement on Thursday, Safra said that the event was held at the Joy Garden Restaurant on its premises, which was then closed for cleaning from Feb 16 to 19. All visitors had their temperatures checked and were required to make declarations about their recent travel history, it added. \n “They did not have fever or exhibited any flu-like symptoms. They also did not have any recent travel history to mainland China within the past 14 days of their visit to the club as stated within their declaration,” Safra said. \n Assoc Prof Mak added that investigations are ongoing to assess how many people attended the dinner and which people might have had close contact with individuals who the authorities now know to have infections. \n WHAT KIND OF EVENT WAS IT?  \n Associate Professor Vernon Lee, director of communicable diseases at MOH, said that the private event was a sit-down dinner and a social event organised by a couple of individuals for friends and their other family members. \n Assoc Prof Mak said that people were seated at more than one table, and they were moving around the private function room throughout the dinner. \n WHY DID IT TAKE A WHILE TO FIND LINKS? \n Not all of the 17 confirmed cases from the cluster at Safra Jurong attended the private dinner function, Assoc Prof Mak said. Some of the infected people linked to the cluster were not present, but were family members of those who had attended the function. \n It took “some time” to establish how the infected people in the cluster were linked, he said. \n This came only after extensive recording, investigations of the movements of the infected people and contact tracing. Then the authorities were able to identify the activity that the confirmed cases had in common — that is, the private function at Safra Jurong. \n Assoc Prof Mak added that the authorities had to interview these individuals, trying to find out what their movements were, assessing who they had come into contact with and then interviewing those other people as well. \n “That takes time. And this explains why it is taking so long to establish the various people involved, to also make a diagnosis on these individuals as well,” he said, adding that contact tracing and investigations are continuing. \n Assoc Prof Mak warned that there is a possibility that more cases linked to this cluster will emerge over the next few days. \n WHY ARE SOME CASES ONLY EMERGING NOW? \n A number of cases from the Safra Jurong cluster presented themselves to the authorities “days after they were symptomatic”, Assoc Prof Mak said. \n Some of the infected people continued with social activities and went to work despite having respiratory symptoms, he added. \n “We’ve always been telling members of the public that if you are sick, please don’t mix around, (don’t) continue with your social activities (or) work activities. If you are sick, see a doctor early and isolate.”  \n When people do not heed the call to not go out to gatherings when they have flu-symptoms or are sick, it makes it harder to contain the disease and \"exposes other people who otherwise would have been well to the Covid-19 infection\", he said. \n \"And this thus makes our task even more challenging in trying to identify who the close contacts might be, and then isolating them and putting them on surveillance.” \n Assoc Prof Lee emphasised the same point: “It is all a cluster, as a result of someone symptomatic who went for the event. \n “So, as long as people adhere to these social responsibilities and don’t go around when they are ill, then we can see that this entire incident would not have happened.” \n Asked what had been done to the identified attendees at the private function, Assoc Prof Lee explained that it had been more than 14 days since the event took place, so only those who reported that they were unwell had to go to the hospital for checks. \n “Those who were well throughout would not have been quarantined because they had already passed that 14-day exposure period,” he said. \n WHO ELSE ARE LINKED TO THE CLUSTER? \n Aside from the nine newly confirmed cases on Friday, eight other cases reported previously have been linked to the cluster at Safra Jurong. \n They are: Case 96, a Year 1 Raffles Institution student, who is linked to Case 94, a 64-year-old Singaporean woman who is then linked to Case 112, an assistant cook at Creative O Preschoolers’ Bay. None of the cases has recently travelled to China, or Daegu city or Cheongdo county in South Korea. \n Case 107, a 68-year-old Singaporean woman, was in Jakarta, Indonesia from Feb 11 to 14, while Case 117, a 52-year-old Singaporean woman, was in Malaysia on March 1. \n Other cases linked to the Safra Jurong cluster are Cases 114, 115 and 116 who were confirmed on Thursday. \n WHAT PRECAUTIONS DID SAFRA JURONG TAKE?  \n In a statement on its website on Thursday, Safra said that the individuals who had attended the private dinner function and who then tested positive for Covid-19 had cleared mandatory temperature checks it had conducted. \n It said that all visitors and employees at Safra Jurong had undergone temperature checks which had been introduced in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, along with other measures such as increased cleaning and disinfection of facilities. \n All visitors have to make declarations about their travel history and to provide contact details, the statement added. \n In a Facebook post early on Friday, Safra said that the restaurant, along with all other possible areas which might have been visited by the affected individuals, was to be “thoroughly cleaned and disinfected again starting (March 6)”. \n In a separate Facebook post, Safra Jurong said that the restaurant will be closed from March 6 to 12. \n ",

China's economic fundamentals remain robust and consumer spending and production have only been delayed, he said.  \n \"Hopefully across the nation we'll see a strong rebound in the not-too-distant future,\" he said.  \n The comments come as the number of new daily infections from the COVID-19 virus is increasing outside of China faster than inside, and that follows crippling Chinese restrictions imposed to stop its spread, including transport suspensions and the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday.  \n Mainland China had 119 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, the National Health Commission said, down from 125 the previous day, in a broad trend that has seen numbers of new cases fall from the middle of February.  \n \"After several weeks of fighting against this disease, the message is that COVID-19 is a virus that can be contained,\" Peiwu said. \"It's a common challenge. We have to fight against the disease together.\"  \n Canada has only seen about 30 cases so far, and no deaths. Peiwu praised the country for not over-reacting and being \"clear-headed and evidence based\", while Beijing has accused the United States of scaremongering for its quick evacuations and travel restrictions.  \n However, Canada's measured reaction has not paved the way for a resolution to the long-running dispute between the two nations, which started in December 2018 when Canadian police arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, on a U.S. arrest warrant.  \n Shortly afterward, Beijing detained two Canadian men who were later charged for spying and are still being held.  \n \"Of course, there's still an outstanding issue between the two countries,\" Peiwu said.  \n The first phase of the legal battle over whether Meng should be extradited to the United States wrapped up in January. China has repeatedly demanded that Ottawa release her, but the Canadian government says it will not interfere in the judicial process.  \n \"It's our consistent hope that the Canadian side will make the right decision,\" the ambassador said.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Some health experts are saying that patients cured of the Covid-19 disease are unlikely to get reinfected, although they cannot say for sure exactly what is causing some discharged patients in the Chinese city of Wuhan to test positive again for the coronavirus.  \n Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist from the Mount Elizabeth Novena Specialist Centre, offered a theory: Wuhan patients who have been discharged are likely those who have recovered from their illness but were not tested negative for the virus.  \n Over the weekend, reports have emerged that some discharged patients in Wuhan have tested positive again, prompting the authorities there to introduce a 14-day mandatory quarantine for Covid-19 patients who have recovered.  \n From last Saturday (Feb 22), all patients in Wuhan who had recovered and were discharged have to be sent to designated places for two weeks of quarantine and medical observation, the city's coronavirus treatment and control command centre said on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. \n The Covid-19 outbreak began in Wuhan from China’s Hubei province, and has now spread to 36 other countries and territories, including Singapore, which confirmed 91 cases as of noon on Tuesday (Feb 25).  \n Other countries such as South Korea, Japan and Iran are also seeing jumps in the number of new cases daily.  \n The virus, which can cause severe pneumonia and acute respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath and cough,  has infected more than 80,000 individuals globally and killed more than 2,700, most of them Chinese nationals.  \n DOES A RECOVERED PATIENT DEVELOP IMMUNITY? \n The health experts interviewed by TODAY said that reinfection among discharged Covid-19 patients is unlikely, although they said it is too early to determine the reasons why it happened.   \n Taking reference from how the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2002 and 2003 behaved, Dr Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said: “We found high levels of immunity in recovered Sars patients and this is likely to be the case with Covid-19.” \n Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, who heads the infectious diseases programme at the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, agrees that patients infected with other coronaviruses do develop an immunity after an infection.  \n “(The immunity) lasts for at least a few years, although this immunity does not appear to be lifelong,” he said.  \n However, Assoc Prof Hsu said that it is not yet known whether Covid-19 would behave in the same manner because not enough time has lapsed for more research to be done on the virus yet. \n Offering his view on the matter is Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the World Health Organization’s research policy and cooperation department in Geneva. \n He said that a discharged patient who tests positive again could be either a reactivation or reinfection.  \n “Both are possible and hard to differentiate. Some viruses remain dormant but can reappear,” Prof Pangestu said.  \n Emeritus Professor Duane Gubler at the Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School said that not enough is known about this virus to know what kind of immune response infected individuals develop.  \n “We need serological tests to help determine what kind, how much and the duration of protective antibodies.” \n WHAT COULD BE CAUSING THE POSITIVE TESTS? \n Health experts told TODAY that there could be several reasons why discharged patients get tested positive again. These include inaccurate tests being done or patients not being tested to confirm that they are free of the virus before being discharged. \n Emeritus Prof Gubler said that false positive results are not uncommon with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that is now being used for Covid-19.  \n A second set of primers — single strands of DNA or RNA, which stands for ribonucleic acid — that are based on a different part of the genome should be used for quality control, he added. \n RNA carries genetic information, enabling the tests to pinpoint organisms such as viruses. \n The PCR test could also have detected viral RNA that is not infectious but that can persist for various periods of time, Emeritus Prof Gubler said. \n “It is possible for detectable RNA to be present even though the patient has recovered clinically but is no longer infectious.” \n Dr Leong said one possibility is that Wuhan hospitals discharge Covid-19 patients who seem well but are not completely cleared of the virus.  \n “If you look at Singapore’s data on coronavirus, some people stay in hospital for 28 days not because they are sick for 28 days. They stay for 28 days but maybe sick for 10 to 14 days. \n “As for the rest of time, they are waiting for the test to turn out negative. Singapore hospitals make sure it is negative twice before they are being discharged,” Dr Leong explained.  \n In China, a need for hospital beds, as well as a lack of PCR testing equipment could have pushed the authorities to adopt this procedure of discharging patients who have not been tested negative for the virus.  \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — While scientists continue to learn more about the Covid-19 coronavirus, a question that is often asked is this: Why do some people die from an infection but then there are others such as Singapore’s 76th patient — a one-year-old baby who recovered in just two days — who have mild or no symptoms?    \n The answer, experts said, might possibly hinge on a person's immune defences. \n Researchers are still unclear exactly how this new coronavirus interacts with the human body's immune system, but from reports that have come up, around 80 per cent of the infected cases recover but the rest grapple with severe or critical symptoms. \n An estimated 2.3 per cent die from it, based a new study published in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology that looked at more than 72,000 cases of Covid-19 infection in China as of Feb 11.  \n The study by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention showed that for those aged 80 and above, the fatality rate is harrowing — at 14.8 per cent. \n HOW DOES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM WORK? \n Our immune system kicks in when it encounters a threat, such as a virus, bacteria or parasite. Yet, it is common to see differing immune responses to the same microbe — even among family members. \n Paediatric immunology specialist Liew Woei Kang is the medical director of the Paediatric Allergy Immunology Rheumatology Centre at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. He said that there is an interplay between a person's genes and environmental factors that determine the immune system and its response to infection. \n This means that lifestyle factors such as how you live, what you eat, how much exercise you get and your medical history could possibly make a difference between life and death in the face of an infection. \n The immune system is made up of a complex network of organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes, immune cells as well as molecules that can be activated to defend against threats to the body. \n Associate Professor Liu Haiyan said that the body’s first line of defence in response to an infection is the barrier function, which includes the skin and mucosal surfaces — the inner lining of some organs and body cavities such as the nose, mouth, lungs, stomach and intestines. \n Assoc Prof Liu is from the department of microbiology and immunology at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine in the National University of Singapore. \n Like many respiratory infections, Covid-19 is believed to be spread mostly through droplets emitted from an infected person, such as when the person coughs or sneezes. \n Someone may become infected if the droplets come into contact with the mucous membranes in the eyes, nose or mouth. Transmission may also occur when people touch their eyes, nose or mouth by hands exposed to the virus. \n This is also why medical experts have been saying that good personal hygiene is important in preventing infections, because viruses would have to get into the body to cause disease. \n The immune system then initiates an early response (called innate immune response), during which immune cells can be activated within a short period of time. However, this early response is usually not enough to deal with an infection, Assoc Prof Liu said. \n “We need the activation of our adaptive immune response, which takes about three days (after the early response is initiated). \n “Lymphocytes (one of the types of white blood cells) are the main cell types responding at this stage. Some of them can kill viral infected cells and some can make antibodies that help clear the infection.” \n WHAT IS A HEALTHY IMMUNE SYSTEM AND HOW DOES IT DEVELOP? \n Assoc Prof Liu said that there are no known medications or vaccine for new pathogens such as Covid-19 for now, so people would heavily depend on their immune systems to fight the infection. \n She defines a healthy immune system as one that is “balanced and targeted” and can generate a specific response to infections. And it does this without inducing much damage to the body’s own tissues and organs. \n “People who can generate a more efficient anti-viral immune response have milder symptoms when they encounter an infection,” she said. \n She explained that the immune system starts to function from birth but also goes through different stages in a lifetime. \n Expanding on this, Dr Liew said: “At birth, babies are partly protected by antibodies from their mothers, transferred via the placenta in the last few weeks of pregnancy. Premature babies have lower immunity levels.\" \n After birth, the immune system “gets educated” by encounters with various microbes, including infections, probiotics and vaccinations, he said. \n The immune system is possibly most primed — or ready for “battle”— in childhood and then matures in adulthood, he added. \n WHY DO CHILDREN HAVE 'MILDER' COVID-19 INFECTIONS? \n If a young immune system is not fully matured, why do children seem to have less severe forms of Covid-19 infection? \n Associate Professor Thoon Koh Cheng of KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) said that the effects of the new coronavirus on children seems to share some similarities with the one that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2003. \n “In our previous experience with Sars, patients who are 12 years of age or younger had milder disease. The younger children were also less likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit or receive supplemental oxygen.” \n Assoc Prof Thoon, who is head and senior consultant of infectious disease service at the hospital’s department of paediatrics, said that based on what doctors know so far, if the virus infects a healthy child, he or she should make a good recovery with good medical support. \n “Milder symptoms are also observed in children infected with the coronavirus compared to older people.” \n Dr Liew offered several possible hypotheses for this. One of them may be due to children’s many recent encounters with infections including the common human coronavirus, which offer some cross-protection. \n For instance, it is common for children to get one to two infections a month in the first six months of starting school — due to a combination of poor hygiene habits (such as children sneezing and coughing into one another) and viruses circulating within air-conditioned confined spaces, he said. \n There are several common human coronaviruses already known that cause symptoms such runny nose, sore throat, headache, fever and cough. \n Dr Liew explained: “While a child’s immune system is young, the ‘soldiers’ are ready. In contrast, an adult’s immune system may have experience with previous infection encounters, but because the last illness may have been a while back, the immune system may not be as battle-ready.” \n An adult’s immune system may also be senescent (ageing) or dysregulated (not functioning normally), causing an exaggerated immune response. \n “The severe Covid-19 cases in intensive care and deaths are often not due to the virus, but an exaggerated response to the virus. This results in excessive inflammation in the lungs,” Dr Liew said. \n  A computer illustration of viruses coated with white antibodies that fight infection. Photo: Image Team/Canva \n WHAT MAKES THE BODY’S DEFENCES LESS EFFICIENT? \n The immune system slowly declines with age and becomes less efficient in dealing with new infections. This is why old people are vulnerable even to common infections. \n Furthermore, adults usually also have other medical conditions such as ischaemic heart disease or diabetes, which puts them at a higher risk of complications from infections, Dr Liew said. \n Assoc Prof Liu said that as a person ages, there could be a reduced number of infection-fighting lymphocytes that respond to the new infection, or pre-existing conditions that dysregulate immune responses. However, it is impossible to specify an age in which the decline happens.  \n Other factors such as the person’s lifestyle habits, nutrition and mental health status matter, too. \n Dr Melvin Look, a consultant gastrointestinal and laparoscopic surgeon at PanAsia Surgery, pointed out that old people tend to also have micronutrient malnutrition, which can affect their ability to fend off infections.   \n At a media talk on gut health and immunity on Tuesday (Feb 18), Dr Look said that research has found links between the immune system and the gut, which contains 70 per cent of the cells of an immune system. \n “The immune system requires a healthy gut to provide nourishment,” he said. \n “With ageing, the gut is less able to absorb micronutrients from food consumed. Because of the lack of these essential micronutrients, the immune system becomes less efficient.” \n There is also evidence to show that mental health has a big impact on physical health, Dr Look added. \n Psychological stress of any duration, from several days to the chronic types that lasts for years, can cause immunity to go downhill. \n In some cases, the immune system may also go awry, and over-react to perceived threats when it should not. \n Assoc Prof Liu said: “If our immune system is over-reactive to some environmental agents that are not harmful to us, such as dust mite and pollen, we can have allergies. \n \"Autoimmune diseases are caused by an activated immune system targeting our own tissues, resulting in inflammation and damage.” \n HOW DO WE IMPROVE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM? \n While some factors such as genetics or age cannot be changed, the medical experts said that making certain lifestyle changes might be able to improve a person’s response to illness.   \n “People who have a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, balanced nutrition and less stress tend to have a more efficient immune system fighting infections,” Assoc Prof Liu said. \n Support your immune system with the following tips: \n 1. Cut out junk food \n Dr Look said that processed food — refined carbohydrates, sugar, processed meats, fat — disrupts both the gut and immune system. \n “The first thing you should do at a time when you might be prone to infections is to stop taking so much sugar. This is because bacteria, viruses thrive on sugar. The more sugar you keep, the easier it is for them to gain a foothold on your defences,” he said.   \n 2. Ensure a well-balanced diet with nutritious foods \n Dr Liew, who sees more infections in fussy eaters with a low vegetable and fruit intake in his practice, emphasised the importance of a balanced diet with adequate water intake. He said that vitamin C supplementation has the strongest evidence in reducing recurrent infections. \n Dr Look advised increasing the intake of plant-based whole foods that are packed with micronutrients such as zinc, iron, copper, folic acid and vitamins A, B6, C and E. These are required for the body to fight infections. \n The general rule of thumb for healthy eating is to “follow the rainbow”, he said. Eating a wide range of vibrantly coloured fruit and vegetables provide a variety of nutrients needed for good health. These may include vegetables such as tomatoes, berries, pumpkin, oranges, spinach, eggplant and broccoli. \n 3. Consider intermittent fasting \n Dr Look said it has been proven that intermittent fasting, a form of time-restricted fasting, promotes autophagy. This is a process whereby the white blood cells clean out the unhealthy, damaged cells in the body. \n There is no hard and fast rule as to how often one should fast, but Dr Look said that beginners can try a 16-hour fasting, followed by consuming food during an eight-hour window, several times a week. \n All other rules of healthy eating and maintaining adequate nutrition still apply when it is time to eat. \n 4. Get regular doses of sunshine or Vitamin D \n A person who is deficient in Vitamin D is likely to be more susceptible to infections. \n Vitamin D, which is produced by the body when exposed to sunlight and in small quantities in food such as salmon, egg yolk, fortified orange juice and cereal, could boost the immune system, Dr Look said. \n Exposure to sunshine also elevates mood and improves sleep at night, which are also important in maintaining a good immune system. \n The World Health Organization states that getting five to 15 minutes of sunlight on the arms, hands and face twice or thrice a week is sufficient. \n 5. Exercise regularly, but do not overdo it \n One of the basic tenets of healthy living, regular exercise has been linked to fewer colds and infections. \n A study published in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine in 2011 found that moderate exercise of walking improved immune response and reduced incidence of upper respiratory illness. \n People who engaged in regular moderate exercise — such as five days a week of walking 45 minutes each session over 15 weeks — reduced their number of sick days by up to half, compared to sedentary people. \n However, too much intense exercise, such as more than 90 minutes of high-intensity endurance training, has been linked to reduced immunity. \n 6. Manage stress \n Numerous studies have shown the relationship between physical and mental health. Stressed out, isolated people tend to have poorer immune functions, the American Psychological Association said, and recommended stress-relieving tips such as: \n Adopting good lifestyle, sleep and dietary habits \n Cultivating strong social support to improve resilience \n Relaxing muscles through stretching, massages or warm baths \n Meditating for five minutes a day or similar calming activities \n Taking a moment to notice nature \n Reframing thinking to manage emotions \n Seeking professional help \n 7. Take protective measures  \n Even if your immune system is in tip-top condition, taking steps to avoid infection is still important in preventing infections. This is because viruses would have to get into the body to cause disease, Assoc Prof Liu said. \n Assoc Prof Thoon of KKH said that while there are very few cases of Covid-19 infection reported among children, people of any age are susceptible to infection. \n Here, again, are the necessary protective measures against this new coronavirus: \n Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness \n Observe good personal hygiene \n Wash hands with soap and do not touch the eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces that are commonly used \n Cover the mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing and dispose of the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately \n Seek medical attention promptly if feeling unwell and wear a mask \n Children who are too young to comply with strict hand hygiene should be guided by parents and caregivers \n Avoid crowded places \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE  — Mr Leslie Sim, 30, a lawyer, was recently in the lift of his office building with two masked cleaners who were disinfecting the grab rails and buttons when another man entered.  \n “That man asked one of the cleaners if he was from China,” he said.  \n When the cleaner said yes, Mr Sim said that the man pulled back in mock fear and shouted: “Aiyo you China ah, I scared”. \n Over at Chinatown Point, the general manager of Victor’s Kitchen, who only wanted to be known as Mr Liao, said some customers have left his restaurant upon realising that some of its waitresses are from China. \n Although the restaurant has put up signs saying that its Chinese staff have not been to China recently, its footfall has dropped by 30 per cent since end-January, he said. \n These accounts reflect the discrimination being faced by some Chinese nationals here, as anxiety over Covid-19, which originated in the city of Wuhan in China, continues to mount.  \n TODAY spoke to 20 business owners with Chinese workers and all said they have seen business drop, some by as much as 80 per cent. Partly, they think, this is because they have staff from China, and partly because many people are staying at home more these days. \n ‘I AM PLANNING TO LIVE ON SWEET POTATOES’ \n The owner of a hair salon, who declined to be named, said she is struggling to pay rent at the People’s Park Centre unit which she leases, as her regular customers are wary about her being from China and have stopped patronising her business.  \n “Business has been so bad, I am planning to live on sweet potatoes each day for now as I’m not sure how I can get past this month’s rent,” she said. \n She used to earn up to S$100 a day, but in the past two weeks has only been taking in S$30 to S$50 daily.  \n She has also faced outright discrimination, she said. Recently, she wanted to buy masks from a shop in Eunos and was told she would only be allowed to purchase three, even though another customer before her had managed to purchase 10 pieces. \n The reason, she suspects, is that the other customer was a Singaporean, while she is a Chinese national. \n “After the purchase, the staff even scolded me with a derogatory term, saying that Chinese people were responsible for the (Covid-19) virus,” she said. \n Checks by TODAY found that several Chinese-run eateries in Chinatown have begun displaying notices informing customers that their shops have been disinfected or that their staff have not been to China recently.  \n The manager of Dong Fang Mei Shi, a barbecue restaurant in Chinatown, who only wanted to be known as Mr Zhang, said that sales have fallen by 80 per cent from two weeks ago. Among other factors, customers are wary about dining in, as the restaurant has staff from China.  \n “Before the outbreak, we could easily make up to S$10,000 per night. Now, we are struggling to even hit S$2,000,” Mr Zhang said.  \n He added that the drop in customers is also due to a sharp decline in Chinese tourist arrivals and the fact that Singaporeans are reluctant to visit crowded places these days.  \n Supervisor of Da Miao Hotpot in Clarke Quay, Mr Tan Qi Sheng, said the restaurant has seen 70 per cent fewer customers since the Chinese New Year holidays. \n “Customers have asked whether we have workers from China,” he said, adding that some of these customers then chose not to eat at the restaurant after being told that it does. \n Mr Eric Wang, the owner of Spring Heal Spa at Chinatown Point, told TODAY that his business has fallen by 70 per cent since the virus outbreak.  \n “Since massage requires close body contact, a large number of customers have stopped patronising our shop to prevent coming in contact with our staff, many of whom are from China,” he said. \n The manager of a Hai Di Lao branch at Clarke Quay, Ms Zhang Xi, told TODAY that the number of customers at the outlet has halved since the Chinese New Year holiday, although regular diners continue to come. \n “I did encounter one customer who asked how my family’s province in China was, people were generally concerned about me.” \n ‘I DON’T THINK IT’S UNFAIR’  \n Most of the business owners are stoic about their situation, saying that they understand why people are shunning their shops. \n Mr Liao, the manager of Victor’s Kitchen, said: “We are faced with a natural disaster now so I don’t think it’s unfair.” \n Similarly, Mr Luo, a waiter at Ni Pang Zi Grilled Fish at Boat Quay, said he can understand why customers are avoiding the restaurant he works at, which has several workers from China.   \n “I don’t blame them for wanting to avoid Chinese-run establishments because (Covid-19) did originate from China and nobody knows who has the virus,” he said.  \n Mr Luo, who is himself a Chinese national and has lived in Singapore for 18 years, said he still feels welcome here.  \n “I think Singaporeans are some of the most welcoming people to foreigners. Singaporeans are the most kind people to us.” \n Ms Emily Bai, a manicurist who works at Bugis street, said her business has halved since January. She senses that people are keeping a distance from her as she is Chinese, but there is nothing she can do about it, she added. \n “I am a little unhappy, but what can I do?” \n FRUITS, VEGETABLES NOT SPARED FROM ANXIETY \n Singaporeans who spoke to TODAY said they were avoiding Chinese-run establishments because they worry that some of the Chinese nationals working at these places have recently come from the mainland. \n One, who only wanted to be known as Mrs Toh, 65, said: “I want to avoid places with large congregations of those from China, just to be safe.” \n She added that she would not know if the Chinese nationals have recently been in China.  \n Others are going a step further, even avoiding fresh produce from China. \n   Broccoli from China, sold at NTUC Fairprice. Some customers are avoiding fresh produce from China. Photo: Lena Loke/TODAY \n A customer at NTUC Fairprice, who wanted to be known only as Mdm Soh, told TODAY that she has not bought fruits and vegetables imported from China since the outbreak started. \n “I am afraid,” said the 71-year-old retiree. “Before the virus, I would buy broccoli from China. Now, I buy only those imported from Australia or locally produced sweet potato leaves. It costs more but I feel better that way.”  \n A patron at Cold Storage, homemaker Madam Lily Lee, 60, said that she also avoids produce and dried food imported from China.  \n “The virus started from there. So for the time being I will stop buying from there,” she said, adding that she feels the vegetables may not be “clean”.  \n A manager at a Cold Storage outlet in central Singapore, who did not want to be named, said that the store has received many queries from customers about the origins of its fruits and vegetables. \n “Some customers are very particular. Many of them won’t buy these products when they find out they are from China,” he said. He reiterated that the produce from China is safe for consumption as they have been checked thoroughly.  \n ‘A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY’ \n Professor of Sociology Paulin Tay Straughan from the Singapore Management University said that for some Singaporeans, the avoidance of Chinese-run businesses or Chinese produce is a coping mechanism. \n “Whenever there is a crisis that we have little control over, we often give in to fears and irrational reasoning,” she said. “So by giving in to our irrational reasoning, for example by avoiding all things associated with the Chinese, it provides a false sense of security that one is ‘doing something’ to proactively ward off the virus.”  \n Local politicians have noted that such fears are unwarranted and xenophobic. \n Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Feb 1 that the rise of anti-China sentiment worldwide is unhelpful in combating the spread of Covid-19.  \n Speaking at the Chinese New Year dinner at his Teck Ghee constituency, he said: “Even though the virus started in Wuhan, it doesn’t respect nationality or race — anybody can be infected.” \n “This is a problem that all countries must work together to solve, because it can easily get out of control in any one country, not just China.” \n Speaking to reporters on Feb 2 during a visit to the Changi Airport, Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam made the same point, saying that there has been “small pockets” of anti-PRC (People's Republic of China) sentiments online. \n “Disturbingly... we have noticed, a number of racially charged actions, posts... You know, fault lines bubbling below the surface,” he said. “Thankfully, (it is a) small minority.” \n President Halimah Yacob echoed his comments on Feb 11, saying that no community should be blamed for the virus outbreak.  \n “We should also not get into the habit of victim-blaming as viruses do not respect race, language or religion,” she said.  \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Amid expectations of a substantial package to help Singapore cope with the Covid-19 outbreak, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat unveiled during this year’s Budget statement not one, but two special packages totalling S$5.6 billion to help firms and workers, as well as households. \n The packages dwarf the S$230 million package introduced during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2003, and significantly exceed analysts’ expectations. \n They comprise a S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package which will “stabilise the economy and support our workers and enterprises”, as Mr Heng put it, and a S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package to help households with cost of living. \n The special packages come on the back of lacklustre economic growth last year — 0.7 per cent, the weakest since the 2008 global financial crisis. \n On Monday, the Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its economic growth forecast to between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, down from 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. \n In his Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 18), Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, noted that Covid-19 hit Singapore “just as the global economy was beginning to recover”. \n “The outbreak will certainly impact our economy,” said Mr Heng, adding that this is especially so since Singapore’s economy is now much more integrated with the economy of China, where the virus originated.  \n The Government is monitoring the situation and it is ready to do more if necessary to help Singaporeans cope with the economic impact, Mr Heng reiterated.  \n Comprising broad-based measures, the two packages will also feature targeted support, with the less well-off and industries more impacted by the outbreak getting more help. \n   \n  \n BROAD-BASED HELP FOR FIRMS, WORKERS  \n JOBS SUPPORT SCHEME  \n Under the Stabilisation and Support Package, a S$1.3 billion Jobs Support Scheme will be rolled out to benefit all enterprises and their local employees which total more than 1.9 million people. The Government will pay for 8 per cent of the wages of these workers, up to a monthly cap of S$3,600 for three months, said Mr Heng. \n This scheme will help businesses retain Singapore workers and will be given to employers by the end of July. The measures are directed toward Singaporean citizens and permanent residents, as well as both full-time and part-time hires. \n ENHANCED WAGE CREDIT SCHEME \n The Wage Credit Scheme currently co-funds wage increases for Singaporean employees earning a gross monthly wage of up to S$4,000. \n The cap will be raised to S$5,000 for qualifying wage increases given in 2019 and 2020. The Government will also co-fund five percentage points more, raising the levels to 20 per cent for wage raises in 2019 and 15 per cent for those in 2020. \n The enhancement will cost the Government another S$1.1 billion, benefitting 90,000 enterprises and more than 700,000 Singaporean employees, Mr Heng said. \n OTHER INITIATIVES  \n A corporate income tax rebate at the rate of 25 per cent of tax payable, capped at S$15,000 per firm, will also help all tax-paying companies in Singapore. This will cost the Government S$400 million. \n “We will also support tenants and lessees of government-managed properties,” said Mr Heng. \n Tenants and lessees under the JTC Corporation, the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Singapore Land Authority, the Singapore Tourism Board and the Sentosa Development Corporation will receive help with rent, including more flexible rental payments. \n Firms can apply to the relevant agencies which will assess each request individually. \n Several tax treatments under the corporate tax system will also be enhanced for one year, such as allowing a faster write-down of investments in plant and machinery, renovation, and refurbishment under the 2021 year of assessment. \n “This will put more cash in the hands of our enterprises. For example, hotels can now take advantage of this lull period to carry out upgrading work, and be better prepared for the rebound,” said Mr Heng. \n To help enterprises access working capital more easily, the working capital loan component under the Enterprise Financing Scheme will be boosted for one year, with the maximum loan quantum doubled to S$600,000. \n The Government will also bear greater risks for these loans, with its share of risk upped to 80 per cent from the current range of 50 to 70 per cent. \n “With the large part of the risk taken up by the Government, I trust that our financial institutions will do their part to support our viable SMEs (small- and medium-sized enterprises),” said Mr Heng. \n TARGETED HELP FOR SECTORS DIRECTLY HIT BY OUTBREAK  \n Additional help will be given to sectors directly affected by the outbreak — tourism, aviation, food services and retail, as well as point-to-point transport sectors. \n These sectors will be given help to retain and reskill workers. The funding period for reskilling workers through redeployment programmes under the Manpower Ministry’s Adapt and Grow initiative will be increased to a maximum of six months. \n Said Mr Heng: “Together with the Jobs Support Scheme, we will support employers in these sectors to retain and train more than 330,000 local workers. These workers can make full use of the down time for training and upskilling to prepare for the recovery.” \n For the tourism sector, a property tax rebate of 30 per cent will be granted this year to accommodation and function room components of licensed hotels and serviced apartments, as well as venues for Mice (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions). \n International cruise and regional ferry terminals will receive a 15 per cent property tax rebate, while integrated resorts will get a 10 per cent tax rebate. \n A temporary bridging loan programme for the tourism sector will also be rolled out for a year, with a loan quantum of up to S$1 million and interest rates capped at 5 per cent. The Government will also bear 80 per cent of the risk of the loan. \n The aviation sector will benefit from a range of measures, including a 15 per cent property tax rebate for Changi Airport, as well as rebates on aircraft landing and parking charges, assistance for ground handling agents and rental rebates for shops and cargo agents at Changi Airport. \n A Transport Ministry spokesperson said that the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on Singapore’s aviation industry has been significant, with more than 80 per cent of all scheduled flights between Singapore and mainland China cancelled. \n “There are now fewer than 80 services per week, compared with over 400 prior to the outbreak. Passenger traffic has dropped,” said the spokesperson, who added that traffic to Singapore from other regions has also started to decline. \n Food services and retail businesses will also receive rental waivers or rebates. Tenants at National Environment Agency-managed hawker centres and markets will get a full-month of rent waived, and other Government agencies such as HDB will provide a half-month rent waiver to their commercial tenants. \n Those that operate out of private properties will also not be left out — landlords will be granted a 15 per cent property tax rebate for commercial properties that qualify. \n “I strongly urge landlords to pass this on to their tenants by reducing rentals,” Mr Heng said. \n For the point-to-point transport sector, which include taxi operators and private hire car firms, Mr Heng noted that the Transport Ministry had recently announced a support package for these businesses. Many firms in this sector have come forward to support the initiative by matching the Government’s contribution, he added. \n Said Mr Heng: “This spirit of partnership is what we need to weather this challenging period together.” \n More details of the various measures will be revealed in the upcoming debates into the respective ministries’ budgets. \n Mr Heng added that he will elaborate on the S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package in the later part of his speech. \n S$800M BOOST FOR FRONTLINE AGENCIES \n Separately, apart from the two special packages, another S$800 million will be injected to support the frontline agencies dealing with the outbreak. The bulk of the amount will be channelled to the Ministry of Health. \n “This is on top of the substantial resources already committed each year to public health,” said Mr Heng, who then thanked all frontline officers who have been working tirelessly to fight against the outbreak — prompting other members of the House to thump their armrests in support.  \n Paying tribute to the group, he said: “You exemplify the resilience and indomitable spirit of our people. But please take care of yourselves. I am confident that together, we will stay strong and get through these trying times.” \n ",

The new restriction reflects worries in Beijing over the risk posed by so-called imported cases of the virus after widespread lockdowns within China helped to bring domestic transmissions under control. \n Beijing has also ordered airlines to sharply cut international flights from Sunday. \n A commentary in the Communist Party's official People's Daily newspaper on Saturday reflected the concern. \n \"At this time, we must be extremely vigilant and cautious, and we must prevent the post-epidemic relaxation from coming too soon, leading to the loss of all our achievements,\" it said. \n China's National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases.

Actemra also has not received approval from China's National Medical Product Administration to be sold for use for coronavirus infections. \n Chinese researchers recently registered a three-month clinical trial for Actemra that would recruit 188 coronavirus patients and take place from Feb 10 to May 10, according to records shown on China's clinical trials registration database. \n Roche could not be immediately reached for comment. The firm said on Monday it donated 14 million yuan (S$2.8 million) worth of Actemra in February. \n The firm said in January it expects sales and profits growth this year as demand for new drugs and more business in China offsets declines in older medicines whose patents have expired. \n Chinese drugmakers have been racing to develop alternatives to Roche's treatment.

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW DELHI (AFP) - Despite being poorer and more densely populated than China and having a shakier healthcare system, India has officially recorded only 81 cases of the coronavirus and just one death. \n This has raised hopes that the virus that has infected more than 130,000 people and killed 5,000 worldwide might largely pass the world's second-most-populous nation by. \n But with only about 5,000 Indians tested, some experts doubt the official figures and warn that if there is a major outbreak, the country of 1.3 billion is woefully unprepared. \n \"It's hard to imagine there are only so few cases in India,\" Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told AFP. \n \"India's a big country where a lot of people live in very close, compact spaces. It is unclear to me why India would somehow magically skip this pandemic.\" \n India on Friday (March 13) imposed some of the world's toughest border measures in the current crisis, barring most foreigners and suspending visa-free access for millions from the vast diaspora. \n Those arriving, including Indians, who have travelled to virus hotspots such as China and Italy must be quarantined for 14 days. At land borders there is \"robust screening\". \n More than a million air passengers have been screened and authorities have stepped up efforts to identify those with the virus and people in contact with them. \n Hotels in tourist destinations such as Rajasthan have told foreigners to get health certificates. \"We waited two hours at a hospital,\" a woman named Selina from Germany told AFP. \n All mobile calls begin with a recorded health message, preceded by coughing, while social media, newspapers and television carry advice. \n Top sports events are being played to empty venues, while the start of the Indian Premier League - cricket's most lucrative competition - has been postponed. \n Masks and hand sanitiser have sold out in many chemists and online. \n \"We are running 24 hours to produce as much as we can,\" said Ashish Kotadiya at a mask factory in Ahmedabad. \n Domestic flight bookings have plunged 16 percent and tickets are on sale for under $15 on many routes. \n Firms such as Google in Bangalore have asked staff to work at home, while Chinese phone maker Xiaomi, India's top brand, has cancelled new product launches. \n \"One girl was tested positive for coronavirus and hence my entire team at Accenture is working from home,\" said Vaishnavi S., an employee with the consultancy in Pune. \n Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that India could \"break the chain\" in the spread of the virus, but in many ways the country is a paradise for infectious diseases. \n Some 70 million people live in extreme poverty, many in teeming unhygienic slums where working from home or \"social distancing\" is not an option. \n Around 420 people are crammed into every square kilometre of India compared to 148 people in China. Millions also move about internally to find work. \n Health spending is among the world's lowest at 3.7 per cent of GDP, according to Bloomberg News. Some 70 per cent of Indians live in rural areas where healthcare is patchy. \n Some experts say India is not doing enough to create awareness about the coronavirus or to reduce public gatherings. \n Holi, the recent Hindu festival where people smear paint on each other's faces, still saw big crowds in many places. Wedding season also appears largely unaffected. \n There has been some distinctly unscientific advice, with one government ministry pushing homoeopathic and ayurvedic medicine, and social media awash with disinformation. \n Some lawmakers from Modi's party have extolled cow dung and urine, while the chief minister of the most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, suggested yoga could offer protection. \n Jha said India should be testing many more people at its 52 facilities nationwide. \n South Korea has been conducting around 10,000 tests per day, or 220,000 in total as of Wednesday, more than 40 times that of India. \n But K. K. Aggarwal, a former Indian Medical Association president, said the official number of those infected is \"absolutely correct\" and that India is doing enough. \n \"The practice is to examine symptomatic patients,\" as is the case for example in Iran and Italy, Aggarwal told AFP. \n And India's healthcare system has shown itself capable before. \n During an outbreak of the much deadlier Nipah virus in Kerala in 2018, deaths were kept to 17 and human-to-human transmission successfully contained. \n \"I am quite hopeful that in another 10-15 days things will settle down,\" said Rajan Sharma, national president of the medical association. \n The coming hot season may help, Aggarwal added. \n \"SARS and MERS all reduced when summer came. Maybe the heat and humidity will kill the virus,\" he said. \n ",
